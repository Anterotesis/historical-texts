            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE ROBERT DUDLEY, Baron of Denbigh, Earle of Leicester, Knight of the noble Order of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and S. Michaels, Master of the Queenes Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties horse, and one of her Privy Councell, high Chauncellour of the Vniversity of Oxford, my singular good Lord.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat my travaile into Ireland, might seeme nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther causlesse, nor fruitlesse, I have thought it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, being one member of your Lordships honorable charge to yeeld you this poore book, as an accompt of my poore voyage, happily not the last, nor the most beautifull present that is intended to your Honour by me, but surely more full of unsavoury toyle for the time, then any plot of worke that ever I attempted, which I write, not of vanity to commend my diligence, but of necessitie to excuse mine imperfection. For whereas it is well knowne to the learned in this land, how late it was ere I could meet with <hi>Gerald</hi> of Wales, the onely Author that ministreth some indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent furniture to this Chronicle, and with what search I have beene driven to piece out the rest by helpe of forreine Writers (incidently touching this Realme) by a number of briefe extracts of rolles, records and scattered papers. These things (I say) considered, I trust this little volume shall seeme great enough in such barren shift, &amp; my defect in penning the same shalbe imputed partly to my haste, who must needes have ended all before I should leave the land, and am now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon point of my departure. So as to handle and lay these
<pb facs="tcp:18659:5"/>
things together, I had not in all the space of ten weekes. Such as it is, I addresse and bequeath it to your good Lordship, for two causes. First that by the patronage of this Booke you may be induced to weigh the estate and become a patron to this noble Realme, which claimeth kindred of your eldest auncestors, and loveth entirely your noble vertues: The fame whereof is now carried by those strangers that have felt them into many forraine countryes that never saw your person. Secondly because there is none that knoweth mee familiarly, but he knoweth vvithall how many vvayes I have beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to your Lordship. The regard of your deserts and of my duty hath easily wonne at my hands this testimony of a thankefull minde. I might be thought ambitious, if I should recount in particular the times &amp; places of your severall cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies to mee. How often at Oxford, how often at the Court, how at Rycot, how at Windsore, how by letters, hovv by reportes, you have not ceased to further with advice and to countenance with authority, the hope and expectation of mee a single Student. Therefore in summe it shall suffice mee to acknowledge the generall heape of your bounties, and for them all to serve your honour frankely, at least wise with a true heart: Let every man esteeme in your state and fortune, the thing that best contenteth and feedeth his admiration; But surely to a judgement setled and rectified, these outward felicities which the world gazeth on, are there, and therefore to be denied, praiseable when they lodge those inward qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the minde, which (saving for suspition of flattery) I was about to say are planted in your breast. Thirteene yeares to have lived in the eye and speciall credit of a Prince, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver during all that space to have abused this ability to any mans harme, to be enriched with no mans overthrow, to be kindled neither with grudge nor emulation, to benefit an infinite resort of dayly sutors, to let downe your calling to the neede of meane subjects, to retaine so lowly a stomacke, such a facility, so milde a nature in so high a vocation, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the tuition of learning and learned men. These are indeede the kirnels for the which the shell of your nobilitie
<pb facs="tcp:18659:5"/>
seemeth faire and sightly; This is the sap, for whose preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the barke of your noble tree is tendered. This is the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance which maketh you worthy of these Ornaments wherevvith you are attyred, and in respect of these good gifts as I for my part have ever bin desirous to discover an offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and dutifull minde towards your Lordship, so will I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cease to betake the uttermost of my power and skill to your service, nor to begge of Almighty God your plentifull increase in godlines, wisedome and prosperity. Fare you well: From Dublin 27. May, 1571.</p>

It remaineth that <hi>I</hi> request my Countrymen to bend their good liking to my goodwill, and the English of Ireland to favour the memory of their noble auncestors, both twaine to deliver me from all undue and wrong suspitions, howsoever the priviledge of an history hath tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mine inke with sweet or sowre ingredients.

Secondly, that it may appeare how much Ireland is beholding to God for suffering them to be conquered, whereby many of these enormities were cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and more might be, would themselves be plyable.</p>

When he had said his minde, the Priest demaunded him, whether he were faultlesse in the sinne of Homicide?

So much of their old Customes. Now a few words of their trade at this present.</p>
                     <p>Cleare men they are of Skinne and hue, but of themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves carelesse and bestiall.

                     <p>Their infants of the meaner sort, are neither swadled, nor lapped in Linnen, but foulded up starke naked into a Blankett till they can goe, and then if they

get a piece of rugge to cover them, they are well sped. Linnen shirts the rich doe weare for wantonnes and bravery, with wide hanging sleeves playted, thirtie yards are little enough for one of them. They have now left their Saffron, and learne to wash their shirts, foure or five times in a yeare. Proud they are of long crisped glibbes, and doe nourish the same with all their cunning: to crop the front thereof they take it for a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table peece of villany<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Shamrotes, Water-cresses, Rootes, and other hearbes they feede upon: Oatemale and Butter they cramme together. They drinke Whey, Milke, and Beefe broth, Flesh they devoure without bread, corne such as they have they keepe for their horses. In haste and hunger they squese out the blood of raw flesh, and aske no more dressing thereto, the rest boyleth in their stomackes with Aquavitae, which they swill in after such a surfeite, by quarts &amp; pottles. Their kyne they let blood which growen to a jelly they bake and over-spread with Butter, and so eate it in lumpes.</p>
                     <p>One office in the house of great men is a tale-teller, who bringeth his Lord on sleepe, with tales vaine and frivolous, whereunto the number give sooth and credence. So light they are in beleeving whatsoever is with any countenance of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie affirmed by their Superiours, whom they esteeme and honour, that a lewd Prelate within these few yeares needy of money, was able to perswade his parish: That S. <hi>Patricke</hi> in striving with S. <hi>Peter</hi> to let an Irish Galloglass into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, had his head broken with the keyes, for whose releife he obtained a Collation.</p>
                     <p>Without either precepts or observation of congruity they speake Latine like a vulgar language, learned in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Schooles of Leach-craft and Law, whereat they begin Children, and hold on sixteene or twentie yeares conning by roate the Aphorismes of <hi>Hypocrates,</hi> and the Civill Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and a few other parings of those two faculties. I have seene them where they kept Schoole, ten in some one Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, groveling upon couches of straw, their Bookes at their noses, themselves lying flatte prostate, and so to chaunte out their lessons by peece-meale, being the most part lustie fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes

of twenty five yeares and upwards.</p>
                     <p>Other Lawyers they have, liable to certaine families which after the custome of the country determine and judge causes. These consider of wrongs offered and received among their neighbours, be it murder, or fellony, or trespasse, all is redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by composition, (except the grudge of parties seeke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge:) and the time they have to spare from spoyling and proyning, they lightly bestow in parling about such matters. The Breighoon (so they call this kind of Lawyer) sitteth him downe on a banke, the Lords and Gentlemen at variance round about him, and then they proceede.</p>
                     <p>They honour devoute Fryars and Pilgrimes, suffer them to passe quietly, spare them and their mansions, whatsoever out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage they shew to the country besides them. To robbe and prey their enemies, they deeme it none offence, nor seeke any meanes to recover their losse, but even to watch them the like turne. But if neighbours and friends send their Cators to purloyne one another, such Actions are judged by the Breighoones aforesaid.</p>
                     <p>Toward the living they are noysome and malicious, the same being dead they labour to avenge eagerly and fiercely. They love and trust their Foster Brethren more then their owne. <hi>Turlogh Leinagh Oneale</hi> that now usurpeth, is said to repose in them his greatest surety.</p>
                     <p>Strumpets are there too vile and abominable to write of, which not onely without feare, but also without remorse doe advance themselves in numbring what noblemen have had liking to their bodies. Hee that can bring most of his name into the field, base or other, triumpheth exceedingly. For increase of which name, they allow themselves not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whoores, but also choise &amp; store of whoores. One I heard named which hath (as he calleth them) more then ten wiues, in twentie places.</p>
                     <p>There is among them a brother-hood of Carrowes that professe to play at Cards all the yeare long, and make it their onely occupation. They play away Mantle and all to the bare skinne, and then trusse themselves in strawe or in leaves,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18659:19"/>
they waite for passengers in the high way, invite them to a game upon the greene, and aske no more but companions to hold them sport, for default of other stuffe they pawne portions of their glibbe, the nailes of their fingers and toes, their privie members; which they lose or redeeme at the curtesie of the winner.</p>
                     <p>Where they fancie and favour, they are wonderfull kinde, they exchange by commutation of wares for the most part, and have utterly no coyne stirring in any great Lords houses. Some of them be richly plated: their Ladies are trimmed ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with massie Iewels, then with garish apparell, it is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a beautie in them to be tall, round and fat.</p>
                     <p>The inheritance descendeth not to the Sonne, but to the Brother, Nephew, or Cousin germaine eldest and most vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant: for the Childe being oftentimes left in nonage or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise young and unskillfull, were never able to defend his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie, being his no longer then he can hold it by force of armes. But by that time he grow to a competent age, and have buryed an Vncle or two, he also taketh his turne, and leaveth it in like order to his Posterity.

                     <p>To all this when their owne free assent, the dedition of other Princes, lawfull conquest and prescription is adjoyned, it forceth an invincible title.

At this time the countrey was first named <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernia,</hi> as I have declared in the third Chapter. The King to avoyde obloquie and slaunder, purged himselfe to his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that neither maliciously nor contentiously, but for his necessary defence and safeguard he had borne armes against his brother. And to witnesse how farre he was from desire to rule alone, he nominated speciall Captaines to be Kings under him of their severall Countryes, reserving to himselfe but one fourth part, and the portion of Meth allotted to the Monarchie for the better maintenance of his part.</p>

The Pope invested him Archbishop and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the whole Iland, blessed him, commaunded publique prayer and fasting, brought him and his disciples onward on the voyage. Therefore in the tvventie third yeare of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odosius</hi> the younger, which was the yeare of our Lord 430. <hi>Patricke</hi> landed in Ireland: and because he spake the tongue plentifully, being a reverent personage, he tooke holy Bible, adding thereto diverse miracles in the Name &amp; vertue of IE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS whom he preached: many listened unto him, namely such as in the late entertainement of <hi>Palladius</hi> and <hi>Albius</hi> the Irish Bishops his Disciples, had some little feeling in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell.

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Very History of Ireland that I have seene, maketh one severall title <hi>De mirabilibus Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berniae,</hi> and therein with long processe trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of severall Ilands, some full of Angels, some full of devils, some for male only, some for female, some where poore may live, some where none can dye: finally such effects of waters, stones, trees, and trinkets, that a man would vveene them to be but heedlesse and uncertaine tales by their complexion.</p>
                     <p>Verily, being inquisitive of these matters, I could finde no one of them soothed by such persons upon whose relation I am disposed to venture. Onely the place behinde Ardmagh called S. <hi>Patricks</hi> Purgatory, because it is knovvne and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, and because I vvould be discharged of my Readers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, who perhaps vvith the name of S. <hi>Patricke</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to bee informed thereof, I can bee content to put so much in vvriting, as Bookes and reports affirme vvith most likelyhood.</p>
                     <p>Tvvo things I muse at, that neither the time nor the author
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:18659:29"/>
of so strange erection was preserved. Concerning the time one Record putteth it in Anno Domini 302. which is 128. yeares before S. <hi>Patricke</hi> converted Ireland, and sixty sixe yeares before his birth. Againe <hi>Cambrensis</hi> who maketh curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous recitall of wonders in the land, never uttereth word of this Purgatory; &amp; though a negative authority be not invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, yet considering the propertie of that man, and what a sort of trifles he taketh paine to justifie, it may serve for a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement suspition, that the place was then either not found, or not miraculous. Concerning the Author, very few there are that referre it to this <hi>Patricke</hi> their Apostle, but rather to an Abbot of the same name, whom I marvaile I finde not in the mighty bigge volume of their Saints: Notwithstanding these Originalls might bee either lost or altered, but the thing it selfe being extant, must needes have had a beginning, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of possibly there are monuments in that Church, or in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish tongue to me unwitting.</p>
                     <p>Therefore I hold him unwise that will utterly mistrust the principall, because the circumstances vary; or condemne the vvhole, because he could not reach to the undoubted truth of some part. If any man bee so delicate, that not a jote thereof vvill sinke into his head, vvho shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troule him? neither hee nor vvee are bound to believe any story besides that vvhich is delivered us from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, and the consent of Gods Church. Let the discreet Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der judge of it.</p>
                     <p>This I learne, that the holy Abbot <hi>Patricius secundus,</hi> not the Bishop their Apostle, laboured the conversion of the people of Vlster, vvhich being novv Christians, could yet at no hand be vvonne to renounce their olde sensuality, cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,<note place="margin">Polichro l. 1. ca. 35. Trevis. ibid.</note> murthers, extortion. And vvhen he much inforced the life to come, they replyed unto him vvith contempt, that unlesse they savv proofes of these Ioyes and paines hee preached, they vvould never leese possession of the pleasures in hand, for hope or dread of things to come they vvist not vvhen. At their importunacie hee besought God, vvere it his good pleasure to give out some evident token
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18659:29"/>
of the maters they required: finally by the special direction of God he found in the north edge of Vlster a desolate angle hemmed in round, &amp; in the mids thereof a pit, where he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a Church, closed the same with a wall, bestowed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Canons regular, at the East end of this Church yarde, a doore leadeth into a closet of stone, which they call the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, because devout people have resorted thither for pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and reported at their returne, strange visions of paine and blisse appearing to them. They used to continue therein foure &amp; twenty houres, which doing one while with ghost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meditations, and another while a dreadfull conscience of their deserts, they saw as they say, a plaine resembling of their owne faults and vertues, with the horror and comfort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to belonging, that one so terrible, the other so joyous, that they verily deeme themselves for the time to have sight of heaven and hell. The revelations of men that went in (Saint <hi>Patricke</hi> yet living) are kept vvritten vvithin the saide Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey. When any person is disposed to enter (for the doore is ever sparred) he repaireth first for advice to the Archbishop, vvho casteth all perils, and dissvvadeth him, because they say diverse never came backe againe, but if the party be resolute, he recommendeth him to the Pryor, vvho in like manner fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourably exhorteth him not to hazard such a danger, if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvithstanding he finde the party fully bent, he conducteth him to this Church, enjoyneth him to begin vvith prayer, fast and vigill o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This time expired, if he yet persevere in his former purpose, the vvhole Convent accompanieth him vvith so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne procession and benediction to the mouth of the cave, vvhere they let him in, &amp; so barre up the doore till the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovv, &amp; then vvith like ceremonies they avvaite his returne, &amp; reduce him to the Church. If he be seene no more, they fast &amp; pray 15. dayes after. Touching the credit of those matters, I see no cause but a Christian man assuring himself that there is both hel &amp; heaven, may vvithout vanity upon sufficient in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, be persuaded that it might please God at somtime for considerations to his infinit vvisdome knovvn to reveale
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18659:30"/>
by miracles the vision of Ioyes &amp; paines eternal, but that alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in such sort, &amp; so ordinarily, &amp; to such persons, and by such meanes as the common fame &amp; some records therof doe utter, I neither believe, nor wish to be regarded. It appeares by <hi>Trevisa</hi> in his additions to <hi>Polichronicon,</hi> that a superstitious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of this Purgatory was then conceived, which he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth. And a man of indifferent judgement may soone su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect that in the drift and strength of Imagination, a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative person would happely suppose the sight of many strange things which he never saw. Since writing hereof I met with a Priest, who told mee that he had gone the same pilgrimage, and affirmed the order of the premisses: But that he for his owne part saw no sight in the world, save onely fearefull dreames when he chanced to nod, and those he saith were exceeding horrible: further he added, that the faste is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more or lesse, according to the quality of the penitent, and that the place seemed to him scarcely able to receive sixe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>

Of which brethren there were in one day murthred 900. and the place spoyled, whose possessions conveyed to <hi>Malachias</hi> by his Vncle, hee restored forthwith, and bettered the foundation.

When all the people wept and howled, for his perill, he alone stepped into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of his enemies, demaunding their purpose. The very Tyrants letting fall their weapons in stead of the murder conspired, fell to reverence him and departed friends. Three yeares he sate in the primacy, rather to discontinue the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible corruption before used, then with intent to abide there: and their error having disanulled the abuse, he procured <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasius</hi> to be his Successor, and returned to his former Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke of Downe. For to Downe was then annexed Coner. But <hi>Malachias</hi> understanding that in times past, they were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall, sundred them againe, and preferred another to the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of Coner, desirous rather to discharge his cure, then to enlarge the fruites, while he preached, a woman fell at his feete, and besought his prayer, for that she had gone now with childe fifteene moneths and twenty dayes, nor could by any meanes be delivered, which done, the newes of her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very was reported before the assembly brake up. Hee threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vengance to a Captaine, unlesse he would turne away the Concubine he kept, the same being also his brothers Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubine. The Captaine tooke it disdainefully, and within one houre, was slaine by a conspiracy of women, whose Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and servants he had defiled. There dwelt in Lismore a notable Clerke, of conversation upright, but corrupt in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of religion, this fellow advancing his doctrine, offered disputation to the Bishop, before the multitude, when he was forced to silence with the waight of truth, yet he cavelled maliciously, that not the cause nor learning, but the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and credit of <hi>Malachias</hi> had wonne the victory. To whom the Bishop answered, our Lord compell thee, even maugre thine owne willfullnesse to acknowledge thine er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. At these words the Clerke and intending to fly the sight of men, was prevented with a mortall infirmity, and beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bishop of his peace and communion, died immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, reconciled to God and holy Church. Being demaunded of his Brethren, the Moncks of Banchor, where and when hee

would wish to dye, and be buryed, if it lay in his choyse, hee answered: If in Ireland, beside the body of S. <hi>Patricke</hi>: If be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the seas, at Clarivall, where S. <hi>Bernard</hi> was then famous and in the feast of <hi>All Soules.</hi> He cast in his minde, within a few dayes to sue to <hi>Eugenius</hi> the third, for the increase of the number of Metropolitanes, which request, was shortly after sped, and in this voyage he rested at Clarivall, and there di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse times, openly foretold that his yeare of departing was come: accordingly when he had taken leave of S. <hi>Bernard</hi> and the brethren, descended from his chamber to Church, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the rites of a christian man, he returned to his lodging, and dyed on <hi>All Soules</hi> day, in the yeare of his age fifty foure,<note place="margin">1148.</note> so mildely and peaceably that it seemed rather a sleepe, then a death.

But such a friend as you are to mee and mine, neither I nor mine shall live to see, and I purpose not to offend your amity with saving a greater mater then twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty maiden-heads, seeing fathers have not sticked to yeeld their owne wives to quench the loves and lustes of their sonnes.</p>

                     <p>Scarce had he spoken the vvord, but vvith great shovvtes and clamours, they extolled the King as patron of their lives and families, assured both courage and expedition, joyned their confederates, and vvith a running campe, svvept every corner of the Land, razed the castles to the ground, &amp; chased the strangers before them, slevv all that abode the battaile, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered each man his ovvne precinct and former state of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.

The former subjection though it seemed intollerable, yet they felt therein a grovving to peace, fruits of merchandize, rest &amp; surety; for it fared di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versly tvvixt those Easterlings, &amp; these Irish: they knevv hovv to thrive, might they get some commodious soyle.

By exchanging of vvares &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, finding the Normans civill and tractable, delighted also vvith gay conceipts, vvhich they never esteemed needfull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they savv them, they entred into a desire of traffique vvith other nations, to allure marchants, they licensed the strangers aforesaid to build, if they vvere disposed, Haven-Tovvnes, vvhich vvas done.<note place="margin">Waterford.

                     <p>With these letters and many gay additions of his owne, he arrived at Bristow, where he fell at conference with <hi>Richard Strongbow,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Lo. Strongbow al. Chepstowe.</note> Earle of Pembroke, with whom he covenanted, the delivery of his onely daughter and heire unto marriage,

and so the remainder of his Kingdome: If the said Earle would recover him his home. That day were planted in Wales two gentlemen, <hi>Robert Fitz Stephens,</hi> and <hi>Maurice Fitz Gerald,</hi> brethren of a Mother, allyed to <hi>Rice ap Griffin,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Fitz Stephens. Fitz Gerald.</note> then Prince of Wales, whose Grand-father was surnamed <hi>Rice</hi> the great. <hi>Fitz Stephens</hi> had beene high Constable there under the King, and for executing rigour upon the Princes servants, was with him detained prisoner three yeares, ne would in any wise pay ransome or accept the liberty promised him, but if the conditions were loyall to the Crowne, and to his person no dis-worship. Lastly by the mediation of <hi>David</hi> Bishop of S. Davids, the third brother; and of <hi>Fitz Gerald,</hi> and at the instance of <hi>Mac Murrough</hi> whom the Prince entertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in that distresse, <hi>Fitz Stephens</hi> was conditionaly delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that he and his brother <hi>Maurice,</hi> should the next spring, while <hi>Strongbow</hi> provided his army, assist the Irish out-cast, who in consideration thereof assured them an estate for ever in the towne of Weixford, and two Cantreds adjoyning.</p>
                     <p>Thus much firmely concluded on all sides, the King stale secretly home, and wintered closely among the Cleargie of Fernes.</p>
                     <p>According to covenant came <hi>Fitz Stephens,</hi> with 30. Knights of his blood, 60. Squiers, &amp; 300. footemen Archers, to whom at his landing, <hi>Dermot</hi> sent in aid his base sonne <hi>Duvelnaldus,</hi> and five hundred speares. The towne and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbes of Weixford marched forth against him: But when they saw Souldiours in array, diversly dighted and weapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, furnished with artillery, barbed horses and harnesse, they retyred to their walles and strengthned them, burning the villages thereabouts, and all the provision they could not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The assault lasted 3. dayes, in the 4. certaine Bishops re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciant there, tooke up the variance, pacified the Townesmen to their King, and procured the rendring of the Towne. <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot</hi> having tryed the valiantnes of the Welchmen, immeadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately kept his touch, and gave possession of Weixford with the appurtenances aforesaid, to <hi>Fitz Stephens</hi> and his brother. After successe of these matters, they leavyed to the number
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18659:38"/>
of 3000. Souldiours, and devised to vexe the Lords of Vpper Ossory, who had beene to the King of all other most cruell and injurious. Them they compelled to deliver Trewage and sweare fealty.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rodericke</hi> the monarch appalled at these newes, reared up all the Kings, in defence of the land, verily supposing that all would to wrecke, were it not prevented. And first they dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted courteous messages and gifts to <hi>Fitz Stephens,</hi> moving him to depart the land quietly, and not to molest them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cause. To whom he answered, that much he wondred at the folly of those Princes, who to satisfie their choller had opened such a gappe to their owne prejudice, as though the subjects whom they had schooled, to breake allyance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the King of Leinster, would not be as ready by this example to learne to withstand the King of Connaght, for his owne part, though hee might with better reason invade strangers, then they could expell their neighbours and their peere, yet would they suffer the King to reenter his right, they should not finde him stiffe, nor untractable, otherwise they should well feele that the Bryttons wanted neither abilitie, nor truth, to maintaine their word.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rodericke</hi> perceived it was no boote to spurne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bethought himselfe of composition upon agreement, they resolved thus.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Conditions of peace.</note>
                        <hi>Inprimis,</hi> that <hi>Mac Murrough</hi> swearing afresh his obedience to the Monarch, should quietly, repossesse the parts of Lein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, which <hi>Rodericke</hi> with-held by suspensation.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that for ensurance thereof, he should pledge his dearest base sonne <hi>Cnothurn,</hi> to whom <hi>Rodericke</hi> promised his daughter, if this peace were found effectuall.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that being rested in his kingdome, he should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Welch army, nor should henceforwards call them over in defence.</p>
                     <p>About this time, <hi>Donatus</hi> the good King of Ergall, foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Abbey of Mellyfont, which is the eldest that I finde recorded since the Danes arrivall, except S. <hi>Mary</hi> Abbey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Divelin, erected in an. 948.</p>

The King halfe in derisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bad him on in the name of God, even as farre as his feete could beare him. The Earle dissembling to perceive the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lovvnes of the king, furnished his Cousin <hi>Reymond le Grose,</hi>

When Waterford was gotten, and Leinster pacified, and the Princes of Ossory tamed, and a chosen band ever in garrison, <hi>Mac Murrough</hi> became so terrible, that none durst encounter him. The Cleargy assembled themselves at Ardmagh, and with one accord did protest that for all their sinnes, and especially for the Turkish kinde of Tyrany which they used in buying and selling, and with vile slaveries oppressing the bodies of the English, (whom their pyrats tooke) their land was like

to be translated to that nation, whose captives they handled so cruelly. To appease in part, the indignation of God, they decreed, that all English, wheresoever in hold within the realme, should forthwith be loosed, Further, if it pleased God to scourge them, it should be meekely suffered, as farre beneath the debt of their deserts. King <hi>Henry,</hi> though he was well apayed that the Earle should be from him, yet he liked no deale, his growing in Ireland to such power, as percase in time to come, with his faction in Wales, then living under a Prince of their owne, he might be able to face the Crowne of England. An edict was therefore drawne, whereby all subjects were charged upon their perill, to reverte into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land by a day, and a caveat annexed, that upon paine of death, none should presume to passe over without a nevv warrant, nor ship over any wares, money, munition, or victuals into Ireland.</p>

                        <item>9. It would aske a volume to recite the names of such Irish Princes, who since the conquest have continually upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, revolts or petitions, sworne truth and faith to the kings of England, from time to time, received honours, wages, fees, pardons, and petitions. And thus I thinke no reasonable man will doubt of a right so old, so continued, so ratified, so many wayes confessed.</item>

and had learned of the Priest such princely behaviour, that he lightly moved the said Earle, and many Nobles of Ireland tendering the Seed Royall of <hi>Richard Plantagenet,</hi> and <hi>George</hi> his sonne, as also maligning the advancement of the house of Lancaster, in <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, either to thinke or make the world weene, they thought verily this childe to bee <hi>Edward</hi> Earle of Warwicke, the Duke of Clarences lawfull Sonne.</p>
                     <p>And although King <hi>Henry</hi> more then halfe marred their sport, in shewing the right Earle through all the streetes of London, yet the Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> Dutchesse of Burgoine, sister to <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, <hi>Iohn de la Poole</hi> her Nephew, the Lord <hi>Lovel,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Broughton</hi> Knight, and diverse other Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of this conspiracy devised to abuse the colour of this young Earles name, for preferring their purpose, which if it came to good, they agreed to depose <hi>Lambert,</hi> and to erect the very Earle indeed now prisoner in the towre, for whose quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell had they pretended to fight, they deemed it likely hee should have beene made away: Wherefore it was blazed in Ireland, that the King to mocke his subjects, had schooled a Boy to take upon him the Earle of Warwickes name, and had shewed him about London to blinde the eyes of simple folkes, and to defeate the lawfull Inheritour of the good Duke of Clarence, their countryman and Protectour during his life, to whose linage they also derived a title of the Crowne. In all haste they assembled at Divelin, and there in Christ-Church they Crowned this Idoll, honouring him with titles imperiall, feasting and triumphing, rearing migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty shoutes and cryes, carrying him from thence, to the Kings Castle upon tall mens shoulders, that he might be seene and noted, as he was surely an honourable Boy to looke upon.

Betweene him and <hi>Iames Butler</hi> Earle of Ormond, their owne jealousies fed with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and ambition, kindled with certaine lewd factions, abbet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of either side: ever since the ninth yeare of <hi>Henry</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, when <hi>Iames</hi> of Ormond with a great army of Irish men, camping in S. <hi>Thomas</hi> Court at Divelin, seemed to face the countenance and power of the Deputy:<note place="margin">Register of Majors.</note> these occasions I say fostered a mallice betwixt them and their posterityes, many yeares after incurable, causes of much ruffle and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietnes in the Realme, untill the confusion of the one house, and nonage of the other, discontinued their quarrels, which except their Inheritours have the grace to put up, and to love unfainedly, as <hi>Gerald</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> doe now, may hap to turne their countryes to little good, and themselves to lesse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ormond</hi> was nothing inferiour to the other in stomacke, and in reach of pollicy farre beyond him; <hi>Kildare</hi> was in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement a milde man, to his enemies intractable, to the Irish such a scourge, that rather for despite of him then for fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of any part, they relyed upon the <hi>Butlers,</hi> came in under his protection, served at his call, performed by starts, as their manner is, the duty of good subjects.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Ormond</hi> was secret and drifty, of much moderation in speech, dangerous of every little wrinkle that touched his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation. <hi>Kildare</hi> was open and passionable, in his moode desperate, both of word and deede, of the English welbelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, a good lusticier, a warriour incomparable, towards the Nobles that he favoured not somewhat headlong and unru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, being charged before <hi>Henry</hi> the seventh, for burning the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:18659:62"/>
Church at Cashell, and many witnesses prepared to avouch against him, the truth of that article, he suddainely confessed the fact, to the great wondering and detestation of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, when it was looked how he would justifie the matter, By Iesus (quoth he) I would never have done it, had it not beene told me that the Archbishop was within. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Archbishop was one of his busiest accusers there present, merrily laught the King at the plainenesse of the man, to see him alleadge that intent for excuse, which most of all did aggravate his fault. The last article against him they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in these tearmes, finally all Ireland cannot rule this Earle: No (quoth the King) then in good faith shall this Earle rule all Ireland. Thus was the accusation turned to a jest, the Earle returned Lord Deputy, shortly after created Knight of the Garter and so died. Marvell not if this successe were a corrosive to the adverse party, which the longer it held aloofe and bit the bridle, the more eagerly it followed his course, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving once the sway and roome at will, as you may perceive hereafter.</p>

A Gentleman valiant and well spoken, yet in his lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter time overtaken with vehement suspition of sundry Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. He of good meaning to unite the families, matched his Sister <hi>Margaret Fitz Gerald,</hi> with <hi>Pierce Butler</hi> Earle of Osso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whom he also holpe to recover the Earledome of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, whereinto after the decease of <hi>Iames,</hi> a Bastard brother had intruded.</p>

                        <hi>Thomas Howard</hi> Earle of Surrey, Grandfather to this Duke of Norfolke, accompanied with 200. of the Kings guarde. While he sate at Dinner in the Castle of Divelin, hee heard newes that <hi>Oneale</hi> with a mighty army was even in the mouth of the borders, ready to invade: Immediately men were levyed by the Major, and the next morrow joyning them to his band, the Lieutenant marched as farre as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Slane, where having intelligence of <hi>Oneales</hi> recoyle, hee dismissed the footemen, and pursued <hi>Omore</hi> with his horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which <hi>Omore</hi> was said to lurke within certaine miles. That espied a Gunner of <hi>Omore,</hi> and watching by a wood side discharged his peece at the very face of the Deputy, strake the visard of his helmet, and pierced no further (as God would.) This did he in manner recklesse what became of himselfe, so he might amaze them for a time, breake the swiftnesse of their following, and advantage the flight of his Captaine, which thing he wanne with the price of his owne blood, for the Souldiours would no further, till they had searched all the corners of that wood, verily suspecting some ambush thereabout, and in severall knots ferretted out this Gunner, whom <hi>Fitz VVilliams</hi> and <hi>Bedlowe</hi> of the Roche were faine to mangle and hewe in peeces; because the wretch would never yeeld.</p>

Now there was a great partaker of all the Deputies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, one <hi>Robert Talbot</hi> of Belgard whom the <hi>Geraldines</hi> hated deadly, him they surmized to keepe a Kalender of all their doings and to stirre the coales that incensed brother against

In which fury, <hi>Iames Fitz Gerald</hi> meeting the said Gentleman besides Ballimore, slew him even there;<note place="margin">Talbot of Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard slaine.</note> jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neying to keepe his Christmasse with the Deputy. With this despitefull murder both sides brake out into open rage, and especially the Countesse of Ossory, <hi>Kildares</hi> sister, a rare woman, and able for wisedome to rule a Realme, had not her stomacke over-rul'd her selfe. Heere beganne intimation of new Treasons passing to and fro, with complaints and replyes. But <hi>Suffolke</hi> had wrought the canvas so fast in his sonne in lawes behalfe, that hee was suffered to rest at home, and onely Commissioners directed thither with Authority to examine the roote of their griefes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if they found <hi>Kildare</hi> but even tollerably purged, their instructions was to depose the plaintiffe, and to sweare the other Lord Deputy. The Commissioners were, Sir <hi>Raphe Egerton,</hi> a Cheshire Knight, <hi>Anthony Fitzherbert,</hi> second Iustice of the Common-pleas, and <hi>Iames Denton,</hi> Deane of Lichfield, who huddeled up those accusations as they thought good, and suddenly tooke the sword from the Earle of Ossory, sware the <hi>Geraldine</hi> Lord Deputy, before whom <hi>Con Oneale</hi> bare the sword that day. Concerning the murtherer whom they might have hanged, they brought him prisoner into England, presented him to Cardinall <hi>VVolsey,</hi> who vvas said to hate <hi>Kildares</hi> bloud: And the Cardinall intending his execution vvith more dishonour to the name, caused him to be ledde about London streetes manacled and haltered, vvhich asked so long time, that the Deane of Lichfield stepped to the King, and got the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man his pardon.</p>
                     <p>This untimely shift inflamed the Cardinall, and ripened the malice hitherto not so ranke, and therefore hereafter <hi>Osso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> brought evident proofes of the Deputies disorder, that hee vvilfully vvinked at the Earle of Desmond, vvhom hee should have attached by the Kings letters, that he curryed acquaintance and friendship vvith meere Irish enemyes, that he had armed them against him being the Kings Deputy, that he hanged and hevved rashly good subiects, vvhom hee
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18659:64"/>
mistrusted to leave to the <hi>Butlers</hi> friendship. Yet againe therefore was <hi>Kildare</hi> commaunded to appeare, which he did, leaving in his roome <hi>Fitz Gerald</hi> of <hi>Leixlip,</hi> whom they shortly deprived,<note place="margin">1527</note> and chose the Baron of Delvin, whom <hi>O-Connor</hi> tooke prisoner, and there the Earle of Osso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to shew his ability of service, brought to Divelin an army of Irish-men, having Captaines over them <hi>Oconnor, Omore</hi> and <hi>O-Carroll,</hi> and at S. <hi>Mary</hi> Abbey, was chosen Deputie by the Kings Councell.</p>
                     <p>In which office (being himselfe, save onely in feates of Armes, a simple gentleman) he bare out his honour, and the charge of governement, very worthily, through the singular wisedome of his Countesse,<note place="margin">The Countesse of Ossory.</note> a Lady of such port, that all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states of the Realme couched unto her, so politique, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was thought substantially debated without her advice, manlike and tall of stature, very rich and bountifull, a bitter enemy, the onely meane at those dayes whereby her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands Countrey was reclaymed from the sluttish and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane Irish custome to the English habite, bedding, house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeping, and civility.</p>
                     <p>But to those vertues vvas yoked such a selfe-liking, and such a Majesty above the tenure of a subiect, that for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance thereof shee sticked not to abuse her husbands honour against her brothers follye. Notvvithstanding I learne not that shee practised his undoing, (vvhich ensued, and vvas to her undoubtedly, great heavinesse, as upon vvhom both the blemish thereof, and the sustenance of that vvhole family depended after,) but that shee by indirect meanes vvrought her Brother out of credite to advance her husband, the common voyce, and the thing it selfe speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                     <p>All this vvhile abode the Earle of Kildare at the Court, and vvith much adoe found shift to bee called before the Lords, to ansvvere solemnely.

<pb n="111" facs="tcp:18659:64"/>
could be gathered thereof in these words.</p>

Ter-owen, commonly called Tirone, to be held of the King of English forme and tenure: Armes he gave the bloody hand a terrible cognizance.

Then addressed he plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible letters to the Potentates of Mounster, exhorting them to rebell, that the force of England at once might bee dismem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred.

                     <p>Rather of custome and dutyfull humility,<note place="margin">The oration of James Stani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurst Speaker of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> then for doubt of your honourable disposition, (so well knowne to us all, and to every of us in private, that it little needeth my praise) we are to request your Lordship in the behalfe of our selves, and our countryes, whom we represent in this Parliament, to accept our service and endeavour in driving these conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where by to the uttermost of our skill we have intended without injury, the Crowne to enrich, treasons to chastise, to better the state, traffique to further, learning to cherish, and in briefe, to maintaine with our best advice those benefits, which the Prince hath inferred upon this Realme by you, and you with your sword and wisedome have performed. An ordinary suite it is, in the end of such assemblies to crave exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions of law, for it sufficeth not, to keepe a statute <hi>tanquam inclusum in tabulis,</hi> as a thing shut up in parchment rolles, but law must speake and walke abroad, to the comfort and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoofe of good subjects: Otherwise, vve shall resemble the folly of him, that once in every houre saluted his gold, never using it, but onely bad it lye still and couch. Of the necessity thereof, I cannot say so much as your Lordship conceiveth,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18659:75"/>
and I desire not to discourse a matter generally felt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed. In particular the zeale which I have to the reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Realme, and to breede in the rudest of our people, resolute English hearts, moveth me to pray your Lordships helping hand for the practise, namely of one statute which is for the erecting of Grammer Schooles, within every diocesse, the stipends to be levied in such proportion, as in the late act hath beene devised, whereunto the royall assent is already granted, and yet the point in no forwardnes, nor in none is like to be, except by some good meanes, the onset be given &amp; freshly followed, surely might one generation sippe a little of this liquor, and so bee induced to long for more, both our country men that live obeysant, would ensue with a courage the fruites of peace, whereby good learning is supported, and our unquiet neighbours would finde such sweetenesse in the taste thereof, as it should bee a ready way to reclaime them. In mine experience, who have not yet seene much more then forty yeares, I am able to say that our Realme is at this day an halfe deale more civill then it was, since noble men and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull, with others of ability, have used to send their sonnes into England to the Law, to Vniversities, or to Schooles. Now when the same Schooles shall bee brought home to their doores, that all that will may repaire unto them, I doubt not, considering the numbers brought up beyond the Seas, and the good already done in those few places, where lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is professed, but this addition discreetly made, will fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster a young frye, likely to prove good members of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth, and desirous to traine their children the same way. Neither were it a small helpe to the assurance of the Crowne of England, when Babes from their Craddles should be inured under learned Schoole-masters, with a pure English tongue, habite, fashion, discipline; and in time utterly forget the affinity of their unbroken borderers, who possibly might be wonne by this example, or at the least wise loose the opportunity, which novv they have, to infect others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And seeing our hap is not yet, to plant an Vniversity here at home, which attempt can never bee remembred without many
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:18659:75"/>
thankes to your good Lordship for your bountifull offer, me seemeth it is the more expedient to enter so farre forth as our commission reacheth, and to hope for the rest: I have said e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, especially to a learned governour, to whom an inck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling were sufficient in such a plausible and needfull motion. It resteth that wee pray your Lordship to folde up whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver squarings or diversities of Iudgements, wise men have heere uttered in our often meetings, and by the sequele of all our doings to measure the good meaning of every severall person.</p>
                     <p>When the Speaker had done, the Deputy having a rich and plentifull kinde of utterance, meere naturall, but not without judgement, answered at length, as he that knew no end of his good, the points whereof, as I can remember, were these.</p>
                     <p>In good faith, M. Speaker, I cannot lesse doe, but recorde and testifie the readines, travaile and good service of you all,<note place="margin">The Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties answer.</note> and namely of your selfe, who in the whole course of this Parliament, &amp; now lastly in this charitable request for tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning your youth, have confirmed the opinion which my selfe and the generall voyce long since retained of your rare ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, devotion, wisedome, learning, and modestie, so as the case cannot be misdoubted that is preferred by such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, the substance whereof toucheth you my Lords spirituall and temporall, &amp; you the knights and worshipfull of every Shire, to you belongeth the quickening of this godly statute, which heere againe I recommend unto you, &amp; will not let to enquire after your diligence therein from time to time, &amp; the most effectuall order that may be for this purpose, shall assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly be taken in place convenient. Shew your selves forvvard and franke in advancing the honour, wealth, ease and credit of your countryes, envy not to your posterity the same path that your selves have troden, and namely you that flourish at this day in the light &amp; eye of your co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealth. Had your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions matched with mine, concerning the Vniversity which M. Speaker remembreth, no doubt the name and reputation thereof would have bin a spurre to these erections, as nurses
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:18659:76"/>
for babes to suck in, till they might repaire thither to be wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: But I trust your consents therein are only suspended for a time, and that so much good labour shall not be utterly lost and frustrate: What though certaine imperfections cannot as yet be salved? What though the summe arise not to make a muster of Colledges at the first day? What though the place be not also commodious? What though other circumstances inferre a feeble and rawe foundation? These are indeede ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of the multitude, whose backewardnesse bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth an unnecessary stoppe in this our purpose. But your wisedomes can easily consider that time must ripen a weake beginning, that other Vniversities began with lesse, that all experience telleth us so, shall wee be so curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or so testy that nothing will please us, but all in all, all absolute, all excellent, all furnished, all beautified, all forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the prime and infancie thereof. I remember a tale of <hi>Apuleius</hi> asse, who being indifferently placed betweene two bottles of haye, because he could not reach them both at once, forbare them both. Let us not so doe, but content our selves by little and little to bee fedde as the case requireth. The rest of your Bills debated and passed by your wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes in this Parliament, I must confesse, they are as you say, beneficiall to the Queene my Mistris, and to her Crowne, but how? Verily as the Husband-man soweth his seede, and reapeth much more then he layde downe, so whatsoever this benefite amounteth unto, it returneth to your selves in a circle, heere it groweth, heere it is eaten, heere it multiplyeth, heere it is spent, they have their due, the Prince is bettered, you are qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted, Iustice executed, malefactours terrifyed. Were they never so deare collopps of your owne flesh and bloud, I see not how you could either have coloured their offence, or qualifyed their punishment, the one so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, that it cannot be dissembled, the other so ordinary, that course of law prescribeth it. Therefore as you have well done, so you have done but your duties, allowed an inch to receive an ell, abridged your owne foes, avenged your own
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:18659:76"/>
Injuryes, condemned your owne oppressors. And yet this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being on your parts, so cheerefully and painfully, so loving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and advisedly performed, deserveth great thankes, and shall finde it too, If I bee the man, either in office able to consider you, or out of office in place to friend you. I am to depart in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to England shortly, lay your heads together, and article the points, whereby this Realme may be furthered, use mee ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a mouth to speake for you, or an eye to direct you, or as a hand to under-prop you, <hi>aut consilio, aut auxilio.</hi> Besides, the generall care vvhich I ought to have for you all, as your governour, and yoked together under one obedience, English blouds, and English hearts, I am linked to you as to my conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall acquaintance these many yeares, hither I came in my spring, heere I have spent my summer, I returne in the fall of the leafe, now is the time, intimate your defects in demaunds, or what else soever may content you, and see whether I will tender your common-wealth. I meane not the pretended common-wealth, seditiously promoted in <hi>Tom Loodles</hi> ryme, but some good and substantiall matter worth the hearing, which upright and equall men will indeede e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme. As for his complaint of Cesse and Imposition, it savoureth either hatefull malice, or childish folly, malice if he would decay the garrison that preserveth the Realme, folly if he thinke the Realme can be preserved vvithout a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, vvherin I will shew you my fancie by the vvay, perhaps out of all order, but I pray beare vvith mee, I take matters as they come next to hand, I can not skill of vvritten tales. Many a good-fellovv talkes of <hi>Robin Hoode,</hi> that never drevv in his Bovv, and many an idle head is full of Proclamations, and conceiveth certaine farre fetches, able in his vveening to vvield a Realme. But let me see vvhich of them all can justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that Ireland may spare the Army they kicke so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst. Are your enemyes more tractable then they have beene? Are they fevver? Are you by your selves of force to match them? If you bee, then vvere England starke madde, to disburse tvventie or thirtie thousand pounds a yeare, for none other purpose but to vexe and grieve you:
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:18659:77"/>
that were like the husband who gelded himselfe to anger his wife. You must not thinke wee love you so evill, nay rather thinke truely wee tender your quietnesse and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as a nation derived from our auncestours, ingraffed and incorporate into one body with us, disturbed with a sort of barbarous people, odious to God and man, that lappe your bloud as greedily as ours. The abuse of souldiours, their horse, boyes, and harlots, the Legerdemaine of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, chequerelles, the purloyning of Cessors &amp; Constables, the number of freedomes holding onely by <hi>concordatum,</hi> the annoyance and hurt which the poore farmer endureth, as I know them to be intollerable, so I know them to be redres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with the first detection, whose complaint hath not been heard? whose enormity vvinked at? what can you aske more? would you have souldiours nothing insolent, nothing sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, nothing greedy, no quarrellers? so wish I, but scarce hope for it, vvould you hazard a misery certaine, extreame, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable, to avoyde a trouble casuall, transitory, and remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse? so vvould not I, if you can prove a garrison needlesse, I undertake to ease you thereof, If you neede it, they must bee fedde, finde another vvay then this, to provide for them vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, that carryeth asmuch readinesse to service, and more contentation to your selves, and I assure you mine assistance to set it forvvard. But the Brokers of this libell are vvont to reason, Why should not vvee live vvithout an Army as vvell as in England? Why cannot our Noble-men of might in every border, our tenants and servaunts vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Irish next them, as vvell as the Northerne Lordes and Inhabitants of Riddesdale and Tiddesdale, and those about the Scottish banke resist the Scotts, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and pilfering as fast as our enemyes. Very good, vvhat saye they then to Fraunce, vvhich is no vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser governed then England, and hath an Armye. Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly notvvithstanding as vvell ordered as Fraunce vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Army? Spaine asvvell as either of them both, and continually keepes an Armye? I tell you, these are daungerous and hollovve kindes of Arguments,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:18659:77"/>
which are deduced <hi>ab exemplo,</hi> by example of other Realmes. Many subtile diversities, many varieties of circumstance, many exceptions alter the case, and make it utterly desperate. Touching Scotland it is well knowne, they were never the men whom England neede to feare: They are but a corner cut out, and easily tamed when they waxe outragious. Your foes lie in the bosome of your Countryes; more in number, richer of ground, desperate theeves, ever at an inch, unpossible to be severed from you without any fence, beside your owne valiantnes, and the helpe of our Souldiours. England is quiet within it selfe, thoroughly peopled on that side of Scotland, which most requireth it, guarded with an army, otherwise the Lords and Gentlemen, and lusty Yeoman, that dwell on a row are ready to maister their private vagaries. From all forraine invasions walled with the wide Ocean. Were there such a Sea betwixt you and the Irish, or were they shut up in an odde end of the land, or had they no such opportunityes of bogges and woods as they have, or were they Lords of the lesser part of Ireland, or were they severed into handfuls, not able to annoy whole towneships and Baronies as they doe, the comparison were somewhat like, but alacke it fareth not so with you, you are beset round, your townes be feeble, the land empty, the commons bare, every county by it selfe cannot save it selfe. Take away the terrour and feare of our Bande, which increaseth your strength, many an Irish Lord would be set agog that novv is full lovvly, and holdeth in his hornes, and the open enemy vvould scovvre your quarters that novv dares not venture lest he pay for his passage. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me the effect of an Army vvrought in these fevv yeares, for doubt vvhereof you are nothing so oft nor so lamentably pelted at, as your auncestors vvere, vvhich of them durst be stored vvith coyne, knovving the rebells teeth vvatered there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, and himselfe not able to hold him out? vvhich of them had leisure to build, to lye soft and vvarme, to take his ease in his ovvne home? vvhich of them vvere plated, or jevvelled, or attyred themselves, their vivves and children sumptuously, after their calling as you doe now? If your bagges bee full
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:18659:78"/>
vvhere theirs were lancke, if you dwell neatly where they dwelled homely, if you sleep on featherbeds where they slept on couches, if you be sumptuous where they vvere skant, you have the more cause to honour that Scepter, that so directeth you, and to love the warrant that procureth you this quietnes, the mother of all your wealth and prosperity.</p>
                     <p>Therefore to conclude where I began, weigh well the sicke and wounded parts of your common wealth, cure the roote, regard the foundation, the principall pillars, the sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer posts, the stone walles, as for the roofe and the tyles, if yee repaire them onely, and suffer the ground worke to perish, a tempest of weather, a flovve will shake your building. Of some such good and substantiall reformation I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise you friendly to consult, and you shall finde me as willing to preferre the generall welfare of you all, as I have beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to benefit every singular person of you, that hath in any lawfull suite attempted me.</p>
                     <p>¶ These last words gave <hi>Sidney</hi> to the Realme, as it were for a farewell, and thenceforvvards looked for Sir <hi>VVilliam Fitz VVilliams</hi> his brother in law, a politicke and stout gentleman, now Lord Iustice, and for Sir <hi>Iohn Perrot</hi> Lord president of Mounster, to be settled there, before his departure.

                  <p>But to let these fables passe: The next plantation after <hi>Bartholanus</hi> (as it is recorded amongst the collections of Irish antiquities) is this in effect, that <hi>Magog</hi> the sonne of <hi>Iaphet</hi> planted Colonies in <hi>Scythia</hi> neere the river of <hi>Tanais,</hi> from whence about the yeere of the world two thousand three hundred and seventeene,<note place="margin">

In the end the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants prevailing, chased them out of the land, so that they retired into Scythia, and some to Greece. This was about the yeere after the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 2333, from which time the Giants kept possession of the land without forraigne invasion for many yeeres, but yet in all that space their mindes not being set upon any goodnesse, but altogether upon mischiefe, they made no good lawes, framed no common wealth, they obeyed no Magistrate, but fell at variance amongst themselues, measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring all things by might, and seditiously vexed each other.</p>
                  <p>In the yeere of the world 2416, and after the universall flood 750 yeeres (as the Scottish History declareth) one <hi>Gathelus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Nealus</hi> a Grecian,<note place="margin">Arrivall of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelus</hi> the Greek.</note> upon displeasure for sundry rodes made into Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia and Achaia, being exiled and banished his countrey, with a great number of his adherents and complices, went into Aegypt in the dayes of <hi>Moses,</hi> where he found favour in the sight of King <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> insomuch that he married with <hi>Scota</hi> his daughter, continued there about 93 yeeres, and multiplied exceedingly. <hi>Iohannes Major Scotus</hi> calleth the verity of this History in question, <hi>de hac prima profectione de Graecia &amp; Aegypto figmentum reor: I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> (saith hee) <hi>that this first going out of Greece and Aegypt is but fayned</hi>: yet let us goe forward. When <hi>Gathelus</hi> understood that the land was shortly for the wickednesse of the people to suffer great plagues, he prepared a fleet, shipped Grecians and Aegyptians, hoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up saile, and came upon the coast of Numidia, now called Barbary, thence they were put back, to sea they went, and came to the coast of Spaine now called Portingall (as they say) since that time of him called Port-gathell. The inhabitants of the place resisted them, gave them a sore battell, and in the end after parlie, <hi>Gathelus</hi> was intreated, and by them directed to take his voyage into Galitia, which eftsoones he did. There in a short time they waxed so populous, that the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey could not sustaine them: whereupon <hi>Gathelus</hi> called a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, and being resolved what to doe, tooke a great number of them with him to sea, and arrived in Ireland, and there grew into such esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation with the barbarous people, that for knowledge especially in all languages (having travelled many Countreys, as is afore mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) he was highly honoured. For he not only enriched and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Irish tongue, but also, as is said, taught them letters, sought up their antiquities, and trained their youth in warlike exercises, after the manner of the Grecians and Aegyptians from whence he descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

The Scottish Historiographers say, it was 750 yeeres after the flood. <hi>Thomas Walsingham</hi> Monke of S. Albons, writeth it was 1000 yeeres and odde after the delivery of the children of Israel out of Aegypt (which must be <hi>anno mundi</hi> 3455, to wit, one 1000 yeeres after the former computation) calling him a noble man of Scythia whom the Aegyptians banished out of Aegypt. <hi>Iohn Harding,</hi> a great Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (that knew best in his time the state of Scotland) delivereth, that <hi>Gathelus</hi> and <hi>Scota</hi> came to these parts after the birth of Christ, <hi>in anno</hi> 75. This I give as a caveat, referring unto the discreet reader the dissonance that I finde in the observation of times, to bee considered of, promising to lay downe faithfully euery thing as I finde the same, as shall appeare in that which followeth. And now to the history where we left. It is said that this <hi>Gathelus</hi> of his wife <hi>Scota</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that his followers Grecians and Aegyptians should be called <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> that is, <hi>Scottishmen.</hi> And <hi>Hector Boëtius</hi> in the History of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land sticketh not to write, that upon his marriage with <hi>Scota,</hi> the foresaid commandement was published, and that his followers in Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, Barbary, Portingall, Galitia, and over Spaine, were called <hi>Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti.</hi> But how true that is, it may appeare by the Roman Histories (which haue noted the accidents of those times) in all which there is no mention of the Scots before the time of <hi>Constantius</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour (which was about the yeere of Christ 310 who lyeth buried at York, and was father to <hi>Constantine</hi> the great.</p>

And touching the truth of the History of <hi>Gathelus</hi> and <hi>Scota,</hi> hee saith; <hi>To the end the worthinesse of so great a mariage delivered unto the posterity should florish, all these Grecians call themselues Scots; and Ireland where they first seated themselues, Scotiam. But all this as a vaine fable George Buchanan, and before him Humfrey Lloide have quite reiected, and if Hector Boëtius bee not the chiefe forger of this hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, or rather vaine fable, yet he hath besprinckled (after his manner) the whole discourse with lies. With great ambition hath that silly wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter labored to advance the glory of his nation, in the which endeauour, hee hath little regarded the honour of his Country and his owne credit. For he hath purchased this amongst the learned, that where as he would seeme to write all for the loue of the truth, they will beleeue in a manner nothing to be true which he wrote: For to what purpose should he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the posterity the acts of his ancestors with such maiesty of words, that they have quailed the Spaniard; vanquished the Irish with their only austere countenance, triumphed as often as pleased themselves over the bordering Britaines; where they pitched foot, subiected all as furious victors; that thou maist think the Scottish not so much to have invaded forraigne Countryes, as to have removed to their proper pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions. These fabulous dreames happely may move admiration to some old wives, applause to some Abderas, and laughter to the discreete rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The Scotish had as other nations tofore (though now famous) base beginning, dusked and obscured with some barbarous rudenesse, and this had beene more discretion to confesse, then to vaunt or crake among the ignorant, with boast of their fained doings.</hi> Thus farre <hi>Stani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurst:</hi>

                  <p>In the antiquities of Ireland it is generally receiued that <hi>Gathelus</hi> (of whom I spake before) gave the Irishmen the language, which of him they call <hi>Gaodhealgh</hi> in British <hi>Gwidhealaec,</hi> that is, a language compounded of many tongues, and so it may well be; for by reason of his great trauell he had skill in many tongues.

In the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, <hi>Conan</hi> the sonne of <hi>Iago</hi> Prince of Wales married with <hi>Ranulph</hi> daughter of <hi>Alfred</hi> King of Dublin, <hi>anno</hi> 1041. In the time of <hi>William Rufus, Arnulph</hi> Earle of Pembroke married with the daughter of <hi>Marogh</hi> King of Ireland <hi>anno</hi> 1101; at the same time <hi>Magnus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Herald</hi> married with another daughter of the said King. In the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the first and King <hi>Steuen</hi> lived <hi>Grif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fith ap Conan</hi> Prince of Wales, that was wont to brag of three things, that his mother was an Irishwoman, his grandmother an Irishwo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and that hee himselfe was borne, and of a child brought vp in Ireland. In the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the second. <hi>Biryd</hi> the sonne of <hi>Owen Gwyneth</hi> Prince of Wales, being Lord of Cloghran in Ireland, begat his sonne <hi>Howel</hi> upon an Irish Gentlewoman. In the same Kings raigne <hi>Richard Strangbow</hi> Earle of Pembroke, married with <hi>Eva</hi> the daughter of <hi>Dermotte Mac Morrogh</hi> King of Leinster. Thirdly, when there was any trouble in Ireland, they fled to Wales; when they had any warres or rebellion there, they came for refuge and aide into Ireland: hereof came the shaking of hands, <hi>Brother Brannagh, Brother Erinagh.</hi> In the life of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, it is written, that when <hi>Othobon</hi> the Popes Legate came to Oxford, and soiourned at Osney Abbey, among other schollers, some for one cause, some for another, that were there, a poore Irish scholler (<hi>Matthew Paris</hi> calleth him <hi>Capellanum Hibernensem</hi>) drew neere unto the kitchin dresser, and praid for some releefe; the cook took a ladell full of hot liquor and threw it in his face; a Welch scholler standing by tooke his bow, and shot the cook through with an arrow (<hi>Stow</hi> writeth that the cook was the Legates brother) the hurly burly was great, the schollers came together in armes (and as it is said, one <hi>Odo</hi> of Kilkenny was their ensigne bearer) the Cardinals men were well beaten, the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall himselfe to save his life fled secretly at a posterne gate to the King, made a grievous complaint, and craved the aide of armed men to fetch off his men, and thereof arose great troubles; but to proceed. <hi>Dermotte Mac Morogh</hi> King of Leinster, being banished out of his country, had aide out of Wales. <hi>Conan</hi> the sonne of <hi>Iago, Griffith ap Conan, Rees ap Tewder, Owen</hi> the sonne of <hi>Cadogan, Kadwalader</hi> the sonne of <hi>Griffith ap Conan, Marlgon ap David,</hi> Princes of Wales; <hi>Algar</hi> Earle of Chester, <hi>Arnulph</hi> Earle of Pembroke, <hi>Magnus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Herald, William de Bruse</hi> Lord of Breknock, with his wife and children, in extremity, tooke Ireland for their refuge, where they found favor and kindnesse to their own hearts desire, as in the British Chronicles published by <hi>Caradoc</hi> of Sancarban, <hi>Cambrensis, Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey Lloid,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Powel,</hi> doth more plainly appeare. These two
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18659:84"/>
nations conversed much one with another; Sir <hi>Tristram</hi> one of the Knights of the round Table, came to Ireland. <hi>Morogh</hi> brother to the King of Ireland (whom <hi>Caxton</hi> calleth <hi>Morhaus</hi>) was one of King <hi>Arthurs</hi> Knights. <hi>Merlin</hi> the Welch Prophet came twice to Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and in Ofaby there is a Chappell bearing his name: the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of his first comming was this. There was a noble man of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land which had a suit unto the King of England, with whom <hi>Merlin</hi> was great, to whom he said, <hi>Merlin,</hi> if thou wilt effect my sute, come to Ireland, and I will give thee as much land as thou shalt see round about thee: it was done; after his arrivall, <hi>Merlin</hi> demanded his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, the noble man put him into a cellar, where was a grate, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a bawne, with an high wall, looke out (saith the Irish man) the Welch Prophet could not see a quoits cast from him, and thus was he deceived, having left his spirit of prophecy at home. But to our purpose.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the first conquerors in <hi>Henry</hi> the seconds times, that brake the ice into this land, were Welch men, whose names and seates to this day are fresh in memory. <hi>Rees ap Tewder</hi> Prince of Southwales had a daughter called <hi>Nesta,</hi> who by King <hi>Henry</hi> the first had issue, <hi>Henry,</hi> and he had issue <hi>Meiler Fitz Henry</hi> and <hi>Robart</hi>; she was afterwards married to <hi>Stephan,</hi> and he had issue, <hi>Robart Fitz Stephan,</hi> and his issue were <hi>Radulph</hi> and <hi>Mereduk</hi>; shee had a third husband, <hi>Giraldus</hi> Steward of Pembroke, whose mother was <hi>Gladys</hi> the daughter of <hi>Rywall ap Conyn,</hi> this <hi>Girald</hi> had issue by her, <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice Fitz Gerald, William Fitz Gerald,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> Bishop of Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via, now called Saint Davids: <hi>Maurice Fitz Gerald</hi> had issue, <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, Girald, Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Nesta</hi> a daughter, wife to <hi>Harvey de Monte Marisco; William Fitz Gerald</hi> had issue (by <hi>Ellen</hi> sister to Earle <hi>Richard Strongbow) Reimund</hi> and <hi>Griffin,</hi> of these descend all the <hi>Geraldins</hi> in Ireland. A neece (a sister say others) of <hi>Robart Fitz Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans</hi> and <hi>Maurice Fitz Gerald</hi> married with one <hi>Barry,</hi> and hee by her had issue, <hi>Robart Barry, Philip Barry, Walter Barry,</hi> and <hi>Girald Barry</hi> (otherwise called <hi>Giraldus Cambrensis</hi> the great Antiquary) of these descend all the <hi>Barries</hi> in Ireland. There came with them and after them out of Wales, the <hi>Prendergastes, Welches, Whites, Goughes,</hi> and <hi>Williams,</hi> now called <hi>Mac William</hi> of the North.</p>
                  <p>The Irish Chroniclers, as <hi>David Curren, Nicolas Maguize</hi> (both som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Bishop of Leighlin) and others, call them Brittones, Wallones, and Wallenses. It is a name the Saxons gave them; though they were the true natives of Britaine, yet they called them Welshmen, that is,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Camb. descrip. Brit. cap.</hi> 7.</note> strangers, as more at large is to bee seen in <hi>Cambrensis.</hi> These gave Welsh names to places, which continue to this day; in the Dioces of Leighlin there is a town called <hi>villa Wallicoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> the town of Welsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. <hi>Carreg</hi> &amp; <hi>Craig</hi> in the British or Welsh tongue is a ston, or rock, and of the Britaines, <hi>Carregfergus, Carreggmont-Griffin, Carregg in
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18659:84"/>
Shurie, Carriggwaspani,</hi> and <hi>Craigwading</hi> have their names. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>Llis</hi> in British is a Court or Palace, of that in Ireland you have <hi>Lismore, Lisfenyn, Lislofty, Lismakery. Glan</hi> and <hi>Glyn</hi> are British words, of them have you <hi>Glangibbon, Glandeboy, Glan Reynald, Glyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burry, Glyndelory, Glynmolowra, &amp;c. Inis</hi> an Iland, is British and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, of which kind are <hi>Inissircan, Inisshoven, Inisdiok, Inissuag, Inis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corthie,</hi> and the like. <hi>Rath</hi> a moat or round trench (whereof there are many in Ireland made by the Danes) if <hi>Beda</hi> had not said that it was a Saxon word, I would have said it had been British, and how many names of places are compounded with it in Ireland, were too long to rehearse. I will here give <hi>Stanihurst</hi> leave to conclude, <hi>Omnes insulae locos et lucos Wallici nominis gloria implevit; the renowne of the Welsh name</hi> (saith he) <hi>hath filled all the wayes and woods of the Iland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The British words among them are infinite, the which, as I think, the Irish have taken hold of, and have caused to vary little from their speech, for example.</p>

                  <p>And thus much of the Irish language occasioned by the history of <hi>Gathelus</hi> and <hi>Scota</hi>; now to the history, from whence I feare mee I have too long digressed. The hard successe of <hi>Nemedus</hi> before spoken of, and the departure of <hi>Gathelus</hi> (as hath beene said) to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>east Ilands, and North parts of Britaine, now called Scotland, moved five brethren, the sonnes of one <hi>Dela</hi> of the posterity of <hi>Nemedus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing valiant men, and skilfull in the Art of Navigation, to make ready a great fleet, and to attempt the conquest of this Iland. These were, as I presently said, of the posterity of <hi>Nemedus,</hi> and were named, <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius, Gennadius, Sagandus, Rutheranius</hi> or <hi>Rutheragus,</hi> and <hi>Slanius,</hi> of whom <hi>Slane</hi> hath the denomination; when they had made prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,<note place="margin">Five sonnes of <hi>Dela</hi> arrive in Ireland, <hi>anno mundi</hi> 2535.</note> assembled forces, and set all in a readinesse, they hoised up saile, and in short time arrived in Ireland, about the yeere of the world 2535.</p>
                  <p>After their arrivall, and view had of the land, they found the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issance of the Chamesite Giants sore weakned through their owne civill dissention, so that with more ease then they looked for, they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18659:85"/>
their purpose, wanne the whole country, utterly destroyed and rooted out that wicked generation (enemies to God and man) but spared as many as they found of <hi>Iaphets</hi> line, divided the Iland into five parts, and in each of them they severally reigned.<note place="margin">First division of Ireland.</note> This was the first division of Ireland, the discourse whereof I will referre to another place. Furthermore for the satisfaction of all parties, and perfect league to be had among these brethren, and their posterity, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to fix a meare stone in the middle point of Ireland, to the which each of their kingdomes should reach, so as they might in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality partake of the commodities found in that Iland. Of these al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so it is said, that they invented the distribution of Shires into Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds, every Cantred or Barony to containe one hundred townships: but of this in another place. When they had for a certaine space sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselves (say the Irish Antiquaries) and found warmth and wealth about them, every one began to looke big, and grow ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, so that in processe of time, desire of Soverainty set the five bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren at variance, which in the end tended to their destruction. In this civill dissention it is written, that <hi>Slanius</hi> the yongest through the aid of some old inhabitants, got the upper hand, brought his foure brethren to a low estate, attributed unto himselfe the title of supreme honour over them, and encroched round about the middle stone and fixed meare aforesaid, for the space of certaine miles; which plot in time, obtained the priviledge and name of one entire plot, or part, and maketh up the number of five parts, into the which Ireland is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly divided, and is called <hi>Meth,</hi> in Latine <hi>Media,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Meth</hi> why so called.</note> and of some <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> taking that name (as some haue guessed) for that in respect of the other parts, it contained but the moity of Cantreds, that is, six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene, where each of the other contained thirty and two; or else for that it lieth in the midst of the land.</p>
                  <p>These encrochments <hi>Slanius</hi> annexed to his inheritance and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, which Monarchy continued thus, the space of thirty yeeres, and then <hi>Slanius</hi> departed this life, and was buried in a mountaine of <hi>Meth,</hi> that beareth hitherto the name after him. After his decease the Princes that before were subiect unto him, began to gather heart, sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mached the matter, and denied their obedience to his successour: whereupon ensued continuall warre amongst them, and especially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the land of <hi>Meth,</hi> which strife of long time could not bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased, yet in the space of thirty yeeres aforesaid, of these brethren and their successors there were nine Kings. In the neck of all these mischiefes and hurly burlies (say the Irish antiquities) there came a fleet of Scythians upon the coast, landed their men in Ireland, made claime to the land,<note place="margin">Invasion of Scythians.</note> by a title of right which they pretended from their forefather <hi>Nemedus</hi> (of whom mention is made before) so that by partaking with the one side and the other, all was in an uproare, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vock was made on each side with fire and sword in most miserable
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18659:86"/>
manner. They spent themselves in pursuing one another with such outrage, that they cared not what nation, or what souldier they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to their aid, to hold up, or beat downe a side. Both the one and the other sent for aid into the Ilands now called England and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Orchades, Hebrides, &amp;c. and acquainted forrainers with their state so farre, that they could never after be rid of them, to wit, the Britaines, till in the end they yeelded unto them the upper hand, as by conquests, in processe of the history, shall appeare. Note (gentle reader) how that hitherto,<note place="margin">

The second company of this combination came to Lambay, landed their men at the Follesse of Skerries, set their men in battaile array, and marched to a place now called Cnoc-nagean, that is the hill of dead mens heads, where <hi>Dermotte Lamhdhearg</hi> King of Leinster met them, fought a cruell battaile with equall fortune for the space of foure daies;<note place="margin">A strange bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile if it be true.</note> the Irish by reason of the spoile and victory got at the former battaile, were mightily encouraged, and also the milke and fresh meate which the country yeelded them, and the strangers wanted, made them the more able to fight; to be short, the strangers were overthrowne, and thirty sixe thousand of them slaine, whose Armes furnished Ireland throughly to encounter with the rest of the combination.</p>
                  <p>The third company came to Fentra in Mounster, where the forces of Ireland being gathered together, kept them from landing the space of seven dayes, with the slaughter of many on both sides, so that the sea-shore at sundry times was died redde with the bloud of the slaine karkasses, untill that one <hi>Gillemore,</hi> sonne to the King of Thomond,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gillemore</hi> of Thomond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volteth.</note> (being male-content for that he was remoued from the voward of the battaile to the rere) revolted, and by night stole to the enemie, and directed them where they should safely land their men, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly came to passe, so that the Irish knew it not untill the strangers had set their owne shippes on fire: hee withall brought the invaders to such advantage of ground, that they refreshed themselues for ten dayes without any annoyance from the Irish, and afterward when they came to skirmish, did himselfe divers times fight valiantly, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruing his hands in the bloud of his owne naturall countrimen. At last it fell out after some bickering, that hee called for water to wash his hands that were all full of the bloud of his countrymen, which was left stand after he had therein washed, and soone after calling for a cup of wine, was answered that there stood a bowle of wine upon the table; he forgetting that he had formerly washed therein, dranke
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18659:92"/>
it up, insomuch, that the standers by said; <hi>What fellow is this, more like a brute beast then a man, that drinketh his owne bloud, and eateth his owne flesh? Gillemore</hi> hearing this, tooke it to heart, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding dissembling his griefe and anger,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Shortly after, the day of battaile was appointed, where the stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were overthrowne,<note place="margin">The battaile of Fentra.</note> and (as they say) seven score thousand men slaine. The Irish had supplies and extraordinary meanes at home, the strangers could not come by it; the Irish plaid with them at all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, the woods and the bogs defended them as occasion ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. This battaile with the preambles and circumstances, continued one whole yeere, the strangers had no shipping to flee unto for suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, the ground was unknowne unto them, their lodging and fare was cold, hard, and scant, so as their hardinesse could not hold out, their end was lamentable, and the honour was bequeathed to the Irish nation. The Princes of Ireland having thus with great successe foiled their enemies, delivered their people from utter overthrow, and quieted the land, rested themselves a while. Afterward, partly for recompence of good service, and partly for safegard of the land, appointed the Danes (whom they had formerly hired, who also un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that time had served them truely) over the whole land to prevent forraigne invasion, forewarned by the field of Fentra and the former attempts; these Commanders with their particular places of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, I thought good to impart to the courteous reader.</p>

                  <p>In the time of <hi>Karbre Lifeacher,</hi> Monarch of Ireland, the Danish Captaines with their bands and garrisons,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Karbre Lifea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi> Monarch of Ireland.</note> waxed insolent and outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, they weighed not what Prince or people said, they grew strong and rich, not caring what they did: they brought vp fond cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes of their owne devising, oppressing the people, and disdaining the gentle admonitions of the Kings and Nobilitie of the land. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themselves they decreed, that no Maid should marry without their license, that none should hunt the Hare, Otter, Foxe, Wolfe, Marterne or Deare,<note place="margin">The insolent devices of the Danes.</note> but should pay them what they pleased to rate it at, and that none should use any other pastime without their privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. The Kings and Nobilitie of the land called a Parliament, ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to reforme these abuses, charging them to surcease from their
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18659:93"/>
outrages, or to leave the land. The Danes answered, that they came in with the sword, held by the sword, and with the sword they would be driven away. The day of battaile was appointed to be fought at Amaghery Ongallin, now called Margallin in Westmeath, though the field be called Ardkagh, which is by interpretation, a set field.</p>
                  <p>The Danes sent to Denmarke, intimating their griefe and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble estate, craving aide of the King, and that he would be pleased to send his sonne to be their Generall, who (according to their request) shortly after landed with tenne thousand stalworth souldiers (so the old phrase runneth) and they comming together, made up twenty and eight thousand, and seven hundred. The Kings of Ireland with their forces were threescore and five thousand.<note place="margin">Forces of the Irish and Danes.</note> The Danes or Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wegians being valiant and venterous, hastened to the battaile at the day appointed. The Kings in like sort with their forces hearing that their enemies approched, set themselves in battaile array, and came to a place where they all kissed the ground, readie to dye one with another, and gave (after their manner) such a crie, as if heauen and earth met together, and therewith somewhat amazed their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,<note place="margin">Garrestowne. The marshal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Danes at the battaile of Ardkath.</note> so that the place to this day is called Balle-Nangartha, in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish, Garrestowne.</p>
                  <p>The strangers placed themselves on the South-west side of the hill, that the forces of the Kings being on the other side, somewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath them, might not easilie discrie their Armie; they appointed their worst men for their Rereward, that seeing the Voward valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encountring and prevailing, they might thereby be the more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged. They placed their rascals on their jades, nagges and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring garrons, on the top of an hill, where at this day is a little Mote in remembrance thereof, giuing them in charge, that when the forces of the land espied them, and drew neere, they should retire to the maine battaile for refuge and succour; they hoped by these meanes, that the Kings when they saw so great a company flee, would breake their order and array to pursue them, and so lay themselves open to utter ouerthrow; and then was their intent to have made the King of Denmarkes sonne, King of the land, and to have enioyed the Realme to them and their posteritie for euer.</p>
                  <p>The Kings of Ireland being seven in number, tracing a while on the top of an hill (which therefore was called after that,<note place="margin">Hol-trase. Order of the Kings of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land at the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> field of Ard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kath.</note> the hill of Trase, now Hol-trase) divided themselves into two battailes. <hi>Gillemore, O Connor Dunnes,</hi> sonne of <hi>Connaght</hi> (one that had stood out in rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion against the Kings untill that time) had in the Voward the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the light footmen, whereof they made least account; he ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to winne their favours,<note place="margin">

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18659:93"/>
ground, and turned him to the armie with this speech.</p>
                  <p>My friends and fellowes in Armes,<note place="margin">The King of Leinsters speech.</note> whose great valour hath been oft tryed; understand (I beseech you) the cause of this battaile. Whereas heretofore we have sought out these, and hired them in our warres for our defence and good of our country, against our forraine enemies, to be at our service and command, they have committed all manner of outrage against vs, and extortion upon the people of this land; they abused our wives, ravished our widowes, defloured our daughters and maidens; their meat, their drinke, their bedding, will not content them, but they must have money for eating, drinking and sleeping. Where they should have beene our true and dutifull serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, they disdained the Princes of the land, and made the people their villaines. By maintaining of them, wee made our country men idle and unapt for the warres, by inriching of them we have begge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red our selves, and now see the villany of these verlates, our provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, our furniture, our Armes, and forces of our native soile, they bend against us, and not onely this, but they have drawn to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent aide, afresh, both Danes and Norwegians. Wherefore plucke up your hearts, quitte your selues like men, our cause is good, wee fight for our selves, our wives and children, and the libertie of our country; if we lose, we are lost for euer, and our children become bondslaues, and our country subiect to these bloudy rascall strangers.</p>
                  <p>He had no sooner ended his speech, but they all kissed the ground, and gave a terrible shout, that the woods about them rang thereat. On the other side, one <hi>Osker Mac Oshen,</hi> experienced in the warres, and bold of speech, craved of the Danes and Norweyes libertie to speake, and began as followeth.</p>

We fought many a battaile for them, wee wanne them tributes, and procured them discharge of tributes, the which forraigne champions in combats had obtained of them, and now for recompence, they endevour eyther to banish us the land, or put us to the sword. Will yee understand what they are, surely a people that keepe no promise with us, therefore we doubt not but the better to speed: and excepting a few of their Princes and Gentlemen that are valiant men indeed, and daily exercised in feats of Armes, the rest are but pesants, poore and needy slaues, bare arst, bare legd, and bare footed, and of small strength. For Armes, they weare a skull, a

sword by their side hanging in a Wyth that compasseth their middle, and a Target; other some have darts; the best thing in them is, they are swift of foot, &amp; I hope we shal speedily have the experience of that when we see them run away. Their good meate &amp; best drink we took, and made them fast, their treasure we tooke to furnish us in apparell and Armes, and left them unfurnished and bare, their bedding wee had, and made them lye on the ground, their wives, widdowes and maides were at our command to keepe us warme in the night, and we gave them leave to lye among their swine.

                     <note place="margin">The battaile of Ardkath.</note>His words being ended, they marched forward with Pipes, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, and Trumpets sounding. Their chiefe armes were Skeynes, Speares, Darts, Slings, and Sparthes, (which we call Galloglas Axes:) they sent their boyes and varlets, as they had formerly determined, to the top of the hill. The King of Leinster that had the leading of the horsemen, no sooner espied them, but (contrary to the plot laid downe upon the hill of Trase) put spurres to his horse, and with a loud voyce said, follow me, they were straight upon their backes that fled, so that the Danes had no leisure to receive them for their safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, but were driven to kill their owne before, as the Irish did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde. Immediately came the light foot under the leading of <hi>Gille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,</hi> and together with the horse, charged the voward of the Danes, so that the rascals of the Danes, and the light footmen of the Irish were slaine, with the death and hurt of many a Dane. Then came the great battaile of the Kings of Ireland in rescue of the horse, with a great and terrible noise, and gave a stout charge upon the enemie (that kept the ground, I meane the side of the hill) and fiercely bare them downe to the bottome, where they fought a cruell battell with equall fortune, almost the whole day, untill the King of Denmarkes sonne was slaine by the King of Leinster,<note place="margin">

                     </note> whereupon the Danes fled, the Irish followed, and had the killing of them without resistance, till horse and man were weary, and the Danes in a manner all destroyed. Of the Irish were slaine (as I finde in the antiquities of the land) foure Kings, twenty five Kings sonnes, and of others, nineteene thousand, seven hundred and threescore, though others extenuate the matter. They say the horses went to their bellies in bloud, also the ayre with the stinke was infected, and thereof shortly after rose a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous plague, which cut off the wives, children, and servants of the Danes, and of many of the Irish that were slaine.</p>

<hi>Merlin</hi> came, and being advised, said as followeth. <q>Most Noble King, upon occasion offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I went lately into Ireland, and having ended my businesse, I was inquisitive of antiquities, and sight of monuments, where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things, being brought to a mountaine of Kildare, I saw so rare a sight, in so rude a country, as might bee seene; there was a round row of huge stones, the which none of this age had so framed, neither could be, unlesse Art had mastered the common skill of man; send for them, and set them vp as they are there cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and they will bee a monument whilst the world standeth.</q>
Hereat the King smiled and said; how shall we convey so great stones into Britaine, from so farre a countrey, and to what end? as though Britaine yeelded not as good stones to all purposes? <hi>Merlin</hi> replied, be not displeased O King, there is a hid mystery in those stones, they are medicinable, and as I was given to understand in Ireland, the Gyants of old dwelling in that land, procured them from the farthest

The Legend speaketh of a priviledge granted to that Church-yard, which <hi>I</hi> take to have beene brought in through the covetousnesse of the Priests: That what faithfull soever being penitent, shall bee buried there, shall not after this life, feele the torments of hell; as if every faithfull penitent Christian were not freed from hell, wheresoever he be buried. But let us proceed: <hi>Torpereus</hi> Bishop of Cloan his Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18659:106"/>
was the first man that was buried in that Church-yard. After this, <hi>Finbarry</hi> went to <hi>Calangus</hi> a reverend man, then Abbot of Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane, and concluded betweene themselves, that in the feare of God, they would both be buried in one place, and so indeed it fell out, for there <hi>Finbarry</hi> fell sicke, received the Sacrament at the hands of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>langus,</hi> ended his dayes, and was brought to the Church-yard of old Corke, and there interred; shortly after, followed <hi>Calangus,</hi> and there Bishop <hi>Torperus</hi> the first Bishop of Cloane, <hi>Finbarry</hi> the first Bishop of Corke, and <hi>Calangus</hi> the first Abbot of Cloane, keepe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the dust of the earth, waiting for the resurrection at the last day.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:18659:114"/>
who had one <hi>Dympna</hi> to his daughter, who secretly was baptized by one <hi>Gerebernus</hi> a Priest that travailed the land for such purposes. The daughter being sole heire, and her mother being now dead, the father was very carefull to see her well matched according to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and accordingly acquainted his dearest friends and counsellers with his intent and purpose, who likewise travailed carefully in the cause, but could not speed to the fathers contentment. As shee grew in yeeres, so she excelled in beautie, and the father being as wicked as she was good and faire, became enamoured of his owne daughter, and importunately offered her marriage. Shee at the first being ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at the motion, yet at length gathering spirit, desired respite for forty dayes, and withall desired that it would please him to adorne her with such attire, jewels and ornaments, as became a Kings daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to weare, all which being granted, she privately sent for <hi>Gereber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> the Priest, and acquainted him with all the circumstances. The Priest advised her, that the safest way for her to avoid the incestuous King, was to avoid the land; shee immediately with the Priest, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with her fathers Iester and his wife, tooke shipping, and arrived at Antverp. When they had rested there a while, and recreated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, they of devotion (saith mine Author) sought out among woods and desarts, a solitarie place to remaine; in this resolution they came to a poore village called Ghele, (Gela saith <hi>Molanus</hi>) and from thence they went to a thicket called Zammale, where they rid some small quantity of ground, made a Caban to hold them all foure, where they continued well some three moneths, praying and fasting. In the meane while the Irish King missing his daughter <hi>Dympna,</hi> lamented greatly, made great inquirie, and offered great rewards to know what became of her, and having gotten inkling of her course, hoised up saile after her, and landed at Antverp, immediately hee made search, and sent messengers with large offers about, if haply they might heare of her. At the length, by the coyne which they offered for reward, she was found out, for they said, there was a faire young woman, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in a solitary place, which had sent for reliefe for her selfe, and three persons more with the like coyne. The messengers were brought to the place, who knowing her ranne forthwith with newes to the King, and he with much ioy made haste to the Caban, and when he saw her, said; <hi>O my onely daughter Dympna, my love, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and the ioy of my heart; what constrained thee to despise a regall dignity, to forsake thy native soile, to forget the naturall affection of a Childe toward her Parent, to flee from thy father a King, and to follow, as a childe, this old decrepit bald Priest, and so willingly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend to his unsavorie injunctions? hearken to mine advice, returne with me into Ireland, yeeld to thy fathers desire, and I will advance thee above all the Ladies in Ireland. Gerebernus</hi> the Priest, preventing the young Gentlewoman, turned him to the Irish King, and rebuked
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18659:115"/>
him sharpely, denouncing him for a most wicked and abhominable person; then he turned him to the Gentlewoman, and charged her never to give eare to so lewd a man. With this the King and his company being mightily moved, commanded the Priest to be taken aside, and his head to be taken off his shoulders. Afterward the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther turned him to his daughter, <hi>O daughter, (saith he) why suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferest thou mee thy father to bee thus vexed? why contemnest thou my love towards thee? yeeld, and thou shalt want nothing.</hi> Shee with a sterne countenance made answer, <hi>Thou infortunate tyrant, why goest thou about with deceitfull promises, to withdraw me from my set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led purpose of shamefastnesse? I defie thee, and all thine. Thou cruell ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, why hast thou slaine the Lords Priest? shalt thou escape (thinkest thou) the iudgement of the Almighty? what torture thou wilt lay upon me, I weigh not</hi>: with this, the father being furiously moved, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his souldiers to cut off her head, and they being loath to doe it, he tooke the sword that hung by his side, and with his own hands strucke off her head, and with expedition returned into Ireland. Thus the Priest and <hi>Dympna</hi> died, of the Iester and his wife I reade no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, belike they returned home againe. <hi>Molanus</hi> writeth, that many yeeres after, the bodies of <hi>Dympna</hi> and <hi>Gerebernus</hi> were sought ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> His words are these. <hi>Some suppose that Saint Rumold was the sonne of Erfinus King of Scots, after whom suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the kingdome, the third and fourth sonne, Fergusius and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaius, but the names of the first and second sonne are not extant. They adde happely unto the rest, that because he was the King of Scots his sonne, it stood him upon to forsake the Bishopricke of Dublin, when Solvathius that raigned betweene Fergusius and Achaius, warred against the Irish, and upon this occasion, he tooke his iourney to Rome, and at his returne, preached the Gospell at Mechlin. All which, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring the times, would have some great probabilitie, unlesse the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Monuments and Records of Mechlin, had avouched him to have beene the sonne of one David a King, and to have beene brought forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, by the intercession and devout prayers of Gualafer, Bishop of Dublin, and of him baptized, whereby I gather, that he was the sonne of some King of Ireland. Neither is it any mervaile, though we reade not of this David, when as Saint Bernard witnesseth, that Ireland was not governed by one King, but by many; the orderly succession of which Kings, I suppose for the most part is now perished. If you urge that hee came of the Scottish bloud royall; I admit it, for it is so sung every where throughout the Diocesse of Mechlin, but that of old the Irish men were understood and comprehended under the name of Scots, by the life of Saint Patricke and elsewhere, is very manifest. To this purpose is that which Beda affirmeth, that Ireland is properly the country of the Scots, and Ionas also writeth in the entrance to Columbanus his life, how that the Scottish nation inhabit the Iland of the Irish. This Rumoldus died, Anno</hi> 775. <hi>and is honoured in Mechlin for their Patron.</hi>

                  <p>Next commeth <hi>Turgesius</hi> his time to bee examined, who was of Norwey, and came with great power of Esterlings into Ireland, van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished King <hi>Edlumding,</hi> or <hi>Edlimidus,</hi> or in Irish, <hi>Felim Mac Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund,</hi> and raigned thirty yeeres. Here (gentle reader) observe certain errours or escapes (whether of ignorance, wilfulnesse, or negligence, I know not) the which I finde betweene <hi>Cambrensis, Polychronicon, Fabian</hi> and others, touching <hi>Gurmund</hi> and <hi>Turgesius.</hi> First, that <hi>Gur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> and <hi>Turgesius</hi> should be one man, the end of them both by a generall consent of Writers, reproveth that; for <hi>Gurmund</hi> dyed in France, and <hi>Turgesius</hi> was slaine in Ireland. Secondly, (whereat <hi>Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raldus</hi> marvaileth) how that the Antiquaries of England make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Gurmund,</hi> but nothing of <hi>Turgesius,</hi> and that the Writers of Ireland speake of <hi>Turgesius,</hi> but little or nothing of <hi>Gurmund</hi>; so that <hi>Turgesius</hi> by reason of his raigne and continuance was knowne unto them, and <hi>Gurmund,</hi> if he were here, made small abode, (as I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly written) and therefore became a man unknowne. Thirdly, that <hi>Turgesius</hi> should be <hi>Gurmunds</hi> deputie in Ireland, or his brother (as I reade in <hi>Fabian</hi>) cannot possibly stand with the truth: for on all sides it is agreed, that <hi>Gurmund</hi> came to Britaine, and ioyned with the Saxons against <hi>Careticus,</hi> who began his raigne in Britaine, <hi>anno</hi> 586. but, as saith <hi>Cambrensis, Turgesius</hi> Captaine of the Norwegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Danes or Esterlings, came to Ireland in the daies of <hi>Fedlimidius,</hi> which was 400. yeeres from the comming of the first <hi>Patricke</hi> into the land, in the which time there had raigned thirty three Kings or Monarchs; then this knot with facilitie may be untied,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Turgesius</hi> came to Ireland, <hi>Anno</hi> 832.</note> for <hi>Patricke</hi> came to Ireland (as I have formerly delivered) <hi>An.</hi> 432. adde 400. to it, then <hi>Turgesius</hi> came to Ireland, <hi>Anno</hi> 832. But forward with the history.</p>

Toward the end of the terme before mentioned, <hi>Turgesius</hi> was enamoured on a faire Gentlewoman, the onely daughter of <hi>Omalaghlin,</hi> King of Meth, and desired her for his Concubine; he practised with the father for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of his purpose, the father not willing to yeeld, nor daring to displease, resolved him thus: Appoint the day, the houre, and the place, and sequester your selfe from your Court and retinue, and I will send my daughter unto you with twelve or sixteene Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of the choice and beautifullest maidens of my country, and take your choice of them; if my daughter please you best, she is at your command.</p>
                  <p>When the time appointed came, and the Lecher longed to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his filthy lust, <hi>Omalaghlin</hi> attired his daughter in princely sort, and sent her to King <hi>Turgesius,</hi> with sixteene young men in womens attire, which had long Skeines under their Mantles. These young springals were faire, beautifull, effeminate, and amiable to look upon; they were brought to his chamber, and presented before him, he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Gentlewoman by the middle, and kisseth her, the Striplings out with their Skeines,<note place="margin">

To make the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry short, (for they made short worke with it) they set upon the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wegians and Danes, killed them every mothers sonne that escaped not by flight, seized upon all their possessions, so as together with their lives, they lost all their lands and goods: and, saith the Irish Chronicle,<note place="margin">

For there were two <hi>Patrickes,</hi> the first a very learned and godly man, the second a Abbot, and given to superstition, and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the fabulous Purgatorie, which goeth in Ireland under the name of Saint <hi>Patrickes</hi> Purgatorie; so write <hi>Ranulphus,</hi> Monke of Chester, and <hi>Bale,</hi> Bishop of Ossory, though <hi>Stanihurst</hi> allow not of it, but attribute it to the first <hi>Patricke,</hi> and that without warrant.</p>
                  <p>In his time there rose a great rebellion in Ireland, so that hee fled into Britaine, and lyeth buried in Glastenbury. The Martyrologe of Sarum reporteth, that in Ireland they keepe the feast of <hi>Patricke</hi> the Abbot, the 24. of August. <hi>Stanihurst</hi> to further his credite, delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that he wrote a booke of Homilies, and certaine Epistles dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the Irish.<note place="margin">Saint <hi>Patricks</hi> Purgatory.</note> The sounder opinion is, (the which <hi>Stanihurst</hi> at unawares remembred out of <hi>Claudianus</hi>) that the place there, was in like sort as it is now in the time of Paganisme, and was long before Saint <hi>Patrickes</hi> dayes, And it seemeth to be after the manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavities in the bowels of the earth, where the ayre entring naturally to avoid <hi>Vacuum,</hi> and the winde following, whisteleth and crieth like dolefull ghosts; the silly ignorant and simple people being deceived through perswasion of covetous Priests, that some soules and spirits doe penance there for their sinnes, call it a Purgatorie. And further we see by reason and daily experience in Miners, that if any be much under grownd, the dampnesse of the earth takes away their lively co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and makes them looke ghastly, and if they continue any long while there (the vitall spirits being barred of their usuall course) they are mightily tormented, cast into trances, and distracted, and being once delivered from the place, report things at randon of heaven and earth, beleeve them who list.</p>

                     <hi>Anno</hi> 877. (<hi>Graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Cooper,</hi> and <hi>Buchanan</hi> are mine Authors) great troubles and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery fell upon Ireland; the circumstances in briefe were these. The Citizens of Dublin found themselves grieved, and mightily wronged by the Scots of Galloway; that whereas certaine tall ships of theirs were wind-driven thither, the Scots fell upon them, rifled them, and thereof made a prey. In revenge whereof, the people of Dublin ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Irish forces, arrived there, and preyed the country. <hi>Gregory</hi> the King having intelligence thereof, hastened with his forces, to encounter with them; the Irish fearing the worse, got them with their pillage aboard their shippes, and hoised up sailes for Ireland: <hi>Gregory</hi> prepareth his navy, and shortly after arriveth in Ireland.</p>
                  <p>The King at that time (saith <hi>Buchanan</hi>) was but a childe, whose name was <hi>Duncanus,</hi> or <hi>Donatus,</hi> or rather <hi>Dunachus</hi>;<note place="margin">

                     </note> the Protectors or chiefe commanders of the land about the King, were <hi>Brian</hi> and <hi>Cornelius,</hi> who had drawne the land into two factions. The Irish hering of the comming of <hi>Gregory,</hi> fortified themselves upon the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the Band, but there the Scots overthrew them; <hi>Brian</hi> was slaine, and <hi>Cornelius</hi> put to flight. The Scots left them not so,<note place="margin">Scots at the Band over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Irish.</note> but pursued them, preyed the country without resistance, constrained the townes before them to yeeld, and hearing by the way that <hi>Cornelius</hi> gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all the forces of Ireland against them, made ready to ioyn battaile, in the which, <hi>Cornelius</hi> and all his forces were foiled, so that for a safeguard of his life, hee fled to Dublin, and his armie dispersed themselves abroad. <hi>Gregory</hi> followed him, laid siege to Dublin, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18659:123"/>
by reason there were so many received within that fled from the field, they could not long indure the strength of the puissant King of Scots without,<note place="margin">Dublin receive the Scots. <hi>Cormack,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin.</note> wherefore by generall consent of the Citizens, <hi>Cormacke,</hi> Bishop of Dublin, opened the gates, received the King of Scots, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out losse of any man of either side, or damage of goods. Immediately <hi>Gregory</hi> the King of Scots, went to his cousin <hi>Duncan</hi> the young King, saluted him, and delivered unto him that he came not for his kingdome, ne for gold nor silver, ne for commodities of his country, but onely to be revenged of them that had formerly injured his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. And as for you, said he, cousin <hi>Duncan,</hi> I beare you no malice; without bloud I came into the Citie of Dublin, without bloud I will depart; recompence of the Citizens of Dublin I seeke none, the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants betweene this and the Band have satisfied me and my people, let the Citizens pay it them againe, and make no more such rash at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts into Scotland.

Hee went to the King, and complained of the abuse here spoken of; the King answered, <hi>He is my sonne, give thou iudgement upon him</hi>; saith the Merchant, <hi>let him keepe the whore still, I will be revenged upon him and his partakers in the field, as soone as
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18659:125"/>
possibly may be, and I doubt not but all Ireland shall rue the day of this villanie.</hi> Immediately he went to Denmarke, brought over to his aide, thirty thousand Danes and Norwegians, landed at Clantarfe, whereof the field was called the field of Clantarfe; hee summoned <hi>Morogh</hi> and his favourites to fight, and thought at the first to have taken Dublin. <hi>Brian Borow</hi> fearing this, made more haste then good speed, tarried not for the forces of the land, that were comming with his sonne <hi>Donogh</hi> to his aide, but rashly with his sonne <hi>Morogh,</hi> (the Author of all this mischiefe) gave them battaile. The which bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile all the forenoone being cruelly fought, seemed all to leane on the Irish side, but in the afternoone, the Danes that were in the rere, and yet fresh for any fight they had, were directed to wheele about, and to take the voward unknowne unto the Irish, which fiercely fought and encountred with the wearie and wounded Irish, and wonne the field. Here was <hi>Brian Borow,</hi> and his sonne <hi>Morogh,</hi> and eleven thousand of the Irish slaine.</p>
                  <p>One thing further (gentle reader) note, there was a Priests sonne, accounted a tall man of armes, who in the beginning of the battaile, fled away, fearing the hardinesse of the Danes and Norwegians, and went to <hi>Donogh Mac Brian,</hi> the brother of <hi>Morogh,</hi> who was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming with forces to the field, and perswaded him to retraict; saying further, that there was no hope of good successe to bee obtained in this field. This man being taken, confessed the whole treason, and for punishment, was carried to the winde gates, twelve miles from Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, set alive standing in the ground, with a great heape of stones a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, as it pleased the Commanders to direct. In <hi>Stanihurst I</hi> finde that the the chiefe Potentates of the Irish, were <hi>Brian Borow, Miagh Mac Brian,</hi> (whom formerly <hi>I</hi> termed <hi>Morogh) Tady O Kel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Dolir Ahertegan,</hi> and <hi>Gille Barramed,</hi> and that they were buried at Kilmaniham, over against the great Crosse.</p>

                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1050. <hi>Conan</hi> gathered an armie of his friends in Ireland, attempting the second time the recoverie of his inheritance, he hoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up saile towards Wales, but on a sodaine there arose such a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest upon the seas, that scattered his Navie, and drowned the most part of his ships, so that he gave over the voyage for that time.</p>
                  <p>About this time (wherein the English and British historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers doe agree) <hi>Robert,</hi> Archbishop of Canterbury, accused Earle <hi>Godwin</hi> and his five sonnes, (especially <hi>Swaine</hi> and <hi>Harold</hi>) of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and Queene <hi>Editha</hi> the daughter of <hi>Godwin,</hi> of adulterie, who being called before the King, refused to appeare, and therefore were banished the land, and the Queene was put away from the King. <hi>Godwin</hi> and <hi>Swaine</hi> fled to Flanders, <hi>Harold</hi> and <hi>Leofwin (Warwell</hi> saith <hi>Holinshead)</hi> to Ireland, and the Queene was sent with one Maid to the Monasterie of Wilton. Immediately the King disposed of all their possessions. It was not long after ere <hi>Godwin</hi> and <hi>Swaine</hi> got shippes, men, munition, and all necessaries in Flanders, the like did <hi>Harold</hi> and <hi>Leofwin</hi> in Ireland, they all met upon the seas, to wit, the father, the mother, and the five sonnes; they spoyled the Ile of Wight, Partland, Peveneseny, Romny-heath, Folkeston, Dover,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:18659:126"/>
and Sandwich, and entring the Thames, destroyed Sheppey, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Kings houses at Mielton.<note place="margin">Or Midleton.</note> Then they met with the kings Fleet upon the seas, and being ready to fight, Bishop <hi>Stigand</hi> stept be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, and reconciled both sides in such sort, that the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored them their lands and goods, tooke home the Queene, and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished <hi>Robert</hi> the Archbishop, with all the French men which had put buzzes and suspitions into the Kings head.</p>

                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1054. as <hi>Powell</hi> in his annotations upon <hi>Caradoc,</hi> hath lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly collected; King <hi>Edward</hi> by evill counsell (as it was thought) banished <hi>Algar,</hi> Earle of Chester, which had treason laid to his charge, whereupon <hi>Algar</hi> gate him into Ireland, and there provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him eighteene shippes of warre, well appointed and manned with stalworth men, of Irish birth, returned and joyned himselfe with <hi>Griffith,</hi> King or Prince of Wales, who both together, invaded the country of Mercia about Hereford, where <hi>Ranulph,</hi> Earle of that country (who was sonne to King <hi>Edwards</hi> sister, named <hi>Goda,</hi> by her first husband <hi>Walter de Manut</hi>) came against them with a great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and met them about two miles from Hereford, where after a sore fight, by the space of three houres, <hi>Ranulph</hi> and his armie were discomfited, and about 500. of them slaine, and the rest put to flight, whom <hi>Griffith</hi> and <hi>Algar</hi> pursued to Hereford, and entring the towne, set the Cathedrall Church on fire, and slue the Bishop named <hi>Leogar,</hi> with seven of the Canons, and most lamentably (as it falleth out in warres) spoyled and burned the towne. King <hi>Edward</hi> being advertised hereof, gathered an armie, and sent <hi>Harold</hi> the sonne of Earle <hi>Godwin</hi> against them, who pursuing the enemies to North-Wales, passed through Stradlewyde to Snowdon: but <hi>Griffith</hi> and <hi>Algar</hi> being loath to meete <hi>Harold,</hi> got them againe into South-Wales, whereof <hi>Harold</hi> being advertised, left one part of his armie in North-Wales, to resist the enemy there, and returning with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidue to Hereford, caused a great trench to be cast round about the towne, with a high rampire, strongly fortifying the gates of the same. After this, by meanes of a parlee had with <hi>Griffith</hi> and <hi>Algar,</hi> at a place called Biligellagh, a peace was concluded, whereupon <hi>Algar</hi> being pardoned by the King, and restored againe to his Earledome, returned home to Chester.</p>
                  <p>About two yeeres after, <hi>Algar</hi> was accused againe of treason, and the second time exiled the land, fled into Ireland, where he was most ioyously received of his old followers, and offered more kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, then he requested, for hee had most honourably dealt with the Merchants and owners of the former ships, and most kindely intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and bounteously rewarded the Irish souldiers, the which then in his second extremity, was not forgotten. With shippes, men and munition out of Ireland, he bent his course to Wales, repaired to his old friend <hi>Griffith,</hi> Prince of Wales, where he was most welcome,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:18659:126"/>
and shortly restored againe to his Earldome by the meanes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty of certaine strangers, which had lately there arrived out of Norway.</p>

Further I finde recorded, that it was the manner to consecrate Bishops in this sort, and that the Monarch of Ireland in regard of his royall principalitie and title of honour with other priviledges belonging to his Monarchie, had negative voyce in the nomination of Bishops throughout his Realme. Secondly, how the Archbishop of Canterbury took of him that was so consecrated, a corporall oath of Canonicall obedience (as his predecessours for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly used) to him and his successors; and lastly, gave him letters te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimoniall thereof to the Monarch and King of Leynster:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cambrensis</hi> sheweth the reason of this consecration, namely, how that in Ireland as then, there was no Archbishop, but one Bishop consecrated another, untill that <hi>Anno</hi> 1148. <hi>Iohannes Papiron,</hi> a Priest Cardinall, sent from <hi>Eugenius</hi> 3. together with <hi>Christian,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Lismore, Legate of all Ireland, came to the land, and brought with them foures Paales. But of this more in another place.</p>
                  <p>The same <hi>Flattesburie</hi> writeth further, how that the said <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franke</hi> in like sort consecrated <hi>Donatus,</hi> Bishop of Dublin, <hi>Anno</hi> 1085.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:18659:127"/>About this time, <hi>Godwin</hi> and <hi>Edmund,</hi> sonnes to King <hi>Harold,</hi> (my Author is <hi>Thomas Walsingham,</hi> Monke of Saint Albans) which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had fled into Ireland for succour, unto <hi>Dermotte Mac O Nell,</hi> King of Ireland, returned with 66. saile, landed in Sommersetshire, (saith <hi>Stow</hi>) where <hi>Brian,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Eudo,</hi> Duke of Brabant, met them and gave them battaile, wherein (saith <hi>Stow</hi>) the brethren gate the victory, and the Irish men with many great preyes out of Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall and Devonshire returned into Ireland. But <hi>Walsingham</hi> (which seemeth more true) writeth that it was a bloudie battaile, wherein 1070. of the English and Normans, with certaine of the Nobilitie of the land, were slaine, and the enemies with aide of their ships, fled, and brought heavy newes home to their deerest friends in Ireland.</p>
                  <p>It is very like that <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour immediately upon this, sent great forces into Ireland, to bee revenged of them for relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or assisting his enemies: for <hi>Stow</hi> writeth out of <hi>William</hi> of Malmsbury, thus: <hi>Lanfranck, Archbishop of Canterbury, being in such favour with King William, that the said William thought not good to deny any thing that hee requested, procured by his industrie, that the said King left his ill custome of selling his prisoners which hee tooke in Ireland, which was a thing hardly granted unto him, and to Wolstan, Bishop of Worcester, the gaine that the King had by the sale of those Irish men was such.</hi>

                  <p>All the Lords of the Ilands sent messengers unto <hi>Murchard, alias Moragh O Brien,</hi> King of Ireland, that it would please him to send them some worthy man of royall bloud to be their King, during the nonage of <hi>Olanus,</hi> the sonne sonne of <hi>Godred,</hi> King of Man.

                  <p>About this time, to wit, <hi>Anno</hi> 1098. the Normans having slaine <hi>Rees ap Twyde,</hi> Prince of South-Wales, they bent their forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Griffith ap Conan,</hi> Prince of North-Wales, by the conduct of <hi>Hugh de Montgomerie,</hi> Earle of Saloppe and Arundell, (called of the Welchmen, <hi>Hugh Gough,</hi>) and of <hi>Hugh Vras,</hi> Earle of Chester. <hi>Griffith</hi> the Prince fled to the mountaines, and sent for aide into Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, (saith <hi>Caradoc</hi>) where he received cold comfort, then to avoid farther mischiefe and treason, which hee suspected to have beene wrought against him, fled into Ireland.

Powell</hi> writeth that hee was an Irish man by his mother, daughter of the King of Dublin, and also by his Grandmother, and that hee was borne in Ireland, and that he brought over with him out of that country into Wales, divers cunning Musitians, who devised in manner, all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentall musicke upon the Harpe and Crowth that is there used, and made lawes of minstrelsee to retaine the Musitians in due order.</p>
                  <p>I have not yet done with <hi>Magnus</hi> the Norwegian, of him <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> writeth a worthy storie. <hi>Magnus</hi> (saith he) caused a fleete to bee in readinesse of an 160. saile, and sailed into the Orkeneys, the which he forthwith subdued, he passed through all the Ilands, made them subject unto him, and arrived in the Ile of Man; when hee beheld how pleasant the Iland was, he made choice thereof for habitation, fortified therein, which of him to this day beares his name. Hee so hampered the inhabitants of Galloway in Scotland, that hee made them bring him timber to his Port for the frame of his fortifications. Afterward he sailed to Anglesey in Wales, where he met with two <hi>Hughs,</hi> both Earles, the one he slue, the other he put to flight, and made the Iland subiect unto him. The Welsh men gave him many gifts and rewards, he bade them farewell, and so returned to Man. He sent to <hi>Murchard, alias Morogh,</hi> King of Ireland, his shooes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding him to hang them upon his shoulders upon Christmas day as he passed through his Hall, in the sight of his Embassadors, that thereby he might understand that he was subject to <hi>Magnus</hi> the king. When the Irish men heard thereof, they tooke it in ill part, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:18659:128"/>
chafed exceedingly, but King <hi>Morogh,</hi> a wise and a sage Prince, smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the conceit, with great modesty and discretion gave this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer. I will not onely beare his shooes, but I had rather eate them, then that King <hi>Magnus</hi> should destroy any one Province in Ireland. Whereupon he fulfilled his command, honoured his Ambassadors, sent many Presents unto King <hi>Magnus,</hi> and concluded a league. The Ambassadors upon their returne, related all circumstances gave great report and commendation of the land, delivered how pleasant and fruitfull the soile was, the temperature of the ayre, and how healthfull the dwelling was. <hi>Magnus</hi> hearing this, immediately it ranne in his head to conquer all Ireland; he commanded a great fleet to be in a readinesse, and he himselfe going before with sixteene saile privily to espie and search out the strength of the land, and unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly ranging from his shippes, was upon a sodaine compassed and hemmed in by the Irishmen, and slaine, with all in a manner that were with him. Thus <hi>Magnus</hi> is become <hi>Minimus,</hi> in fine, hee was buried in Saint <hi>Patrickes</hi> Church of Downe. So farre <hi>Camden</hi> in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. The British Chronicle writeth, how that before this insolent attempt, he had procured for his sonne, a daughter of King <hi>Morogh</hi> in marriage, and that he made him King of Man, but I doe not finde that he enjoyed it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Carodoc</hi> writeth, how that <hi>Anno</hi> 1101. <hi>Robert de Mountgomerie,</hi> Earle of Salop, and <hi>Arnulph</hi> his brother, Earle of Pembroke, rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling against King <hi>Henry, Robert</hi> sent for aide to <hi>Magnus,</hi> but could get none, <hi>Arnulph</hi> sent <hi>Gerald</hi> of <hi>Windesore,</hi> his Steward to <hi>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, alias Morogh,</hi> King of Ireland, to desire his daughter in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, the which hee obtained with promise of great succours, which did encourage him the more against the King; whereupon <hi>Arnulph</hi> went with all haste into Ireland for his wife and Irish forces. Earle <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> seeing himselfe disappointed, sent to the King, desiring him that he might forsake the Realme, which thing the King granted, and he sailed into Normandie. <hi>Arnulph</hi> received message from the King, that either he should follow his brother, and depart the land, or yeeld him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to his mercie, he chose to forsake the land, and fled into Ireland. Not long after, <hi>Owen</hi> the sonne of <hi>Cadogan,</hi> after hee had done great mischiefe and spoile upon the English, Normans, Flemings, and Welsh men, fled into Ireland to King <hi>Morogh,</hi> who joyfully received him, for he had beene there before, returned to Wales, and fled thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the second time, and in like sort the third time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1113. or thereabout, <hi>Griffith</hi> the sonne of <hi>Rees ap Twyder,</hi> Prince of South-Wales, who for feare of the King, had beene of a childe brought up in Ireland, came to <hi>Gerald,</hi> Steward of Pembroke his brother in law, and others of his friends, to recover his country, whom the King by secret policies and practises pursued, so that hee was forced to flee againe.</p>

                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:18659:129"/>In the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the first, I finde that there was great stirre betweene <hi>Murchard</hi> or <hi>Morogh,</hi> King of Leynster, and the Citizens of Dublin, for it seemeth that hee used grievous exactions and tyrannies over them, so that the Dublinians in revenge of him, sent for <hi>Godred,</hi> King of Man, and the Ilands, so writeth <hi>Camden,</hi> and made him their King. <hi>Morogh</hi> mustereth his country, gathereth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, procureth aide, marcheth against his enemies, pitcheth his campe at the towne of Coridelis, sent his brother (by the mother side) <hi>Osi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,</hi> with three thousand horse well appointed to Dublin, where hee was slaine by <hi>Godred,</hi> and by the men of Dublin, and the rest discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited and put to flight. <hi>Godred</hi> found himselfe well satisfied with spoiles, and returned to Man; they of Dublin likewise thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in some sort reasonably well revenged of their King, quitted themselves for a while, and by mediation and intercession after many Presents and Gifts were reconciled. There was great banquetting and feasting, and ioy outward of all sides, but inward, lay venome and treason, like sparkles of fire covered with ashes, which broke forth not long after, as <hi>I</hi> am readie to deliver. <hi>Stanihurst, Grace</hi> and <hi>Dowlinge</hi> doe write, that the Councell of the Citie determining to establish and decree many good lawes and orders, for the publike weale of the towne, and commons of the same, appointed a solemne day of meeting, sent for <hi>Morogh</hi> their King, humbly craving with all loyall circumstances, his presence, counsaile, and assistance among them at the day appointed, the which hee granted; when the day came, and that they had debated many matters, the King as he sate merrily in his chaire, sporting himselfe, and reporting some pleasant historie, one suddenly stept unto him, and tooke away his weapon, the rest came upon him, and stabbed him to the death; they were not content with this, but they cast him into a base grave, and in further contempt and dispute of his person, they threw a dogge upon him, and earth upon them both, the which <hi>Dermotte</hi> his sonne revenged afterwards, as shall appeare in processe of the historie.</p>
                  <p>About the yeere 1134. after <hi>Functius</hi> his computation, one <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rold,</hi> borne in Ireland, (so writeth <hi>Saxo</hi>) gathered forces, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the terrour of Norway, affirming withall, that he was the sonne of <hi>Magnus</hi> the Dane that invaded Ireland, and for truth thereof, he would declare it by fire. When the time and place was appointed, with his bare feet he trode upon a fierie plate, and felt no hurt: the Norwegians admired, and would make him their King, which was the roote of many mischiefes in Norway. He was a man faire spoken, strong, hardy, and swift of foot, and it seemeth, after the manner of Ireland, that he went much bare, so that the soles of his feet were as hard as horne, and could not easily take harme by fire, by which meanes he deceived the Norwegians. <hi>Nicholaus,</hi> King of Denmarke, corrupted <hi>Magnus</hi> of Norway by secret meanes to cut him off.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:18659:129"/>
                     <hi>Magnus</hi> practised with <hi>Ericus</hi> a Danish Captaine, to dispatch him immediately after his Coronation. To bee short, <hi>Ericus</hi> came with great forces to Scypetors, (a Village where <hi>Herald</hi> was) in the night time, laid siege to his Pallace, and by the breake of day, pulled him and his sonnes forth by the head and shoulders, and put them to death.</p>
                  <p>In the time of <hi>Henry</hi> 1. King of England, flourished <hi>Celsus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Celsus,</hi> Bishop of Armagh.</note> Bishop of Armagh, and ended his dayes with the entrance of King <hi>Stephen</hi> to the Crowne. He descended of Noble Parentage in Ireland, whom Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> with others, for divers rare and singular gifts, highly commendeth; he had beene brought up in the Vniversitie of Oxen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, where in the liberall sciences, and profound literature, he excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led others of his time; when he perceived by the infirmities of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that age hastened to an end, and that his naturall course was in short time to be finished, he desired of them that were present, their favours, and prayed them to use meanes unto others that were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and especially unto the two Kings of Mounster, (so <hi>Bernard</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) that <hi>Malachias</hi> might succeed him in the Bishopricke of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Malachias</hi> in the time of King <hi>Stephen,</hi> succeeded <hi>Celsus</hi> in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke of Armagh, whose life Saint <hi>Bernard,</hi>

He was borne in Ireland amongst barbarous people (saith <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>) yet in his birth and native soile, hee sucked of them no more barbarousnesse, then the Sea fish take of the salt water. His Parents for wealth and might, were in great account in those dayes; he was brought up at Armagh, under <hi>Imarius</hi> the Anachorite, where <hi>Celsus</hi> made him both Deacon and Priest at the age of 25. yeeres, from thence with licence of <hi>Imarius</hi> and of <hi>Celsus,</hi> he went to <hi>Malchus,</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Lismore in Mounster, a man of Irish birth, that had beene a Monke sometimes in the Abbey of Winchester in England, and from thence advanced to the Bishopricke of Lismore. And to make the historie plaine, there was at that time, great warres betweene <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke,</hi> King of Mounster, and his brother for the Soveraignty; the brother prevaileth, <hi>Cormacke</hi> fleeth to the Bishop of Lismore, and in his distressed estate, tooke a Monkes Cell, and led a private life. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachias</hi> was appointed his Tutor, where <hi>Cormacke</hi> continued untill that a King there adjoyning, pittying his miserie, gathered forces, and restored him to his kingdome.</p>

By this time, <hi>Celsus</hi> spoken of before, fell sicke and dyed. The rude people thrust in <hi>Mauritius</hi> that usurped the place some five yeeres, then <hi>Malchus,</hi> Bishop of Lismore, and <hi>Gislebertus</hi> the first Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate that came to Ireland, from the Pope, called the Bishops and Princes of the land together, appointed <hi>Malachias</hi> for the place. And when death had swiftly cut off the intruder <hi>Mauritius,</hi> that damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nation thrust in <hi>Nigellus,</hi> but he prospered not long, so that <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chias</hi> enjoyed it quietly. Of the injury done to that Church, and the abuse of that time, heare <hi>Bernard,</hi> (as he learned of <hi>Conganus</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) report. The see of Ardmach (saith <hi>Bernard</hi>) for the reverence and honour of Saint <hi>Patricke</hi> the Apostle of that nation, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted that whole land to the faith, in the which See living, he ruled, and in which dying, he rested, is had of all men from the beginning, in so great reverence, that not onely the Bishops and Ministers of the Clergie, but the Kings and Princes of that nation, carry themselves in all obedience unto their Metropolitane, so that he being one, ruleth all: but there crept in a most detestable custome, through the divel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish ambition of certaine mighty men, that the holy See was obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by inheritable succession, neither were any suffered to enioy the Bishopricke, but such as were of their tribe and familie, neither did this execrable succession hold for a small time, but for the space of fifteene generations, now in this diabolicall malice elapsed. And so farre this wicked and adulterous generation had confirmed to it selfe this lewd interest, yea rather an injurie to be punished with all manner of death, that if at any time there should want Clerks of that race, yet never wanted Bishops. To be short, there were before <hi>Celsus,</hi> eight Bishops married men, besides himselfe, without orders, yet learned men; from hence over all Ireland, issued that dissolution of ecclesiastiall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, which <hi>Malachias</hi> found in Conor, the rooting out of godly censure, and the abandoning of religion; from hence every wherein stead of Christian meekenesse, was brought in cruell barbarousnesse,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:18659:130"/>
yea, paganisme and infidelity under a Christian name; for that which was not heard of from the originall of Christianitie, without order, without reason, the Metropolitans at their pleasure changed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased the number of Bishops, so that one Bishopricke contented not it selfe with one Bishop, and no marvaile, for how could it fare well with the members of so diseased a head? they possessed the Sanctuary of God in this sort, the space well neere of two hundred yeeres; hee meaneth unto the dayes of <hi>Celsus</hi> and <hi>Malachias. Cambrensis</hi> in his itinerarie of <hi>Cambria,</hi> had relation no doubt unto this, where he with <hi>Baldwin,</hi> Archbishop of Canterbury, in visitation about Wales, came to the Church called <hi>lure padaen vacor,</hi> that is, <hi>the Church of great Paternus,</hi> mis-stiled with the governement therof, for thus he writeth: <hi>This Church, like as many more throughout Ireland and Wales, hath a Laye man to their Abbot, use hath prevailed, and a lewd custome hath crept in, that great and mighty men in Parishes, have beene by the Clergie appointed Patrons and defendors; afterwards have usurped unto themselves the right thereof.</hi> Immediately hee reporteth of a travailer that came hither out of little Britaine in France, that had for his further knowledge seene many countries, and fashions of sundry nations, and entring into the said Church on the Sabbath day, way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for divine Service, they rung the Bell, they tould, they waited long, at length came in the Abbot, with some twenty after him in armes, and wilde lookes, every one having (<hi>fon villuge,</hi> so the Britaines ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it) a forrest Bill on his shoulder; the travailer asked which is the Abbot, answer was made the formost, with the greatest forrest Bill; the travailer asked, hath he any other ornament, or doth he use any other weede? answer being made, no, then said hee, I have travailed farre enough, I will see no more fashions whilst I live, after that I have seene an Abbot carry a forrest Bill upon his backe. Now to returne whence I have made this digression, for the abuse of the Church causeth me to abuse the reader.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Malachias,</hi> when he had peaceably enioyed Ardmagh some three yeeres, with the consent of the three Bishops and Princes, he resigned his place to <hi>Gelasius,</hi> and returned to his former Bishopricke, not of Conor, but of Dune, for he had placed one in Conor before, to wit, <hi>Oedanus</hi> his disciple; here <hi>Bernard</hi> noteth that where Dune and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor were before this time united through ambition and covetousnesse, this man of devotion and conscience, separated them againe, dividing the Churches as they had beene of old, for the good will he bare to Armagh, he tooke his iourney towards Rome, landed in Scotland, came to Yorke, sailed to France, and lodged at Clarevallis; hee came to Rome in the time of <hi>Innocentius</hi> 2. who made him his Legate of Ireland, in the roomth of <hi>Gislebert,</hi> the old man spoken of before, which had made sute to be removed. <hi>Boniface</hi> appointed Armagh to be a Metropolitane See, but did not effect it, and promised the pall
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:18659:131"/>
which he did not performe; <hi>Bernard</hi> maketh mention of two Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan Sees, one procured by <hi>Celsus,</hi> the other by <hi>Malachias</hi>; but where and how I finde no antient record. <hi>Bale</hi> is of opinion they were in <hi>vocibus,</hi> and not in <hi>rebus,</hi> for lacke of money to pay for them. Vpon his returne hee came to Clarevallis, thence to England, so to Scotland, (where King <hi>David</hi> most royally entertained him) and lastly, to his Abbey of Benchor in Vlster. Of his conversation, heare <hi>Bernard: from the day of his birth, to the day of his death, hee lived sine proprio,</hi> without claiming propertie in any thing; he had neither men servants, nor maid servants, neither townes nor villages, neither any reuenue ecclesiasticall or temporall in his Bishopricke; for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision, (<hi>ad mensam episcopalem</hi>) hee had no certainty allotted him whereupon a Bishop might live, hee had no certaine Monastery or dwelling place, for hee daily went about all the Parishes, preaching the Gospell, and living by the Gospell, as the Lord had ordained, saying, the labourer is worthy of his reward; of his labours and such as travelled with him, he carried about to relieve them all; to be short, <hi>Malachias</hi> neither in dyet or rayment was discerned from the rest of the brethren; when he went a preaching with footmen, he went on foot, being a Bishop and a Legate: and here <hi>Bernard</hi> exclaimeth, when he entreth into the consideration of the difference betweene him and his brethren, and the nephewes of the Apostles, so he calleth them. Towards his latter dayes, hee sorrowed that Ireland had not the pall, and as oft as he thought upon <hi>Innocentius</hi> 2. his promise, he sighed, who (as formerly I have delivered) had promised, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; when he heard that <hi>Eugenius</hi> his successor was come unto France, he thought it a fit time to obtaine his purpose, he tooke ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping for Scotland, where King <hi>David</hi> received him as in times past, and thence unto England, where the jarre betweene the King of England, and the Pope, hindred his passage, yet he got into France, and straight to Clarevallis, where hearing that Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> was returned to Rome, he rested himselfe, fell sicke of an ague, and there dyed, being of the age of 54. yeeres, <hi>Anno</hi> 1148. 4 <hi>Nonas Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bris,</hi> so farre <hi>Bernard</hi> in substance, yet <hi>Antonine</hi> saith hee dyed, <hi>Anno</hi> 1140.</p>

(<hi>Iohn Clin</hi> and <hi>Iohn Stow</hi> are mine Authors) now that <hi>Dermot</hi> is fled, I am to insert a story out of the British Chronicles of Conwey and Strotflur Abbeyes, afore I discourse of him which was in the same yeere, that he tooke the sea, how that <hi>Owen Gwyneth,</hi> Prince of North-Wales, had a sonne called <hi>Ryryd,</hi> who in the right of his wife, as it seemeth, was Lord of Clochran in Ireland, and another sonne begotten vpon an Irish woman, called <hi>Howell,</hi> and a third sonne cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Madoc.</hi> This <hi>Madoc</hi> finding his country in great contention, and his brethren at civill warres, prepared certaine ships with men and munition out of Wales and Ireland, and sought adventures by seas, he sailed west from the coast of Ireland, so farre north, that hee came to a land unknowne, where he saw many strange things. This land in the opinion of <hi>Humphrey Lloyde,</hi> the great Antiquary of Britaine, must needs be some part of that country, of which the Spaniards af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme themselves to be the first discoverers since <hi>Hannos</hi> time. For by reason and order of cosmographie, this land to the which <hi>Madoc</hi> came, must needs be sonne part of Nova-hispania, or Florida; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it is manifest that the same country was long before discovered by Britaines and Irish men, afore either <hi>Columbus</hi> or <hi>Americus Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> led any Spaniards thither. Of the voyage and returne of this <hi>Madoc,</hi> there be many fables, the which I will not report. He prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ships for a second voyage, and tooke with him men and women to inhabit that land, therefore it is to be presupposed that he and his people inhabited part of those countries, for it appeareth by <hi>Francis Loves,</hi> that in Acusanus and other places, the people honoured the Crosse, whereby it may be gathered, that Christians had been there before the comming of the Spaniards: but because this people were not many, they followed the manners of the land, and used their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. I am of opinion with others, that the land whereunto <hi>Madoc</hi> came, was some part of Mexico; first of all, for that the inhabitants of that land report, their Rulers to have descended from a strange
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:18659:134"/>
nation that came from a far country, which thing is confessed by <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesuma,</hi> King of that country, in his orations made for quieting of his people at his submission to the King of Castile, <hi>Hernando Curtecius</hi> being then present, which is laid downe in the Spanish Chronicles, of the conquest of the West-Indies; secondly the british words and names of places used in that country to this day, doe argue the same, as when they talke together, (they say) <hi>Gwrando,</hi> which is <hi>hearken</hi> or <hi>listen</hi> in British. Also if you peruse Sir <hi>Humphrey Gilberts</hi> disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, they have a Bird, which they call Pengwin in Brittish and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, a white-head, but the Iland of Corroeso, the Cape of Britaine, the river of Gwyndoor and the white rocke of Pengwyn, be British or Welch words: whereby it appeareth, that it was that country which <hi>Madoc</hi> and his people inhabited: now remembring my selfe that my pen hath not carryed me so far unto forraigne countries by sea, but that I expect <hi>Dermots</hi> returne by sea and by land into Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. <hi>Dermot Mac Morogh</hi> came to <hi>Henry</hi> 2. in Normandie, made his moane (as formerly in substance is delivered) craved aide for his restitution into his country, being a King exiled, although distressed and void of comfort, unlesse hee might obtaine it at his Majesties hands; the Kings hands being full of warres, he granted him his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable letters as followeth.</p>

Trumpets sound, the horses neyghing, and beheld their glittering Armes, the ratling of their furniture, horse and men in compleat Armes, and all most comely in battaile array, (the like of them not formerly seene, neither heard of) they alter their mindes, they retire into the towne, they make fast their gates, and fire the suburbs. <hi>Fitz Stephens</hi> came to the wals, filled the trenches with armed men, and appointed his Archers to levell at the wals and turrets, if occasion were offered: the townesmen manfully defended themselves, threw over the wals great stones and pieces of timber, hurt many, and made them voyd the place, among whom, a couragious Knight, called <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid Barrye,</hi> adventured to scale the walles, but with a great stone which fell upon his head-piece, he was cast downe to the ditch, and carried away by his fellowes with safeguard of his life, upon this they goe to the sea strand, and fired all the ships and vessels which they found there.</p>
                  <p>The next day after, upon better advice and deliberation, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto the wals, and gave a new assault, the townesmen within beganne to distrust their state, being upon this sudden arrivall of the strangers, not sufficiently provided of men, munition, and victuals, to encounter with them, and remembring againe, how most unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally they had rebelled against their Prince and Soveraigne, they sent messengers to <hi>Dermot,</hi> to intreate for peace, (alas it was farre from the heart) the which was granted, and tooke of them pledges and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stages for the performance thereof. Lastly, <hi>Mac Moragh,</hi> according to his former promise gratified these first adventures, hee gave unto <hi>Robert Fitz Stephens,</hi> and <hi>Morrice Fitz Gerrald,</hi> who was as yet in England, the towne of Wexford, and the territories thereunto ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyning, and unto <hi>Hervie de Monte Morisco,</hi> two cantreds on the sea side, betwixt Wexford and Waterford.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dermot Mac Moroch</hi> and his company now take heart, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease their Army with Wexford men, and become 3000. strong. The next iourney they bend their course towards Ossory, where one <hi>Donald,</hi> or <hi>Mac Donell</hi> was Prince, whom <hi>Dermot</hi> hated deadly, and for this cause <hi>Donald</hi> suspected <hi>Dermots</hi> sonne and heire to have much familiaritie with his wife, and therefore in his jealous humour, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended him, imprisoned him, and pulled out both his eyes, (but say they) though sight failed him, his feeling did not, for she loved him the more, in so much that she satisfied his lust, and ranne away after him. When <hi>Robert Fitz Stephens,</hi> and the Gallants of Britaine entred the country, they found neither dastards, nor cowards, but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant men with horse and foot; they found the country fast with woods, bogges, and paces trenched and plashed; yet the valour of the adventurers was such, presuming upon former fortunes, to have the like future successes, with loose wings drove them out of the woods and bogges, into the plaine and champion land, where the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:18659:136"/>
horsemen with their speares overthrew them, and the foote finding them groveling, runne them thorow, and ended their dayes; the Gallowglasses followed, and cut off their heads. And here <hi>Dermot Mac Morogh</hi> is mightily condemned, he being originally for exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, extortion, cruelty, tyranny, and other damnable offences, iustly exiled, now sheweth no Princely stomacke, but a base Wolvish minde; for when 300. of the Ossory mens heads were throwne at his feete, (alas they had not offended) hee viewed them all, and finding one whom he knew, and mortally hated, he held him by the head and eares, and most brutishly with his teeth, bit the nose and lips of the dead, whom without the ayde of the Britaines, hee durst not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold in the face. In this bloudy course, <hi>Dermot</hi> directed these worthy warriours, they more affecting the prey for their present mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, then the bloud of any person, to spoyle, burne, waste the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and murther the poore and seely people, which God wot, meant no harme: whereupon <hi>Donald,</hi> Prince of Ossory, despising <hi>Dermot Mac Morogh,</hi> by the advice of his Councell and friends, sent to <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Fitz Stephens</hi> in writing as followeth: Sir Knight of Noble race, renowned for martiall prowesse, <hi>Donald</hi> Prince of Ossory sendeth greeting: <hi>Dermot</hi> that damnable adulterer in his owne person, with the King of Meths wife, and in his sonnes person with my wife, have drawne thee and those Gallants, (most worthy Knights) into this poore country and naked people: I will yeeld my selfe (it is for the good of my poore followers) into thy hands, peace I crave, and peace let me have. <hi>Robert Fitz Stephens</hi> acquainted <hi>Dermot Mac Morogh</hi> with the premises of all sides, the Irish dissembled, (as hereafter shall further appeare) peace they granted, and they acknowledged <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot</hi> for their Lord and Soveraigne. In all this service, I may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale what <hi>Cambrensis</hi> delivereth. <hi>David Barry</hi> and <hi>Meilerius,</hi> effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted singular exployts, and deserved no lesse commendations. As soone as the good successe of <hi>Dermot</hi> and the strangers lately arrived, was spread abroad, <hi>Rory Oconochor, alias Rodericke,</hi> King of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught, Monarch of Ireland, called the Princes and Nobles of the land together, and layeth before them the dangerous estate and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent perill of the whole land, how <hi>Dermot</hi> guilefully had tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in strangers, how hee and the strangers were like to ouer-runne all, unlesse with all expedition, this mischiefe were prevented; in summe they concluded, that every man shall to his Armes, and make ready horse and foot, and set upon these invaders.</p>

And here by my messenger receive to defray your charges, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port you to your native soyle. Robert Fitz Stephens answereth, your present I will not accept, faith and troth I have pawned to my friend Dermot, I will not breake: hee forsakes not me, I will not forsake him, neither leave him distressed; you speake of lechery, what is that among martiall men? I heare you have Bastards your selfe, to what end is your embassie? If Roderick give councell, we need it not; if he Prophecie, we credit not his oracle; if he command as a Prince, we obey not his auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; if hee threaten as an enemie, a figge for his Monarchy.</hi> The messenger returned with small welcome, going and comming; <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deric</hi> bethought himselfe againe, and sent letters to <hi>Dermot,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading him to be at peace with his country people, and to banish the strangers out of the Land; he rejected his councell and despiseth the messenger: <hi>Roderic</hi> seeing that his private practises tooke small effect, put himselfe in armes, assembleth his forces, and delivereth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them these speeches: <hi>You right worthy and valiant defenders of your Country and liberty; Consider with what people and for what cause wee are now to fight and wage battell, the enemy of his owne Country, the tyrant over his owne people, the exile fugitive, behold hee is returned backed with strangers, and purposeth to destroy us and the whole Nation; hee being an enemy, hath brought in those enemies, which have beene ever hatefull unto us all, and are most greedy to have the Soveraignty and Dominion over us all, protesting openly and firmely avouching, that by fatall destiny they are to bee Commanders

O cruell beast, (yea more cruell then ever was beast) who lately bit with his owne teeth, the nose and lips of the dead: he to satisfie his insatiable malice and bloudy minde, spareth neither man, woman, nor childe: he deserveth well to be hated of all, that opposeth himselfe an enemy to all; wherefore my lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and deere country men, be well advised, looke about you, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider advisedly, how by the like meanes, (I meane civill warres) all Realmes and nations for the most part have beene overthrowne and brought to utter ruine.</hi> Iulius Caesar <hi>attempted the invasion of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, was twice foyled, and indured the repulse, but when</hi> Androgeus <hi>Duke of London fell at variance with the King, to be revenged, sent for</hi> Iulius, <hi>who thereupon returning, subdued the land.

God knoweth, your consciences are cleare, your cause honest, to take Armes in defence of your Prince, and Countrey? Why doe they not behold the blemishes, nay the hainous enormities and villanies that raigne among them? Their carrows, their kerne, their theeves, their murders, their swearing, their lying, their drunkennesse, their whordome and bloody minds who reformeth? The Tyrant</hi> Roderic <hi>hath murdered his owne naturall brother, hee hath three wives alive, he hath eleven bastards by severall women: O villaine, to behold a mote in our eye, and cannot see a beame in his owne. If the tyrant make challenge and pretend title to Leinster, because the same hath sometimes beene tributarie to some one King of Connoght; by the same reason also may wee demand and challenge all Connoght; for our ancestors have beene sole Governours of both, and Monarchs of all Ireland. The Lawes of all Nations doe permit, and allow to resist and withstand force and injury, with force and strength; Let us be of good courage, wee stand vpon a good ground, our seat is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally very strong of it selfe, &amp; now by our industry made more defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive; feare nothing, quit your selves like men.

You my companions in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall affaires, you lusty young gallants that have endured with me many perils, yet still retaine your noble and valiant courage; consider whence wee came, what wee are, and the cause we have in hand; we are lineally descended from Troy, whose fame hath filled the whole earth, and now lately some of us out of Normandy, have seated our selves in Brittaine, and have to our wives, children, and kindred of the ancient and noble Brittish race; of the one we cary our valiant and noble mind, of the other wee learned the experience in feates of Armes; wee are not come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as pirats and theeves, to robbe and spoile (as it is well knowne unto you) wee had our native soile to inhabit, wee had our kindred about us,

It is more honorable to make then to be a King, and to restore then to exile: he is a Prince of a bountifull mind, hee hath promised large for us and our heires after us, hee hath in part already most faithfully performed, his yeeres are many, and his daies are but few; after him wee shall enjoie his, and if we overcome the enemy, wee shall possesse all: feare not death; it is but a short delay betweene transitory and eternall life, it is but a short pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage from vaine and temporall delights, to certaine and perpetuall joies, if we conquer here, wee shall inherit here, and purchase unto us immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall fame; if we misse here, we are sure of a Kingdome in another world. Roderic</hi> considering with himselfe, the events of warres how doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and uncertaine they are, wrought all meanes to intreat for peace, being timerous to adventure battaile with strangers, whose force hee mightily feared, and whose puissance and valour being renowned, he was loth to encounter withall; he sent messengers unto <hi>Dermot Mac Morogh,</hi> promising him that hee and his heires should in peace and quietnesse enjoy all Leinster, and acknowledge him for his chiefe King and Monarch, and to yeeld unto him the service and homage that to that belonged; and that he should deliver him his sonne <hi>Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thurus (Cnothurinus</hi> saith <hi>Stanyhurst</hi>) for pledge and hostage. And if the peace were truly kept and performed, <hi>Roderic</hi> promised to give him his daughter in marriage, and in the end when Leinster should bee quitly setled and reduced to the old Irish order, <hi>Dermot</hi> should drive away the Brittans and strangers, and procure no more into the Land; all this was concluded vpon, and solemnely undertaken by oathes on both sides, yet all was but flat dissimulation. In the nook of this, landeth at Wexford <hi>Maurice Fitz Girald,</hi> brother to <hi>Robert Fitz Stephens</hi> by the mothers side, in two ships, having in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, tenne Knights, thirty horsemen, archers and foot a hundred, whereof <hi>Dermot</hi> was very glad and mightily encouraged on everie side. And immediately tooke with him <hi>Morice Fitz Girald,</hi> and bent his forces towards <hi>Dublin,</hi> to be revenged on them, for many wrongs, and especially for the death of his father, whom they murthered in their Councell house, as formerly hath beene delivered, and after for more despite buried him with a Dog: They left <hi>Robert Fitz Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens</hi> behind busily imployed in building of a Fort or a strong hold some two miles from Wexford, in British and Irish called the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke.

As they drew neere Dublin, they preyed, they spoyled, they burned all before them. Dublin trembled for feare, the townesmen intreated for peace, the which was granted upon the delivery of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine pledges and hostages<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Whereupon there arose deadly hatred and martiall warres: <hi>Roderic</hi> drew all his forces against him; <hi>Dermot Mac Moroogh</hi> sent to <hi>Robert Fitz Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens,</hi> that in all haste he should draw forces to the ayde of <hi>Donald</hi> Prince of Limirike his sonne in law, which was accordingly affected, where <hi>Roderic</hi> was foyled, lost his chiefery, and with shame enough returned to his own country. Now <hi>Dermot Mac Morogh</hi> is puffed up with these prosperous successes, and whereas a while agoe, he would have contented himselfe with Leynster alone, now Connaght and all Ireland seeme little enough unto his aspiring minde. Secretly hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainteth <hi>Robert Fitz Stephens,</hi> and <hi>Maurice Fitz Gerald</hi> with his purpose, and offereth any of them his daughter and heire with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance after, upon condition, that they should send for supplies of their kindred and country men, to effect his enterprises; they modest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thanked him for his offers, and refused his daughter, for that they were both already married, and withall wished him to write for <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Strangbow,</hi> with whom he had formerly concluded to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, unto whom he addresseth his messenger, and directeth his let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in this forme:</p>

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:18659:139"/>
prisoners and captives: for my part I doe not thinke it good, nor yet allow that any favour or curtesie should be at al shewed to the enemy, but understand you, these are no enemies now, but men; no rebels, but such as be vanquished and cleane overthrowne, and standing in defence of their country by evill fortune and hard destiny, are subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; their adventures were honest, and their attempts commendable, and therefore they are not to be reputed for theeves, factious persons, traitors, nor yet murtherers; they are now brought to that distresse and case, that rather mercy for example sake is to bee shewed, then cruelty to the increase of their misery to be ministred: surely our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors in times past, (although indeed it bee very hard to be done) were wont when fortune favoured, to temper their loose mindes, and qualifie their unruly affections, with some one discommoditie or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: wherefore let mercy and pitty, which is in man most commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, worke so in us, that we that now have overcome others, may subdue our owne mindes, and conquer our owne affections. For mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty, moderation, and discretion, are wont to stay hasty motions, and to stoppe the course of rash devices. O how commendable and honourable is it to a Noble man, that in his greatest triumph and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he counteth it for a sufficient revenge, that hee can revenge, and be wreaked! <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> whose conquests were such, his victory so great, and his triumphs so many, that the whole world was noysed therewith, he had not so many friends who reioyced for the same, but he had many more enemies that maligned and enuied his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, not onely in slanderous words, and evill reports, but many also secretly conspired, devised and practised his death and destruction; And yet he was so full of pitty, mercy, and compassion, that he never commanded nor willed any to bee put to death for the same, saving onely one <hi>Domitius,</hi> whom he had of meere clemency for his lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse before pardoned, for his wickednesse released, and for his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery acquitted. And thus as his pitty did much increase his honour, so did it nothing hinder his victories. Oh how beastly then and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious is that cruelty, wherein victory is not ioyned with pitty! for it is the part of a right Noble and Valiant Conquerour, to count them enemies, that doe wage the battaile, contend and fight for the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but such as be conquered, taken prisoners, and kept in bonds and captivitie, to take and repute them for men; that hereby fortitude and force may diminish the battell, and end the quarrell, as also hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie may increase love, and make peace. It is therefore a great commendation, and more praise worthy to a noble man, in mercy to be bounteous, then in victory to be cruell. For the one onely lyeth in the course of fortune, but the other in vertue. And as it had beene a great increase of our victory, and an augmentation of honour, if our enemies had beene slaine in the field, and overthrowne in the battaile; so they being now taken and saved, as it were men returned from
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:18659:140"/>
rebels to the common society, and fellowship of men. If wee now should kill them, it will bee to our great shame, dishonor and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach for ever. And for as much as by the killing and destroying of them, wee shall bee never the neerer to have the command of the country, and never sooner to be Lords of the Land) and yet the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soming of them very good for the maintenance of the Souldiers, the good fame of us, and the advancement of honour) wee must need thinke that it is better to ransome them, then cruely to kill them; for as it is requisite, that a Souldier in the field fighting in armes, should then thrist for the blood of his enemy, trie the force of his sword, and valiantly stand to his tackle for victory; so when the fight is ended, the warres ceased, and the armour laid downe, and all strongnesse of hostility set apart, then in a Noble man must humanity take place, pitty and commiseration must be shewed, and all kindnesse of curtesie must be extended.</p>
                  <p>With this they were all drawen to some mildnesse and remorse, and ready to shew favour in hope of friendship againe. <hi>Henry de Monte Marisco,</hi> who came thither to salute <hi>Reimond,</hi> stands vp in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, bent to blood and villany, in whom there was neither man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood in battell abroad, nor mercy in consultation at home, and spake as followeth: <hi>Reimond</hi> hath very exquisitly discoursed of pitty and mercy in set speeches, uttering his eloquence hath shewed his mind, and declared his opinion, perswading and inducing us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that a strange land were to be conquered sooner by mercy and fond pittie, then by fire and sword; but I pray you, can there bee a worse way then to hold that course. Did <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> or <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Macedonia,</hi> by such meanes or in such order conquer the whole world; did the Nations from out of all places runne to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themselves under their command, and imperie in respect of their pitty and mercy, and not rather compelled so to doe for feare and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force? For people whilst they are yet proud and rebellious, all pitty and mercy set apart, are by all manner of meanes and wayes to bee subdued: but when they are once brought under subjection and bondage, &amp; ready to serve and obey, then they are with all curtesie to be intreated and kindly dealt withall, so that the state of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be in safety and void of da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger, herein &amp; in this point, must pitty be used; but in the other severity or rather cruelty is more necessary: here clemency is to be shewed, but in the other rigour without favour is to be ministred. <hi>Reimond</hi> perswadeth that mercy is to bee extended as upon people already subdued and subjected, or as though the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies were so few and of so small a number, as against whom no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant service nor chivalry can be exploited; and yet they are ready to joine with us, whereby our force may bee increased, and our power augmented: but alas, doe not we see, how that the whole notion and people of Ireland are fully bent and (not without cause) altogether conspired against us? surely me thinks <hi>Reimond</hi> is contrary to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:18659:140"/>
for why? his coming hither was not to dispute of pitty, nor to reason of mercy, but to conquer the nation, to subdue the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Oh what an example of impious pitty were it then, to neglect our owne safety, and to have remorse and compassion vpon others distresses! moreover wee have here in the field and in armour, more enemies then friends, we are in the middle of perils and dangers, our enemies being round about us in every corner: and shall wee thinke this to be nothing, but that we must bee also in the like distresse and danger among our selves: Round about us our enemies are infinit, and within our selves, some there be which practise and work our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction: And if it should happen that our Captives and Prisoners should escape, and breake loose out of their bonds, which are but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weake and slender, no doubt they would forthwith take our own armour and weapons against us; well, well, the Mouse is in the cub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bord, the Fire is in the lappe, and the Serpent is in the bosome, the enemie is at hand ready to oppresse his adversarie, and the guest is in place with small curtesie to requite his host. If our enemies, when they come in good array, and well appointed to give the onset, and to wage battel against us; if they should happen to have the victorie, &amp; the vpperhand over us, would they deale in pitty and mercy? would they grant us our lives? would they put us to ransome? Tush, what needs many words, when the deeds are apparent; our victory is to bee used, that the destruction of these few may bee a terror to many, whereby all others, and this wild and rebellious nation may take example, and bewar how they meddle and encounter with us; of two things we are to make choice of one, for either we must valiantly and couragiously stand to performe what we have taken in hand, and all fond pitty set aside, boldly and stoutly to overthrowe and van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish this rebellious and stubborne people, or (if we shall after the mind and opinion of <hi>Reimond</hi> altogether be pittiful and full of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy) we must hoise up our sailes, and returne home, leaving both the Country, and all that we have already gotten, to this miserable and wretched people. When <hi>Herveie</hi> had made an end of his speech; they put it to voyces, and the voyces went on <hi>Herveis</hi> side; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Captaines (as men condemned) were brought to the Rockes, and after their Limbs were broken, they were cast head long into the Seas, and drowned every mothers sonne.</p>

day being tuesday, with Banners displayed, in good aray they assaulted the City by water and by land, the townesmen manfully defended themselves, and gave them two repulses: <hi>Reimond</hi> having compassed the towne, espied without adjoyning unto the towne wall (where now standeth a strong Bulwarke) an old Cabban, propped with old timber, and entred into the old wall, the which proppes they sawed asunder, then downe falleth the cabban, and withall a great part of the wall: the breach thus made, the Brittains doe enter, and in the streets kill man, woman and child, and there left them in heapes: In <hi>Reignald</hi> tower, upon the wall of the tower they found one <hi>Reignald</hi> (I take it the tower beareth the name of him) and <hi>Omalaghlin Ophelim,</hi> Lord of the Decies, whose lives <hi>Dermot Mac Morogh</hi> saved: they found there other two, whom they put to the sword, they rifled the houses, they ransacked the City, they made havock of all, lastly they left there a strong ward. Then according to precedent cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, <hi>Dermot</hi> gave his daughter <hi>Eva</hi> in marriage to <hi>Richard Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow,</hi> and after solemnity thereof, they all marched with their forces towards Dublin: For <hi>Dermot</hi> bare them a deadly hatred, and hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto winked at them, untill further oportunity served, for the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany and cruelty they shewed to his father; the townsmen of Dublin foreseeing his revenging mind, procured to their aid as many as they could throughout the land, they trenched, they plashed in paces, streets and narrow places, all the wayes along to Waterford, to hinder their march. <hi>Dermot</hi> was not ignorant thereof, whereupon he led the army from out the common and beaten way, through the Mountaines of <hi>Glandelogh,</hi> and came safe to the walles of Dublin. There the Citizens sent messengers to intreat for peace, and amongst others, <hi>Laurence O Toole</hi> Arcbishop of Dublin: while they parled without for peace, Sir <hi>Remond le grosse,</hi> and Sir <hi>Miles Cogan</hi> scaled the wals; for, saith <hi>Cambrensis, they were more desirous to fight under Mars in the field, then in the Senate to sit with Iupiter in Councell</hi>; they made a breach, they enter the Citie, they put all to the sword: in the meane while, <hi>Hastulphus</hi> the Commander of the City, with a great many of the better sort, with their Riches and Iewels, escaped and fled by the Sea to the North Ilands.</p>
                  <p>When the Earle had spent a few daies in the towne, he left <hi>Miles Cogan</hi> Governour therof, and by the perswasion of <hi>Dermot Mac Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogh,</hi> he drew his forces into Meth to be avenged of <hi>Ororicke,</hi> whom some call <hi>Morice,</hi> some <hi>Murdich,</hi> who was the cause of his exile, and whose wife <hi>Dermot</hi> had formerly taken away. The Earle no sooner entred the Countrey, but the Army was given wholly to the spoile; they robbed, they spoiled, they burned, and wasted all before them: <hi>Roderic</hi> King of Conoght and Monarch of Ireland, seeing his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours house set one fire, thought it high time to looke to his owne, and wrotte to <hi>Dermot Mac Morogh,</hi> contrary to the order of Peace,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:18659:141"/>
formerly concluded, thou hast procured and allured a swarme and multitude of strangers, to invade this land; all the while thou didst containe thy selfe within compasse of thine owne territories, we win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked at thy proceedings, but forasmuch as now thou not caring for thy oath, nor regarding the safety of thy hostages, hast so fondly and falsly passed thy bounds, I require thee that thou wouldest retire, and withdraw these excourses and inrodes of strangers, or else, to begin, I will not faile to cut off thy sonnes head, and send it to thee with speed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dermot</hi> despised the messenger, and would scarce vouchsafe to reade his letter; upon the messengers returne, <hi>Roderic</hi> was mad, and in his rage, caused his pledges head, the sonne of <hi>Dermot Mac Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogh</hi> to be cut off. In this troublesome time, the Primate of Armagh called the Prelates and Clergie to a Synod; at Armagh, assembled a Councell; where, according to their wisedomes, they endeavoured to finde out the cause of these miseries that fell upon the land, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired not whether the Bishops had bought their Bishoprickes for money, whether their Parsons did pray, whether their Ministers were lettered; what whoredome, symony, or lechery, with other enormities, raigned among the Clergie, but simply, like themselves, posted over all to the Laytie, and concluded (<hi>insipienter</hi>) that the iust plague fell upon the people, for merchandizing of the English nation; for then they bought and sold of the English birth, such as they found, and made them bondslaves; so they served Saint <hi>Patricke,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Apostle of Ireland, who was a bondman sixe yeeres in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, but <hi>Patricke</hi> preached Christ, and the English nation reformed the land. Here the sacred letters reconcile all, <hi>the stone which the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders refused, is become the corner stone, and why so? the answer follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, it is the Lords doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes.</hi> But I may not so leave my Prelates, they synodically decreed as followeth: <hi>that all the English men within the land, whatsoever they were, should bee manumised</hi>; a worshipfull piece of worke, and no thanke to them all, for the English sword was then ready to cut off the Irish heads: this reformation was but a sweeping of a house with a Foxes tayle.</p>
                  <p>The prosperous successes of Earle <hi>Richard,</hi> surnamed <hi>Strangbow,</hi> were no sooner effected, but fame flyed abroad, and flatterers carried it to <hi>Henry</hi> the seconds eares, and made him jealous, as Kings com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly are, that a subject as <hi>Richard</hi> was, should not onely in the right of his wife, content himselfe with Leinster, but most presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuously without licence, as the King alledged, attempt the conquest of a kingdome, where he formerly by grant of <hi>Adrian,</hi> was interes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Whereupon the King in his iealous rage, indeavouring to stop the Springs and Water-courses, proclaimed: We, <hi>Henry, &amp;c. Forbid and inhibit, that from henceforth no shippe from any place of our domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

shall returne from thence into England before Easter next follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, upon paine of forfeiture of all their lands, and the persons so diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying, to be banished our land, and exiled for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Earle seeing himselfe in this distresse, being in perill to lose his friends, and to want his necessaries out of his native soile, by enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of Merchants, calleth a Councell; where it was agreed and concluded, that Sir <hi>Reimond Legrosse</hi> should bee sent over to pacifie the King (who then was in Aquitaine) with these letters: <hi>Most puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Prince, and my dread Soveraigne, I came into this land with your Majesties leave and savour (as farre as I remember) to aide your ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Dermot Mac Morogh; what I have wonne, was with the sword, what is given me, I give you, I am yours, life and living at your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vpon the receit of these letters, there fell of all sides, three disasters, the King was mightily incensed against Earle <hi>Richard,</hi> and therefore delayed Sir <hi>Reimond Legrosse,</hi> and gave him no answer; secondly, the death of <hi>Thomas,</hi> Archbishop of Canterbury troubled him excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and to helpe the readers memory with the time, it was as the rime delivereth,
<q>
                        <l>Annus millenus, centenus septuagenus</l>

                  </p>
                  <p>The third was, that <hi>Dermot Mac Morogh</hi> a most bountifull Prince, died and was buried at Fernes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1171. <hi>Hastulpus,</hi> late Governour of Dublin (of whom I have formerly spoken) returneth, and entreth the haven of Dublin, with threescore saile to his aide, of Ilanders, Norwegians, and Esterlings, they forthwith landed, and unshipped themselves, and had to their Captaine, saith <hi>Cambrensis,</hi> one <hi>Iohn Wood,</hi> some call him mad <hi>Iohn,</hi> for the prankes he playd, for wood and mad beare one sense. <hi>Stani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurst</hi> calleth him <hi>Pewood, Douling, Heywood.</hi> They were all mighty men of warre, and well appointed after the Danish manner, being harnessed with good Brigandines, jackes and shirts of maile; their Shields, Bucklers, and Targets, were round, and coloured red, and bound about with iron, and as they seemed in armes, so were they no lesse in mindes; iron-strong and mighty; they marched in battaile array towards the East gate of the Citie. <hi>Miles Cogan</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, with a faire company (yet but a handfull to the number of the enemy, sallied forth, and gave them battaile, where both sides lost many a tall man. <hi>Miles Cogan</hi> seeing himselfe overlaid with the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rage and multitude of his adversaries, gave backe, and retired in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the towne; by this time, <hi>Richard Cogan</hi> his brother had secretly issued out with a good company, at the South posterne gate, compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Danes, and being at the foot of the rereward, made mighty
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:18659:142"/>
cry and shout, whereat the Danes were amazed, and the two bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren had the killing of them before and behinde. The Danes brake their array, threw their Armes away, fled towards their ships, where many also for haste were drowned. In this skirmish, <hi>Iohn Wood</hi> was slaine, and <hi>Hastulphus</hi> taken prisoner, and put to his ransome. The prodigalitie of this <hi>Hastulphus</hi> was such, that he contented not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with life, but braved and bragged of his exploits, in the hearing of <hi>Miles Cogan,</hi> and therewithall delivered, that that attempt was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but a taste or proofe of the Irish valour, and shortly, they should see another manner of forces assault them; <hi>What</hi> (saith <hi>Miles Cogan) is it not enough for him to have his life, but he must threaten us with further rebellion; goe, take him, and cut off his head.</hi> And thus the blabbe of his tongue, turned to his confusion.</p>
                  <p>Shortly after, the Irish and country birth, lying aloofe, wayting for all opportunities, and understanding of some unkindenesse and displeasure conceived by King <hi>Henry</hi> the second, against Earle <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> and in that quarrell generally against all the Britaines and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders of Ireland; they put their heads together, they plot, they draw their draughts and devices, to lay siege to recover the Citie of Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, and the chiefest instrument was <hi>Laurence O Toole,</hi> Archbishop of Dublin, who wrote unto <hi>Roderic,</hi> King of Connaght, &amp; unto <hi>Gotred, alias Godfrey,</hi> King of Man, and to all the Princes of Ireland, that it would please them (some in regard of neighbourhood, othersome in regard of naturall affection unto their native soile and distressed coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try men of Irish birth) put to their helping hand, ioyne their forces together, lay siege to the Citie of Dublin by sea and by land, relieve their brethren, rid them from the Britaines hands, and restore them to their former liberty. The Bishop for the good opinion that was held of his learning, gravitie, and sanctitie, prevailed, insomuch, that <hi>Gotred,</hi> King of Man, came into the harbour of Dublin, with thirty saile. <hi>Roderic</hi> the Monarch and forces of Ireland came by land, and incamped within sight of the towne. Within the towne, were Earle <hi>Richard Strangbow, Maurice Fitz Gerald, Reimond Legrosse,</hi> lately ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from out of England, <hi>Miles Cogan, Richard Cogan,</hi> with other worthy men and Citizens, to the number of thirty thousand fighting men. As they were prepared for battaile, (as commonly one mischiefe falleth in the necke of another) <hi>Donald,</hi> the base sonne of <hi>Dermot Mac Morogh,</hi> came in post to the Earle, and delivered how that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Fitz Stephens</hi> in his Fort of Carreck by Wexford, was besieged with three thousand men of Wexford and Kinsele, by the conduct of <hi>Donald,</hi> Prince of Limeric, sonne in law to <hi>Dermot Mac Morogh,</hi> who before time in his extremity, and in the warres betweene him and <hi>Roderic</hi> the Monarch, for chiefery, (at the request of <hi>Dermot Mac Morogh,</hi> was relieved by <hi>Robert Fitz Stephens,</hi> and so aided, that he foiled his enemy; and thus good is recompenced with evill. In
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:18659:143"/>
this perplexitie and doubtfull danger, <hi>Maurice Fitz Gerald</hi> full of courage, turneth him to the Earle, and the martiall men in these words: you most valiant men, wee came not into this land, neither were we procured hither to be idle, or to live deliciously, but to try fortune, and to seeke adventures; wee stood sometime upon the top of the wheele, and the game went of our side, now mee thinkes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune wheeles about, let us not be dismaid, for that which is low now, will be up againe, and so we must tarry and take our time; such is the mutability among the sonnes of men, the fickle and uncertaine course of humane causes, so that prosperitie and adversitie, enterchangeably doe follow the one after the other. After day, commeth the night, and when the night is passed, the day dawneth againe; the sunne ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, and spreads his beames over the face of the earth, holdeth his course to his fall, passeth the night season, and riseth againe; we who before this time have made great triumphs, and had the wings of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to flye withall, and are now clowded and inclosed by our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies on every side, our victuals are scant, the King our Soveraigne Lord frowneth upon us, we are barred of release by sea and by land, our friends cannot helpe us, our enemies are ready to devoure us: plucke up your hearts, if God be with us, we care not who is against us; but alas my brother <hi>Fitz Stephens,</hi> whose valiantnesse, and noble enterprise brake the yce, and made way for us into this Iland, is now shut up in a weake hold, and feeble place, with wife and children, too weake and slender to keepe out so great a force. O trayterous <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nald</hi> of Limiric, O trecherous and halfe-hearted people of Kensele and Wexford! peace is war, trust is trechery, and truth is falshood among them: why then doe we tarry, why doe we linger? is there any hope of reliefe from our native soile? no, no, the matter is now otherwise, and we our selves are presently in a worse case, for as our nation at this present is odious and hatefull unto the Irish men, so are we also mis-led with some disgrace in our country, wherefore in so much as fortune favoureth the forward and couragious, and discoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the dastard and faint-hearted, while our wits are fresh, while our bodies are able, while wee are all on heart, let us give the on-set; though we are not so many in number as they are, our courage and valour is knowne to exceed theirs, they are but naked wretches, and unarmed people. <hi>Reimonà Legrosse</hi> immediately breaketh out in these speeches. My Vncle <hi>Maurice</hi> hath gravely delivered his minde, he hath pithily advised us, and prudently councelled us: this is no time to sit in councell, to spend time in speeches, or to use delayes, the danger is at hand, the enemy is at the doore, wee are compassed by sea and by land, there is no flying, we must fight it out; our provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is spent, England dares releeve us no more, Ireland defieth us, the Kings Maiestie (I know) dispraiseth not our activities, and yet gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth not our successes; he discommendeth not our valour, yet envieth

all our glory, though in words he reporteth well of our service, yet in deeds secretly hindereth the course thereof; lastly, he feareth that which we meant not, and doubteth of that which we thinke not of; wherefore all doubts and delaies set apart, let us, as becometh men of our sort, try the course of fortune, and proue the force of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; let that appeare unto them which is knowne unto us; of what race we came, and of what stock wee are discended. <hi>Camber</hi> the first King of Cambria our native Country, was our Ancestor, and the sonne of that Noble <hi>Brutus,</hi> the first and sole Monarch of Brittaine, whose Ancestor was <hi>Troos,</hi> the founder of that most antient City of Troy, who descended from <hi>Dardanus</hi> the son of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> from whom is derived unto us, not onely the stemme of antient Nobility, but also a certaine naturall inclination of valiant minds, and couragious stomachs resolutely to follow all exploits of prowesse and chivalry; and shall we now like sluggarts, degenerate from so noble a race, and like a sort of Cowards, be afraid of these naked and unarmed Raskals, in whom there is no valour, by reason of knowledge or experience in Armes? Shall such a rable of savages pinne us up within the wals of little Dublin? When in times past all the Princes in Greece kept warres the space of ten yeeres and odde months, against our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors in the famous City of Troy; and could not preuaile against them, untill they used treasons, and practised treacheries which bred unto them a more infamous victory, then a glorious Triumph? Let it never be said, that the blood of the Trojans shall be stained in our pusillanimity, and receive reproach by our peevish dastardy: Fortune, though she be pourtraied to be blind, as ever void of right judgement, and to stand upon a rolling stone, as being alwaies flitting and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constant; yet for the most part, shee helpeth such as be of couragious minds, &amp; valiant stomachs; you wil say, we are but a few, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my infinit in number; what then? Victory consisteth not in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, neither conquest in numbers: Did not <hi>Thomiris</hi> the <hi>Scythian</hi> Queene, with hundreds, overthrow <hi>Cyrus</hi> with thousands, and tooke him and slew him? Did not <hi>Laomedes</hi> the Spartane encounter (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but foure thousand Souldiers) with mighty <hi>Xerxes,</hi> who brought five hundred thousand to the field, and overthrew him? Did not <hi>Alexander</hi> with a few Macedonians ouerthrew <hi>Darius,</hi> the great Monarch of Persia? Did not he take him, his wife, and daughters prisoners, and make a Conquest of Persia? Have not wee in our persons (all praise be given to God, the giver of Victory) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven you, right honorable Earle at Waterford, my uncle <hi>Fitz Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phens</hi> at Wexford, my selfe at Dondorogh with a few given many the foile; what remains, sith time shall sooner faile then matter want? let us like men shew resolute minds in this service. And to conclude, my mind then and opinion is, that we doe issue out upon them as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly and as suddenly as we may, and give the onset.</p>

                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:18659:144"/>And for so much as <hi>Roderic</hi> of Conoght, is the generall of the field, in whom lyeth the chiefest force, and on whom all the rest doe chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly depend, it shall be best to begin with him, and if we can giue him the overthrow, all the rest will flie, and we shall obtaine a glorious victorie; but if we shall fall into their hands and be slaine, yet shall we leave an honorable report and an immortall fame to our posteritie. He had no sooner ended his speech, but every man armed himselfe to goe forth, and give the onset: They divided the Army in three bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailes; and although at the first, they contended for the Vanguard, yet quickly they were accorded and marched forward. <hi>Reimond le Grosse</hi> resolutely given, with twenty Knights, and souldiers well ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, tooke the Vanguard. <hi>Miles Cogan</hi> with thirty Knights, and many a worthy warriour, kept the maine battaile. Earle <hi>Strangbow,</hi> and <hi>Maurice Fitz Gerald,</hi> with fourty Knights, Gentlemen and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon souldiers, took the Rereward, in every ward were placed some of the Citizens, and other some with martiall men, left at home for the guard and safety of the City: early in the morning when the enemy was unarmed &amp; out of order, little thinking that so few within durst attempt to give the onset to so many without, they fell upon them, killed without mercy, and the rere was so forward, that they came with the Vanguard by wheeling about to the slaughter of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie. <hi>Roderic</hi> all this while trusting to his troupes and multitude of people, feared nothing, he took his ease and pleasure, and was bathing himself; but when the larum was up, &amp; that he saw his men on every side fall to the ground, never tarried, called for man nor Page to array him, but tooke his mantle and ranne away all naked, and hardly esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with life. The Britaines pursued after, and had the killing of them all that day, in the evening they returned into the Citie, not onely with the honour of the field, but rich booties, and praies of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, armour and other pillage, as much as man and beast could cary: Immediatly, also the rumor hereof, the other Campes were dispersed, namely, <hi>Laurence</hi> the Archbishop (whom it had beseemed better to have beene at home with his porthouse, then in Campe with rebels) <hi>Mathelan Machalem, Gillemehelmocus, Otuetol, Ororic</hi> Prince of Meath, <hi>Ocarol, alias Ocarvell</hi> Prince of Vriell, <hi>Machfalin, Ochadese,</hi> with many other great Commanders, where every man shifted for himselfe; of <hi>Gotred, alias Godfray</hi> King of Man that came by Sea, I find nothing, for upon this disaster he tooke him to the seas the next day, without any further deliberation; <hi>Miles Cogan</hi> is left to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne Dublin, and the Earle with his Army marched towards Wex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, to raise the siege at the Carreke, to relieve <hi>Robert Fitz Stephens</hi>; as he passed by Odrone, the forces of Leinster, by the conduct of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nole Obrene</hi> Prince of Limerik, and <hi>Donald Prince Osery</hi> set upon him, and fought a cruell fight, but he went on with the losse of one man. As he came to the borders of Wexford, certaine messengers
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:18659:144"/>
met and informed him of the mischance that happened to <hi>Robert Fitz Stephens,</hi> and the firing of the Towne of Wexford; adding more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that the Wexfordians were fully determined, if the Earle came any further towards them, they would cut off all the heads of <hi>Fitz Stephens</hi> and all his company, and send them unto him; whereupon with heavy cheere and sorrowfull heart he changed his mind &amp; tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Waterford. But afore I proceede any further, I am to deliver the manner of the treachery and villany shewed unto <hi>Robert Fitz Stephens: Donold</hi> of Limric, sonne in Law to <hi>Dermot Mac Morogh,</hi> while his father lived, he was one that favoured the Brittains, and not without cause; but now forgetting humanity returneth to his vomit, bends his course towards Wexford, and while other states of Ireland by East and by North, with might &amp; maine practised the rooting out of the Brittains, he flies to the South, and raiseth Wexford, &amp; Kensile to lay siege to the Carreke, the fort of <hi>Robert Fitz Stephens.</hi> First they begin with force, and seeing that failed them, they fall to guiles and subtilities under color of peace, pretending nothing but pure love, tender affection and safeguard of his person, and all that were with him; they bring with them two Bishops, the one of Kildare, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Fernes, in their formall moods, with other Religious persons (O damned Prelats) and they had with them the Masse Booke, the host, with certaine Reliques; upon these they take corporall oathes, and sweare with great solemnity and protestations as followeth: (<hi>For the good will and affection wee beare unto you</hi>) whom we have alwaies found a curteous and bountifull Prince, we are to signifie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you this much; how that Dublin is taken, <hi>the Earle Strangbow, Maurice Fitz Girald, Reimond le Grosse, Miles Cogan,</hi> with all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish are put to the sword, and now <hi>Roderic</hi> the Monarch, with all the power of Conoght and Leinster posteth hither to rase even with the ground, all the Forts, Holds, and Castles, which the English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have, and especially to apprehend you <hi>Robert Fitz Stephens,</hi> and <hi>Willam Not,</hi> that were the forerunners into this Land of all this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe; wherefore take this for truth and be well advised what to doe, if they take you there is no mercy; if you will put your selfe with your company and goods into our hands, in the faith of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty we sweare we will safely transport you and yours unto Wales, so shall you not lose so much as a haire of your head; wherefore the great Army being at hand, yeeld, come forth and shippe your selfe for Wals. <hi>Robert Fitz Stephens</hi> (who would not in this case give credit) yeelded himselfe into their hands, immediatly (more like Iewes then Christians) they strippe them out of all that ever they have, they hang one, they throw another over a rocke, they breake anothers necke, one hath his eyes puld out, another hath his tongue cut, some they scourge with thongs, other some they take, and with sledges breake their Armes and thighes, the greatest kindnesse they
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18659:145"/>
shew is iron and imprisonment, the which <hi>Robert Fitz Stephens</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured; now leaving these bloody Massacers and themselves, I will turne to Waterford after Earle <hi>Strangbow.</hi> When Earle <hi>Strangbow</hi> came to Waterford, he found there <hi>Hervie de Monte Marisco</hi> new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arrived out of England, with letters from the King, requiring him forthwith to repaire unto his Majesty. <hi>Strangbow</hi> together with <hi>Hervy</hi> tooke the first wind and went for England, and found the King at Newham not farre from Glocester, where he was in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse with a great Army to saile out into Ireland, whereafter sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry altercations passed betweene them, at length (as they say) by meanes of <hi>Hervy,</hi> the Kings displeasure was appeased, and it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that the Earle should sweare alleageance to the King, and yeeld and surender unto him the City of Dublin, with the Cantreds there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto adjoining, as also such Townes and Forts as were bordering upon the Sea side, and as for the residue he should have and reteine to him and his heires, holding the same of the King and his heires.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Strangbow</hi> was no sooner knowne to be in England, and <hi>Reimond</hi> at Waterford, but <hi>Ororic Monoculus,</hi> the one eyed Prince of Meath, mustred a great number of Souldiers, and laid siege to the City of Dublin. <hi>Miles Cogan</hi> the Governour withall his company (while the enemy was carelesse) upon a sudden issued out and fell upon them unawares, and made a great slaughter of them, among whom both <hi>Ororic</hi> and his sonne were slaine.</p>
                  <p>In the British Chronicles copied by <hi>Owen Cretten</hi> out of the Abbies of Conwey in North-wales, and <hi>Stratflur</hi> in South-wales, I find re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded that when King <hi>Henry</hi> the 2. made preparation for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of Ireland, <hi>Richard Strangbow</hi> Earle of Strigale, Marshall of England, being reconciled to the King, had all his Lands in England and Normandy restored unto him againe, and thereupon the King made him Seneschall (Steward, saith he, of Ireland) Then came <hi>Rees</hi> prince of South-wales, and offred the King to further his Conquest, 300. Horses, 400. Oxen, and for performance of all services gave him 14. pledges; when they were presented the King made choice of 30. principall Horses, gave backe all the rest, confessing himselfe greatly pleasured at his hands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1172. upon Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> day the 18. of <hi>October, Henry</hi> the 2. the 17. yeere of his raigne, the 41. of his age, entred the Haven of Waterford so writeth <hi>Cambrensis</hi> that lived then, and being landed to the harty joy of the English, and fained welcome of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishmen, had by them of Wexford formerly spoken of, <hi>Robert Fitz Stephens</hi> in irons presented before him, whom the Wexfordians (herein I commend <hi>Stanihursts</hi> indifferent dealing) rather of malice &amp; cankard spight, then for just cause, did charge with many hainous crimes. The King advisedly to pacifie the rage of furious people, for
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:18659:145"/>
for the present time, committed him to prison, whence shortly after, he was with honour and credit, discharged, and advanced to his great preferment.</p>
                  <p>After that the King had a little rested himselfe, and the messengers scattered themselves with newes over the land, the Princes were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, they knew the Kings greatnesse was such, if faire meanes would not, force should constraine them, and therefore in policie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved themselves to yeeld allegiance, homage and fealtie. Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Dermot Mac Carty,</hi> Prince of Corke, began, became tributarie, sware faith, truth, and loyaltie to the King of England. And the King thereupon gave the kingdome of Corke to <hi>Robert Fitz Stephens</hi> and <hi>Miles Cogan</hi> as hereafter more at large shall appeare.</p>
                  <p>From Waterford the King raised his army, and marched towards Lismore, where he tarryed two daies, and from thence he marched to Cashill, not farre from the Shure, and thither came to him, <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nald O Bren,</hi> Prince of Limric, who submitted himselfe, became tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butarie, and swore fealty; whereupon the King as hee had formerly done with Corke, appointed a Governour for Limric: then also came in <hi>Donall,</hi> Prince of Ossorie, and <hi>Omelaghlen Ophelin,</hi> Lord of the Decies, with all the chieftaines of Mounster, submitting themselves, as others had formerly done, surrendring unto the Kings hands, their territories, and holding them againe at his pleasure. Thence the King returned to Waterford, left there his houshold, and <hi>Robert Fitz Barnard,</hi> governour of the towne, and marched with his army to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Dublin. In his iourney there came unto him of the chiefest commanders of the land, <hi>Omathelan, Machelan, Ophelan, O Mac Chel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weie, Gille Mac Holemoc, O tuell helly Ocathdhessy, O Caraell</hi> of Vriell, and <hi>Roric</hi> the sonne of <hi>Monoculus</hi> of Meth. But <hi>Roderic</hi> the Monarch came no neerer then the Shanon, where <hi>Hugh de lacy,</hi> and <hi>William Fitz Aldelme,</hi> by the Kings command met him, and hee desiring peace, submitted himselfe, swore allegiance, became tributarie, and did put in (as all others had done) hostages and pledges for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the same. Thus was all Ireland, saving Vlster, brought in subjection, and every Prince of the other parties, in his owne person, saving <hi>Roderic</hi> King of Connaght, submitted himselfe: but he subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alledged, that he submitted Connaght, but not the command of all Ireland, the which he reserved for the Monarch and his successors: but of this hereafter if God permit.</p>
                  <p>Christmas drew on, which the King kept at Dublin, where hee feasted all the Princes of the land, and gave them rich and beautifull gifts, they repaired thither out of all parts of the land, and wonderfull it was to the rude people to behold the Majestie of so puissant a Prince, the pastime, the sport, and the mirth, and the continuall mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, the masking, mumming, and strange shewes, the gold, the sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and plate, the precious ornaments, the dainty dishes, furnished
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:18659:146"/>
with all sorts of fish and flesh, the wines, the spices, the delicate and sumptuous banquets, the orderly service, the comely march, and seemly array of all officers: the Gentlemen, the Esquires, the Knights, and Lords in their rich attire (such as rugged Mantles and Irish Troosses were never acquainted withall) the running at Tilte in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat harnesse, with barb'd horses, where the staves shivered and flew in splinters, safer to sit, then upon an Irish Pillion that playeth crosse and pile with the rider, the plaine honest people admired, and no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile: but now to more serious matters. <hi>Henry</hi> 2. having thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Ireland (with the envy of the French and forraigne Princes) without one drop of sweat, without drawing of sword, or shedding of one drop of English bloud, (as it became his Princely calling) tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himselfe to reforme the state Ecclesiasticall, and the misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of holy Church, whereof <hi>Cambrensis</hi> writeth: <hi>In the yeere of Christs incarnation</hi> 1172. <hi>and in the first yeere, when</hi> Henry <hi>the most Noble King conquered Ireland,</hi> Christianus, <hi>Bishop of Lismore, and Legate of the Apostolike See</hi>; Donatus, <hi>Archbishop of Cashill</hi>; Laure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <hi>Archbishop of Dublin; and</hi> Catholi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At this Councell, in behalfe of the King, (whom he had sent thither) there were</hi> Raffe, <hi>Abbot of Buldeway,</hi> Raffe, <hi>Archdeacon of Landaffe,</hi> Nicholas, <hi>the Kings Chaplaine, with divers other Clerkes; sundry good statutes and wholesome lawes were there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised, which were after subscribed and confirmed by the King himselfe, and under his authority, which were these that follow.</hi>

                     <hi>Gelasius,</hi> Primate of Armagh, was not at this Synod, but at his comming to Dublin, hee concurred with his Collegues, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the premises. He was a man of great learning, godly life, and great age; when by reason of age, sight, and strength, and stomacke failed him, as he travailed, he had with him alwaies, a white Cow that gave him milke, and was his onely sustentation. <hi>Gilbert</hi> succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this <hi>Gelasius</hi> in that See. The Antiquaries of that time have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, that the winter during the Kings abode in Ireland, there rose such stormes and tempest by sea and by land, that no newes could be heard either out of England or Normandie, neither Shippe or Barke crosse the seas, untill mid-Lent, at what time with an easterly winde, there came out of England, and Aquitaine in France, newes unto the King, how that there came into Normandy in France, two Cardinals from <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, to wit, <hi>Albertus</hi> and <hi>Theodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> to enquire of the death of <hi>Thomas,</hi> Archbishop of Canterbury:
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:18659:147"/>
Whereupon the King sent in post before him, to signifie that he was returning with all speede, and that he would conferre with them in Normandie. And leaving Ireland, hee was very sorry that time and leisure served not to lay things in better order for the stay of the land. And also suspecting the greatnesse of <hi>Richard,</hi> Earle <hi>Strangbow,</hi> whom at that time he tooke with him into England; hee appointed to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne Dublin, <hi>Hugh de Lacy,</hi> to whom he had given in Fee, the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorie of Meth, with twenty Gentlemen to his Guard. <hi>Robert Fitz Stephens,</hi> and <hi>Morice Fitz Girald,</hi> with twenty others to attend their persons. Likewise he left Governours over Waterford, <hi>Humfrey de Bohune, Robert Fitz Bernard,</hi> and <hi>Hugh de Graunt devil</hi> with forty persons to their guard. Lastly, hee assigned over Wexford, <hi>William Fitz Adelme, Philip de Bruesa,</hi> and <hi>Philip de Hastings,</hi> with twenty to their guard, and tooke shipping at Wexford, Munday in Easter weeke, by sixe a clocke in the morning, with full saile, and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the same day about noone, at Saint <hi>Davids</hi> in Wales; so writeth <hi>Cambrensis</hi> in his vaticinall historie, and in his Itinerarie of Cambria. What time the King was in Ireland, there fell a great plague in his army, which was some cause of his departure from Dublin to Wex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. <hi>Cambrensis</hi> out of the mouth of the common people, attributeth it unto certaine Archers, cessed at Finglas, that cut downe the trees of the Church-yard, and therefore were they iustly punished, and left their bones there every one; but the British Chronicle, and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linshed</hi> also, more likely to be true, affirmeth that there fell a plague a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Kings souldiers in Ireland, by reason of the change of the ayre, and victuals, and concourse of people, corrupting the same.</p>

                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:18659:149"/>Not long after the Kings departure out of Ireland, <hi>Ororic</hi> of Meth craved a parlee, with <hi>Hughe Delacy</hi>; pretending reformation of abuses, and establishing of perfect love and amity; but meant no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else, saving falshood, treason and villany: the place being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed (<hi>Cambrensis</hi> calleth it <hi>Ororics</hi> Hill, I take it to be the Hill of <hi>Taragh</hi>) and oathes taken of each side, with conditions that all armes should be laid aside, and few persons approach to the place, <hi>Ororic</hi> contrary to the covenants, laid an ambush, that upon a signe or token given by him, they should forth with issue out of the bushes, and ditches, and effect his traiterous devices: The night before the parly, <hi>Griffith</hi> the nephew of <hi>Robert</hi> and <hi>Morice,</hi> being the sonne of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the elder brother, dreamed in his sleepe, that he saw a great heard of wild hogges, rush upon <hi>Hugh Delacy,</hi> and his uncle <hi>Maurice,</hi> and that one of them being more furious and raging then the rest, had rent them with his tuskes, and tore them in pieces, if he had not with his force rescued them, and killed the Bore: this dreame trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him exceedingly, wherewith he acquainted his company; and made him and the rest be the more upon their keeping, to prevent treachery: The houre of parlee came, they met and confered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Griffith</hi> not forgetting his dreame, made choice of seven tall men of his owne kindred, in whom he reposed great trust and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, well mounted, with swords, sparthes, and sheilds; raunged the fields (as nigh the Hill as they might) and made sundry Carreers and brave Turnaments, under pretence of recreation and pleasant pastime; yet alwaies casting an eye to the Hill, to see the end of this parlee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hughe Delacy</hi> and <hi>Ororic,</hi> being somewhat long together, <hi>Ororic</hi> to worke his treason, stept aside, faining to make water, upon the signe he gave his men brought him his horse, and sparth, the which he taking upon his shoulder, ment therewith to have cloven <hi>Hughe Delacy</hi> his head, if the interpreter had not stept betweene, whose arme was cleane cut off and himselfe wounded to the death.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Maurice Fitz Girald</hi> and <hi>Griffith</hi> his nephew rush in, the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of the one side, the true men of the other are together by the eares; when <hi>Ororic</hi> the traitor tooke horse to runne away, <hi>Griffith</hi> with his launce runne him through, and killed him and his horse and three of his men, cut off his head and sent it to the King of England: this was the end of <hi>Orirics</hi> treason, and the effect of <hi>Griffiths</hi> dreame.</p>
                  <p>Immediatly upon this, Earle <hi>Richard</hi> (being formerly upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation made with the King, appointed Seneschall of Ireland) is now sent out of Normandy, by especially commission from the King, with <hi>Reimondle grosse</hi> his brother in Law, in joint commission to governe the whole land, &amp; to be his Lieutenant in Ireland; where he found the Irish saith <hi>Cambrensis,</hi> constant in inconstancy, firme in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:18659:150"/>
wavering, and faithfull in untruthes: he found emulation betweene <hi>Hervy</hi> and <hi>Reimond,</hi> and the Army in a mutiny, for lacke of pay at <hi>Herveies</hi> hands; whereupon he made <hi>Reimond</hi> Lievetenant of the forces. <hi>Reimond</hi> immediatly mustred his men, drew them forth to the Decies among the Rebels, where they preyed and spoiled. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they marched to Lismore, where they did the like. Lastly, along the Sea cost, they goe with their booties, preyes and rich pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage towards Waterford; and finding at Dunganan some thirteene botes out of Waterford and other places, they lade them with their preys, intending by water to saile for Waterford; while they waited for wind, Corke men envyed their successe; prepared 32. Barks, manned and furnished them out out of their Towne, to overthrow <hi>Reimond</hi> and the English men, and to recover the preyes; they met, they fought cruelly; Corke men are overthrowne, and their Captain <hi>Gilbert Mac Turger</hi> was slaine, by a valiant Knight <hi>Philip Welsh,</hi> and finally <hi>Adam Herford</hi> with all his charge, safely arrived in Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. <hi>Reimond</hi> was not at this skirmish, but by the way he met with <hi>Dermot Mac Corty</hi> Prince of Desmond, who with great power was come to the aid of the men of Corke. They likewise skrimished and fell to a cruell fight, where <hi>Dermot</hi> forsooke the field with small cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and <hi>Reimond</hi> went to Waterford with foure thousand head of cattell.</p>
                  <p>Immediatly upon this, newes came out of England unto <hi>Reimond,</hi> that <hi>William Fitz Girald</hi> his father, was departed this life; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he sailed to Wales, and <hi>Hervey De monte Marisco</hi> was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Earle, Lieutenant of the forces. This <hi>Hervey</hi> to advance his credit, purposed to worke some exploits, and drew out of Dublin the Earle to Cashil; there also after consultation by mandat from the Earle, he appointed the Souldiers that were at Dublin to meet him: When they came as farre as Ossorie, <hi>Donald</hi> Prince of Limirik, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by his espials before hand intelligence thereof, stole upon them in the morning; slue of them foure Knights, whereof <hi>O Grame</hi> an Irish man was one, and foure hundred souldiers; with this the Earle was discouraged, and went to Waterford; the Irish gathered heart and determined to roote out al the Englishmen. So that <hi>Roderic</hi> Prince of Conoght tooke this opportunity, passed the Shannan, and wasted all to the walles of Dublin. The Earle being in this perplexity wrote unto <hi>Reimond,</hi> that was in Wales. <hi>As soone as you have read those our letters, make all the haste you can to come away, and bring with you all the helpe and force you can make, and then accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your own will and desire, you shall assuredly enjoy that which you long looked for.</hi> Immediatly he prepared himselfe, together with his cousin <hi>Meilerius</hi>; shipped 30. young Gentlemen of his own kindred. 100. horsemen, with 300. archers &amp; foot, of the best &amp; chosen men of all Wales; and in 20. Barkes arrived in Waterford: It was at such time
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:18659:150"/>
as the Waterford men had determined to kill every English man within the walles; but when they saw the Barkes come in with flags, and banners displaid, they were astonied, and staid their course.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reimond</hi> entreth the towne of Wexford, setteth all in order, taketh the Earle with him, and all their forces, and went to Wexford; hee had left behinde him one <hi>Purcell</hi> his Lievetenant to guard the town, whom the Waterfordians slue, and put to the sword, of English birth, man, woman and childe; but such as had fled to <hi>Reynolds</hi> towre, plagued them sore afterwards, drove them to intreate for peace, the which they obtained with hard conditions: And, saith the booke of <hi>Houth,</hi> the Waterfordians were ever after the lesse beleeved. For all the troubles in England and Normandie, and these treasons and rebellions in Ireland, the King was not unmindefull to quiet the people, and to establish himselfe and his heires in the kingdome; first, he sent Embassadors to Rome to cleere himselfe of the death of <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> of Canterbury: secondly, he sent messengers thither concerning the state of Ireland, whereunto <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, answered as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, <hi>Alexander the Bishop, the servant of the servants of God,</hi> to his dearely beloved sonne, the Noble King of England, greeting, grace and Apostolike benediction. Forasmuch as things given and granted upon good reason, by our predecessors, are to be well allowed of, rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and confirmed; wee well considering and pondering the graunt and priviledge for and concerning the dominion of the land of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to us appertaining, and lately given by <hi>Adrian</hi> our predecessor; we following his steps, doe in like manner confirme, ratifie and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the same, reserving and saving to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and to the Church of Rome, the yeerely pension of one penny out of every house, as well in England, as in Ireland; provided also that the barbarous peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Ireland by your meanes be reformed and recovered from that filthy life, and abhominable conversation; that as in name, so in life and manners they may be Christians; and that as that rude and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered Church, being by you reformed, the whole nation may also, with the profession of the name, be in acts and deeds, followers of the same. And saith the booke of <hi>Houth, Alexander</hi> the third be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sought the devill to take them all that gainesayed this Kings title, <hi>Amen. Henry</hi> 2. sent this priviledge to Ireland by <hi>Nicholas Walling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> a Prior, afterwards Abbot of Malmesbury, and <hi>William Fitz Adelme.</hi> And then being at Waterford, they caused an assembly, and a Synod of the Bishops and Clergie within the land to be gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, where, in open audience, this priviledge of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and the other of <hi>Adrian</hi> (formerly spoken of) were read, and published, and ratified. <hi>Reimond</hi> having setled his affaires at Wexford, marched towards Dublin, the noyse of his comming drave <hi>Roderic</hi> the rebell of Connaght away; he was no sooner come to Dublin, but the newes of the rebellion of Limric followed after, where <hi>Donald O bren</hi>
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:18659:151"/>
having sworne faith and fealty unto <hi>Henry</hi> 2. is now revolted and turned to his vomit. <hi>Reymond</hi> maketh preparation, mustereth his men, chose out 26. gallants, 300. horsemen, and 300. Archers, and foote, and commeth to Lymeric, where he found the Bridges drawn, the river swift and impassable, the townesmen upon the walls, with all manner of defence for their safeguard. <hi>David Welsh,</hi> a lusty Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, maketh no more adoe, but putteth spurres to his horse, and with good guiding thereof, crosseth the river, and got to land; imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately he calleth to his company, come, I have found a Ford: yet for all that, none would follow, but <hi>Ieffery Welsh,</hi> and <hi>Meilerius Fitz Henry.</hi> Then <hi>Reimond</hi> turneth him to the army with these words: <hi>You worthy men, who of nature are valiant, and whose Prowesse we have well tryed, come away, the way heretofore not knowne, and the river hitherto thought not passable, by our adventures, a foord is now found therein; let us therefore follow him that is gone before, and helpe him being now in distresse; let us not suffer nor see so worthy a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man thus for our common cause and honour, oppressed, to perish, and to be cast away before our eyes, and in our sight, for want of our help, and by meanes of our dastard cowardize. It is no time to use many words, the shortnesse of the time, the present necessitie of this Noble Gentleman, and the state of our own honour, urgeth expedition, and requireth haste.</hi> And even with the words, he put spurres to his horse, and adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the river, after whom, followed the whole company, every one striving who might be formost. And as God would, they passed all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver safe, saving two souldiers, and one <hi>Gwydo</hi> a Gentleman: when they had recovered land, the enemy fled, whom they pursued, and in the chase slue a number of them, they entred the towne, got great spoyles and riches, but greater honour and fame. When all was quiet, <hi>Reimond</hi> left there a strong Garrison, and <hi>Miles</hi> of Saint <hi>Davids,</hi> Lievetenant over them, and returned to the borders of Leinster.</p>
                  <p>Envy hardly sleepeth, but is still devising of mischiefe; <hi>Hervie de monte Marisco,</hi> though now by marriage allyed unto <hi>Reymond,</hi> yet by malice worketh his overthrow, enuying his honour and prosperous successe, sendeth secret letters to the King against him, which are not worthy to be recorded, being but the sinke of secret malice. The King, (as the nature of Princes is to be jealous and suspitious of any great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) is easily brought to credit <hi>Hervie,</hi> and thereupon sendeth foure of his servants to Ireland, <hi>Robert Poer, Osbert</hi> of Herlotte, or Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, <hi>William Bendeger,</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> of Gernemie; two of them to stay with Earle <hi>Richard,</hi> and the other two to bring <hi>Reimond</hi> away with them; as <hi>Reymond</hi> was ready to goe for England, newes came that <hi>Donald,</hi> Prince of Lymeric had besieged the towne, and that the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison was greatly distressed, and in want of victuals: the Earle, with <hi>Reimond</hi> and the foure Gentlemen, fell to consultation, what course to hold; they found in the army a secret mutiny, where the souldiers
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:18659:151"/>
said flatly, they would not serve that way, unlesse <hi>Reimond</hi> were their Captaine; to be short, it was concluded that <hi>Reimond</hi> should under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the service; when he had mustered and made choice of horse and foot, he marched towards Lymeric: <hi>Donald,</hi> Prince of Ossory, who bore private grudge to <hi>Donald</hi> of Lymeric, <hi>Morogh</hi> of Kencile, with other Irish men, then served and attended upon <hi>Reimond.</hi> By the way a Post came, and certified <hi>Reimond,</hi> that <hi>Donald</hi> of Lymeric had raised his siege, and was come to the pace of Cashill to give him bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile; this pace of it selfe was naturally very strong, but by trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hedging, and plashing of trees, it seemed invincible. When of each side they were ready to joyne battaile, <hi>Donald,</hi> Prince of Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sory being desirous to see his enemy of Lymeric and Thomond o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrowne, turneth him to the English men with these words: <hi>You worthy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Noble, and valiant Conquerours of this land, you are this day valiantly to give the onset upon your enemies, which if you doe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your old and accustomed manner, no doubt the victory will be yours; for we with our sparthes, and you with your swords, will sharpely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue them, as they shall very hardly escape our hands, &amp; avoid our force, but if it so fall out (which God forbid) that you be overthrowne, and hove the worse side, be you assured that wee will leave you, and turne to our enemies, and take part with them. Wherefore be of good courage, and looke well to your selves, and consider that you are now farre from any Fort or place of refuge, and therefore if you should be driven to flye, the same will be long and dangerous unto you. As for us, ye may not trust to us, for we determine to sticke to them who shall have the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and will pursue and be on the jackes of them who shall flye and runne away: and therefore be no longer assured of us, then whilst yee be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours: Meilerius,</hi> who had the foreward, being somewhat mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and warmed with those words, suddenly, like a blast of winde, entred the Passe, pulled away the bushes, brake downe the hedges, the Pioners filled the trenches, and speedily made plaine the way, with no small slaughter of the enemies, and so they marched with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great perill to Lymeric, where they releeved the army, and set things in order, and rested a short time. <hi>Roderic</hi> of Connaght, and <hi>Donald</hi> of Thomond finding themselves weake, craved a parlee, it was granted them: <hi>Roderic</hi> would needs keepe on the water, and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nald</hi> kept the wood. Who would trust them that would trust no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? <hi>Reimond</hi> chose the midst betweene them both; to be short, a peace was concluded, they both submitted themselves, gave hosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, made fealtie, and swore to be true thenceforth for ever to the King of England, and to his successors after him. This service was no sooner performed, but there came messengers to <hi>Reimond</hi> from <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot Mac Carty</hi> Prince of <hi>Desmond,</hi> humbly craving his aide, against his eldest son <hi>Cormac O Lechan,</hi> who was in armes against his natural father: with the advice of his Councell; <hi>Reimond</hi> granteth aide, hee
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:18659:152"/>
marcheth towards Corke and subdueth the rebell, the sonne dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth with the father and clapt him in prison: the father requiteth the sonne with like: he got him in under colour of peace, clapt him in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and cut off his head.</p>
                  <p>And not long after, saith <hi>Cambrensis,</hi> the men of Corke at a parlee not farre from the Towne, slew their Prince <hi>Dermot Mac Carty,</hi> and most of his company.</p>

This Cardinall, saith mine Author, intitled <hi>Sancti Stephani de monte Celio,</hi> was sent from <hi>Alexander</hi> 3. and comming into England without licence, was pardoned by <hi>Henry</hi> 2. and permitted to goe into Scotland, and the north parts, where his commission directed him; when he had ended
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:18659:154"/>
his businesse in Scotland, he passed over into Man, where he held his Christmas with <hi>Gotred,</hi> King of Man, and after the Epiphanie, sailed from thence into Ireland, and came thither (saith <hi>Newbrigiensis</hi>) the same time that the English men invaded the country, and was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by <hi>Roderic,</hi> and the Bishop of Dune, and others, with great reverence.</p>
                  <p>The Irish men aske councell of <hi>Vivian</hi> the Legate, what in that case he thought best to be done, whether they should fight, or yeeld unto the English nation; he gave counsell, forgetting what <hi>Adrian</hi> 4. and <hi>Alexander</hi> 3. had formerly granted and said, <hi>fight in defence of your country.</hi> This Legate (craftily preventing all mishaps) took the Church of Dune for his sanctuary, and had in readinesse the Popes commission, and the King of Englands Passe unto the Captaines of Ireland for his safe conduct: From thence he went to Dublin, called the Prelates, held a councell, and filled his bagges with the sinnes of the people; the English Captaines understanding of it, gave him in charge, either to depart the land, or to goe to the warres, and serve for pay with them, and no longer to receive money for nought.</p>
                  <p>In the booke of <hi>Howth</hi> it is further alledged, how that this Legate in his Synod at Dublin (whether it were to curry favour with the English men, and to colour his other pranckes, it forceth not greatly) shewed and published openly the King of Englands right to Ireland, with the Popes grant and confirmation, and accursed all those that gainesaid the same.</p>

He was by father a Norman, by mother a Cambri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an or Britaine, and married the daughter of <hi>Gotred,</hi> King of Man; he was a Gentleman descended, as it seemeth by his coate, of an antient house, of whom the Irish men hold that <hi>Merlin</hi> prophecied, where he wrote: <hi>A white Knight sitting on a white horse, bearing birds in his shield, shall be the first which with force of Armes, shall enter and subdue Vlster.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He served King <hi>Henry</hi> the second in all his warres, and in France he met with a worthy Knight, Sir <hi>Amoricus Tristeram,</hi> who mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>Courcy</hi> his sister, and whether it was derived of the Ladies name,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:18659:154"/>
or for that they were married on Saint <hi>Laurence</hi> day, ever after hee and his posterity after him, was called Sir <hi>Amoricus de Sancto Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentio,</hi> whence the Noble house of <hi>Howth</hi> is lineally discended, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hereafter in another place more at large. These two Knights be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came sworne brethren in the Church of our Lady at Roane; where solemnely they vowed to serve together, to live and dye together and equally to devide betweene them what they wanne by the sword, or should be given them in regard of their service: Thus they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in France, Anjou, Normandy, and England; and when Sir <hi>Iohn de Courcy</hi> was joyned in commission with <hi>William Burgh Fitz Adelme</hi> and others; Sir <hi>Amoricus de Sancte Laurentia,</hi> accompanied him into Ireland, where <hi>Courcy</hi> receaved a graunt of the King, by Patent for him and his heires or assignes after him, to enjoy in that Land all that he could Conquer with the sword, reserving to the King homage and fealty; they landed at Houth and there fought a cruell fight by the side of a Bridge, where Sir <hi>Iohn de Courcy</hi> being sickly, taried abord the shippe. Sir <hi>Amoricus</hi> being Chiftaine and Generall of the field by land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> behaved himselfe most worthily; many were slaine on both sides, but Sir <hi>Amoricus</hi> got the victory, with the lose of seven of his owne blood, sonnes, uncles and nephewes, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon for his singular valour and good service there performed, that Lordship was allotted unto him for his part of the conquest, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things which Sir <hi>Iohn de Courcy</hi> gave him. Immediatly, Sir <hi>Iohn de Courcy,</hi> Sir <hi>Amoricus de Saint Laurence,</hi> and Sir <hi>Roger Hoer,</hi> so well appointed as then contented them, directed their course to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North; the principall cause that moved them (besides their valour) was the hard government of <hi>William Fitz Adelme,</hi> Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, whose conditions <hi>Cambrensis</hi> who then lived and was conversant with him, delivereth in this sort. He was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, proud, malicious, envious, a favorite of wine and women and good to none, but to his back and belly: and by his backe he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood his kindred, and by his belly he ment his children, for he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed himselfe, most enviously against the <hi>Garraldins, Fitz Stephens</hi> and <hi>Barries,</hi> the first most valiant Conquerors of the Land, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their posterity, &amp;c.</p>

He left this world to the great griefe of all the true harts in Ireland, and lieth buried in the Monastery of grey Friers without the wales of Wexford, his ..... sonnes whom <hi>William Fitz Adelme</hi> maligned, builded the Castle of Fernes. In his time, (saith <hi>Cambrensis</hi>) at Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo, where <hi>Maurice Fitz Girald</hi> dwelled, there was a Monster, begotten
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:18659:155"/>
by a wicked man of that nation upon a Cow, a vice (saith he) at that time too common among that nation. It had the body of a man, but all the hinder parts of an oxe, from the anckles of the legges, and the wrists of the armes, he had the hoofes of an oxe; his head was all bald saving a few small and thinne haires; his eyes, great, round, and blacke like an Oxe; nose he had none, but two holes; speake hee could not, but onely bellow like a Cow: this Monster did daily resort to the house of <hi>Maurice Fitz Girald</hi> about dinner time, and such meat as was given him, he tooke it in his hoofes, and put it to his mouth, and so fed himselfe.

within them. <hi>Odonell</hi> seeing the Horsmen to be but a few, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his foot and maine battaile to make a stand untill hee sent them word to march on, meaning to make short worke with the Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and so to breake the necke of the strength of the battaile; the Horsemen joyne battaile, the Archers gall <hi>Odonels</hi> horses with arrowes, whom the English launce slew not, the horse unsadled, and when the English quiver was empty, the archer with his sword haught the horses and dispatched the men that were unhorsed and cast to the ground. <hi>Odonels</hi> horsemen being somewhat discomfited retired, Sir <hi>Amoricus</hi> cals upon <hi>Courcy</hi> and <hi>Poer,</hi> to bring on the foote, who metting with the foote and maine battaile of the Irish (that expected newes from <hi>Odonell</hi>) fought most fiercely: No instrument of Warre could be heard, the cry of both sides pierced the clouds, the gald hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses grievously complained, the maimed souldiers groueling on the ground and gasping for breath gave pittifull groanes; the Irish flang darts and stones, the English shoote arrowes, the Irish with sparthes and galloglasse axes, the English with speares and swords encounter on both sides most valiantly; the splints of broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> staves fly about their eares, and eyes, sparkles of fire from their swords and targets, and the blowes upon their helmets yeelded the sound of hammers working upon anviles, both sides deserved honor and singular commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; the slaughter was great on both sides, and continued long; many of the English were slaine, and a number of the Irish were left alive, they determined to make an end of the English that day; the rere of the Irish march couragiously, the English had the bog of the one side, and the ditch of the other, and the entrance to them was ful of heads, legs, and armes, dead corps, armor and horses dead, and lying a long striving with death, that they could not approch, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they broke their battaile aray, dispersed themselves, and from the paces entred the plaines. Sir <hi>Amoric</hi> watching his opportunity, called <hi>Ieffrey Montgomery</hi> his sisters sonne and standard bearer, and said: <hi>Have not we quitted our selves like men this day, and shall wee dishonour the field so much as to suffer yonder company to escape our hands; come, advance your Standard, let us wheele about and give the on-set: Montgomery replied, it seemes strange unto mee, to see your stomach passe your strength, we have wonne honour advisedly, and shall we now rashly lose it? of seven score, we have but forty horses left, the rest are wounded, tired and not fit for service: then said Amorich give me the Standard, I will beare it my selfe; if that be your pleasure (saith Mountgomery) you shall not heareafter charge me with cowardise, under this Standard have I got honour, and under this Standard (if God so so please) I will dye.</hi> With this they wheeled about and overtooke the foot of the Irish, being loden with armes, and wearied with fight, with their launces they strooke them to the ground, they gave the on-set a fresh upon the horsemen which were about 200. and had
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:18659:156"/>
                     <hi>Connor O Laghlin</hi> to their leader, who retreated in battaile array, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to answer the fight. Sir <hi>Amoricus</hi> in that skirmish was twice vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horsed, and by his men lift up againe, afterwards in a filthy foord he was unhorsed againe, and his horse slaine under him: whereupon some of his troope lighted, stood very stoutly by him, tooke wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons out of the dead mens hands that lay along the way, &amp; kept the Foord from horse and man, untill Sir <hi>Iohn de Courcy</hi> came to the res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue, at which time many of the Irish were slaine, and the rest fled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: thus in the end God gave the victory unto the English men, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the losse of many a brave man, and especially <hi>Lyonell Saint Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> nephew to <hi>Amoricus,</hi> whose death was greatly lamented. When they had buried their dead, and gathered their armes, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Dune.</p>
                  <p>The Midsummer following, <hi>Courcy</hi> fought the second battaile nigh the walles of Dune (saith <hi>Stanihurst</hi>) and overthrew fifteene thousand men in Vlster. And saith the booke of <hi>Houth,</hi> after that field, Vlster men had small stomacke to give any onset upon the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish men: yet I finde the field to have beene bloudy of both sides, and that Sir <hi>Amoricus</hi> was sore wounded, laid under a hedge, eating hony suckles for his reliefe, where he left much bloud, and was carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away betweene foure men; his wounds were so many, and so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, that no Physitian or Surgeon could promise life the space of nine dayes, yet in the end, recovered. Next unto him was his sonne Sir <hi>Nicholas Saint Laurence,</hi> a most valiant Knight so sore wounded in nine severall places, that he was once left for dead, but at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, to the great comfort of his friends.</p>
                  <p>The third battaile that Sir <hi>Iohn de Courcy</hi> fought, was in Ferng, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst eleaven thousand Irish men: the occasion was thus, <hi>Courcy</hi> had builded many Castles throughout Vlster, and especially in Fern, where <hi>Mac Mahon</hi> dwelled; this <hi>Mac Mahon</hi> with solemne protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions vowed to become a true and faithfull subiect, gave <hi>Courcy</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gifts, and made him his Goship, which is a league of amitie high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly esteemed in Ireland. Whereupon <hi>Courcy</hi> gave him two Castles with their demeanes to hold of him. Within one moneth after, this <hi>Mac Mahon</hi> returning to his vomit, brake downe the Castles, and made them even with the ground. Sir <hi>Iohn de Courcy</hi> sent unto him to know the cause that moved him to fall to this villanie: his answer was, that he promised not to hold stones of him, but the land, and that it was contrary to his nature, to couch himselfe within cold stones, the woods being so nigh, where he might better warme him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, with other slender and scornefull answers. <hi>Courcy</hi> to be reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of him, saw no better course then to prey his country, mustred his men, entred the land, and swept all the cattell before him. The prey was so great, that it could not be driven, unlesse it were devided into three parts, and to that end, this company in like sort was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:18659:156"/>
betweene the foremost of the voward, and the last of the rereward, there was three miles distance; the paces were narrow, the way miry and boggy, with thicke bushes on either side, the Irish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as I said before) eleven thousand in number, stood upon all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, had their espials upon them, divided themselves likewise, and stept in betweene every of the English companies, and upon a sudden, made such a cry, and gave such a shout, that the woods rang thereof, and the Cowes ranne like divels upon the drivers, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw horse and man, so that there were more slaine and trode under foot in the mire and dirt, of the English men, by the Cowes, then by the sword of the rebels. Vpon this cry, all the Cowes were lost, and the men fell to blowes, where the Irish being acquainted with every blinde way, made better shift then the English. <hi>Courcy</hi> and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Amoricus,</hi> with such as were alive, hastened out of the woods, and came to a Plaine, where they viewed each other some quarter of a mile distant. Sir <hi>Amoric</hi> turned backe, and cast up his eyes, and saw Sir <hi>Roger Poer</hi> that had married his Neece, about a sevenight before, pulled and halled by the Irish, and carried away prisoner; follow me, saith he unto his company, I will rescue him, or I will dye on the place; he suddenly comming upon their heeles, set upon them, and carried away Sir <hi>Roger Poer</hi>; with that, the Irish gave such a shout, that all the rest of their company that were dispersed and scattered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the bushes, gathered themselves together to that place, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the cry, and stept betweene Sir <hi>Amoric</hi> and Sir <hi>Iohn Courcy,</hi> so that with great perill of their lives, and losse of many men, they came together to that place; when they met, they bewailed their losses, and being environed with bogges and marishes, they forsook their horses, and fell to kill them, and shifted for themselves; the Irish most eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pursued them, and at length, one <hi>William Lawyard</hi> overtooke <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> hee with his company turned their faces, fought a cruell fight, wherein (saith mine Author) there were slaine of the Irish men, sixe score. After this skirmish, followed <hi>Arte boy,</hi> with three hundred, and set upon <hi>Courcy,</hi> who slue of the Irish, nine score: last of all, <hi>Mac Mohon,</hi> the ground of all this mischiefe, came blowing, and set upon <hi>Courcy,</hi> with whom the base sonne of Sir <hi>Amoricus</hi> encountred, slue him, and fourescore of his men, and drove the rest to flye, the day being thus spent, the night made an end of that battaile: as the night fell, Sir <hi>Iohn de Courcy</hi> by good hap, lighted upon an old Fort of his owne, moted or trenched about, where there was a good watch kept, he being glad of them, and they of him, camped there with his forces that night, and the enemy within halfe a mile of them, as it appeared by the great fires they made after their travaile. Sir <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moric Saint Laurance</hi> after a short nap or slumber, tooke a few with him, went to espie the enemies campe, and made a speedie returne, he pressed upon his brother <hi>Courcy</hi> and the campe, to wake them, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:18659:157"/>
delivered unto them these speeches: <hi>I have scouted abroad, and spared you in your heavie sleepe, I viewed the enemies campe, whom I take to be</hi> 5000. <hi>strong, and that by the scope of their cabbins; wee are but</hi> 500. <hi>fighting men, all wearied with sore fight, long travaile, and somewhat discouraged with hard fortune, not fit to make any great enterprize, or to performe any worthy exploit; nay a worse matter, there are among us such as have deadly wounds, but the dead sleep suppresseth their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and further, our men watch without sufficient release, and the enemy hath his fill every way; our case is desperate, if the enemy set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us to morrow, we are not able to withstand him, wee shall be slaine every mothers sonne; wherefore I thinke best that we now set upon them that are now feasting and sleeping, voyd of all feare of us, whom in their opinion, they hold for men quite overthrowne, and never able to make a head againe, and that we leave some of our sicke men here to ward, and take some of the fresh men with us.</hi> When hee had ended his speech, there was silence for a certaine space, wherein one looked upon the other. Then Sir <hi>Iohn Courcy</hi> spake, I looked all this while for some of these young gallants, and your fellow souldiers to deliver their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; but one thing further, Sir <hi>Amoric,</hi> where are their horses be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed? he answereth, your white horse, and my blacke gelding, I have cunningly conveyed away, and the rest I can point you to with my finger. Then saith Sir <hi>Iohn Courcy,</hi> this is mine advice: Let two men ride these two horses, and gather their horses together, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly in each side drive them upon the enemy, all wee in armes will come after, and suddrnly give the shout upon them in their slee pes, and serve them with their horses, as they served us with our kine: Every man liked well of this course, and when they came to the place, they had the killing of them at their owne desire. There the English came, victualled, apparrelled, armed, and horsed themselves, never better in their lives. Of 5000. Irish, there escaped not above 200. which ranne so fast, (saith my Author) that a horse could not hold them. Of the English, the day before, 400. men were missing, but in that mornings worke, onely two. Lastly, Sir <hi>Iohn Courcy,</hi> with some hearts ease, returned to his old Fort, where hee had camped that night, rested there a while, and sent to Dublin and elsewhere a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his friends, for supplies of men and other necessarie provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. There are some out of the schoole of envy, with grace, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace <hi>Courcy,</hi> (whom I have in part touched before) that report the story otherwise, which deliver not wherein he was to be honoured, but wherein he was foyled, <hi>fortuna de la guerra,</hi> that hee was driven with eleven persons in armes, to travaile a foot some 30. miles, for the space of two dayes, the enemy still pursuing, (the which they lay not downe) all fasting without any reliefe, untill hee came to an old Castle of his owne, which savoureth not altogether of truth, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards with the history.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:18659:157"/>The fourth battaile that Sir <hi>Iohn Courcy</hi> fought was in Vriell, for this cause: <hi>Courcy</hi> had sent certaine of his servants into England, for victuals, munition, and divers necessaries; the ship was by foule weather driven into a creick in Vriell, cald Torshead; <hi>O Hanlan</hi> with others being acquainted with all circumstances, bord the ship, put men and mariners to the sword, and make a prize and havocke of all: <hi>Courcy</hi> hearing of this, gathered his forces together; draweth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Nury to come into Vriell to be revenged of them for this injury; by the way he was given to understand, that all the Irish of those parts were in armes prepared for him in their defence, to justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their doings, and that they had camped by South of Dundalke, and by North of the river Dondoygon. <hi>Courcy</hi> having marched to a place within a mile and a halfe of the Irish campe, made a stand, cald his brother <hi>Amoric,</hi> Sir <hi>Roger Poer,</hi> with others, and consulted what course was best to be held. Sir <hi>Roger Poer</hi> being full of courage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins: I thinke best to hold still with us the favour of Fortune; they are many, we are but few, the longer we behold them, the worse wee shall like them; the souldiers would be set a worke, and the more we linger, the more doubts and buzzes will enter his braine; for often wee see, that the sight maketh, and the sight mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</p>
                  <p>Next, Sir <hi>Amoric</hi> delivereth his opinion: we came not hither to make hasty worke, but advisedly to performe service; true it is, as you have delivered, they are manie we are but few in comparison of their number; afore we give battaile, there are 3. things (as I take it) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to be considered, the cause wherefore we fight, the number of both sides, that they be somewhat equally matched, and the place where both joyne battaile together. I would not have any of my speeches drawn to discourage or dismay any valia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t mind. To the first, our parentage is knowne, we are no base people, our valour is tryed, our enemy hath the proofe thereof; we come not to steale, but to be revenged of the theeves that murthered our men, &amp; robbed us of our necessary provision. Secondly, where we find our company small, and our side weake, and the ground not fitting us for any advantage, where force cannot further, let policie take place; my advice is that a begger or a Frier shall goe from us to the Irish campe, and informe them, that Sir <hi>Hugh Delacy</hi> came yesternight with a great force, to Drogheda, and that he saw two miles off a great army of horse and foot, somewhat westerly of him, which he supposeth to bee the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Army, that marched all night from Tradaf towards Dundalke; in the meane while, my sonne <hi>Nico:</hi> with twenty choice horsemen, together with our lackies and horseboies, for the greater shew upon our hackneis and garrans, shall wheele Westwards on the right hand, that it may concurre with the Fryers tale, and give us a signe what we shall doe, and we will march after to see the event; when the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:18659:158"/>
hath discried us, we shall perceive by his stirring what he meanes to doe; if they turne face to us and offer fight, our foot shall recouer Dondalke afore theirs, and with our horses wee will so handle the matter, that we shall sustaine no great losse: if they fly and take the river, the sea comes in, we shall overtake them afore halfe passe over. All were well pleased with his device, and followed the direction. <hi>Nico. Saint Laurence</hi> with his company, wheeles before, Sir <hi>Iohn de Courcy</hi> a loofe followeth after, Sir <hi>Roger Poer</hi> takes the rereward; the enemy having discried them takes the river: Sir <hi>Nico.</hi> gave the signe, whereupon the English Army give a great shout and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their heeles; the Irish breake their araie, they tumble one upon another in the water: the cariage drowns some, the sea and the swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the tyde take others away; such as would not venter the water, were slaine by the English; <hi>Othanlan</hi> and his company that had passed the water, seeing the slaughter of his men, could not come to the rescues, by reason of the salt water: the Englishmen having quitted that place, were directed by the Fryer to a foord on the left hand, where they passed over, and pursued the rest: The Horsemen overtooke the Foot of the Irish, and skirmished with them, untill Sir <hi>Iohn de Courcy</hi> came by that time; the sea likewise had stopped the Irish from flying, at a great water, a mile from the Lurgan on the Southside of Dundalk. The Irish seeing themselves in this strait, turne their faces, choose rather to dye with the sword like men, then to be drowned in the seas like beasts. There were in that place, some 6000. Irish, and about 1000. English, there was no advantage of ground, it booted not to fly on any side; the coward must in that case try himselfe a man, the fight was sore, no mercy but dead blowes: The foot of the English drew backe, Sir <hi>Iohn de Courcy</hi> their leader, was left in the midst of his enemies with a twohanded sword, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing and lashing on both sides, like a Lion among sheepe (saith my Author) <hi>Nicolas</hi> posteth to his father <hi>Amoric,</hi> that was in chase of ths scattred horsemen of the Irish, and cried, alas father, mine uncle Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> is left alone in the midst of his enemies, and the foot have forsaken him; with that Sir <hi>Amoric</hi> lighted, killed his horse and said, here my sonne take charge of these horsemen, and I will lead on the foot company, to the rescue of my brother <hi>Courcy</hi>; come on fellow souldiers saith he, let us live and dye together: He gave the on-set upon the foot of the Irish, rescued Sir <hi>Iohn Courcy</hi> that was sore wounded, and with cruell fight in manner out of breath; with the sight of him, the souldiers take hart and drive the Irish to retreit; the slaughter on both sides was great, few of the Irish and fewer of the English were left alive: The Irish got them to the Fewes, and the English to Dundalke; but who got the best there is no boast made.</p>
                  <p>Not long after, <hi>Sir Iohn de Courcy</hi> went into England, where the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:18659:158"/>
King in regard of his good service, made him Lord of Conoght and Earle of Vlster; upon his returne (saith <hi>Stanihurst</hi>) which was in the Canicular daies, he fought at the Bridge of Ivora a cruell battaile, and prostrated his enemies, with great honour; and for that I find litle written thereof, I thought good thus lightly to passe it over, as others before me have done: After this he builded many Castles in Vlster, made bridges, mended high wayes, repaired Churches, and governed the Country in great peace, untill the dayes of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> where I shall have further cause to discourse of him.</p>
                  <p>Amids these tumults in the North, <hi>Miles Cogan</hi> bestirred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, in the West; he passed the Shannon into Conoght with 540. men, where (saith mine Author) never Englishman entred before, whereupon the Conoght men, drove before them, all their cattle into the fastnesses, carried with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as much as they could, fired the rest, with their Townes, Villages, Houses and Cottages. <hi>Milo</hi> marched as far as Tuam, where he rested 8. dayes, and finding man and beast fled, and the Country barren of victualls, he returned towards the Shan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and by the way met with <hi>Roderic</hi> the Monarch, which lay in ambush with three Companies waiting his comming: At their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, they skirmished a long while, and fought a cruell fight, where the enemy lost many, and <hi>Milo</hi> but three men, then hee passed the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and came safely to Dublin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno William Fitz Adelme,</hi> the Kings Lievtenant is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into England: Hee was a man that did no honour to the King, neither good to the Country, whom every good man in his life time detested, and all Irish Chronicles after his death have defamed. In his roome the King appointed <hi>Hugh Delacy</hi> Deputy of Ireland, and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Commission with him <hi>Robert Poer</hi> Seneschal of Wexford and Waterford.</p>
                  <p>Not long after, the King sent into Ireland <hi>Miles Cogan</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Fitz Stephens</hi> with others, and gave them (in regard of their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) all South <hi>Mounster,</hi> to with the Kingdome of Corke in Fee for ever, to be equally divided betweene them, except the City of Corke, and one Cantred thereunto adjoyning; also he gave unto <hi>Philippe de Bruse</hi> all North <hi>Mounster,</hi> to wit the Kingdome of Lymerick. After they had pacified <hi>Dermot Mac Carty,</hi> Prince of Desmond, quieted the Country, and divided their territories, they conducted <hi>Philippe de Bruse</hi> to Lymerick to take possession of the Kings graunt given him in those parts.</p>
                  <p>As they came to the walles of Lymerick, the Citizens of spight in sight of them all, to the end that no Englishman should roost there, set the Town on fire. <hi>Philippe de Bruse</hi> was therewithal discouraged, and his Company, in so much that when <hi>Robert Fitz Stephens</hi> and <hi>Miles Cogan,</hi> offred to adventure their lives in the recovery of the Kingdome of Lymerik, with all their aide and assistance; he refused
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:18659:159"/>
it, and returned with them to Corke, esteeming it farre better to lose Lymric, and with safetie to dwell among his lovers and friends, then to lose life and kingdome by dwelling among such Iewes, as will fire their owne houses, and cut all English throats.</p>
                  <p>In a while after, <hi>Miles Cogan,</hi> and <hi>Raffe</hi> the sonne of <hi>Robert Fitz Stephens,</hi> who had lately married <hi>Miles</hi> daughter, went towards Lis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more to parlee with Waterford men, and determined that night to lodge with one <hi>Mac Tyrid,</hi> who had solemnly invited them. As they waited in the field, expecting the comming of the Waterfordians, this <hi>Mac Tyrid</hi> unawares stealing upon them, most traiterously slue them, and five of their company, whereupon the whole country was in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roare, insomuch that <hi>Dermot Mac Carty,</hi> and all the Irish in those parts, together with <hi>Mac Tyrid,</hi> that most perfidious traitor, were in armes, determining thenceforth to be no longer the Kings loyall subjects; when they had gathered their forces together, they laid siege to Corke, meaning to cut off <hi>Robert Fitz Stephens,</hi> and all the English men there. <hi>Robert Fitz Stephens</hi> being distressed in Corke, fearing the open enemy without, and mistrusting the secret enemy within, sent post to Wexford, to his nephew <hi>Reimond le Grosse,</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to come to his aide. <hi>Reimund</hi> forthwith, with twenty knights, and one hundred foot and bowmen, entred the Lee, landed at Corke, encountred with the enemies, killed some, drove other to flye, and compelled the rest to submit themselves, and sue for peace.</p>
                  <p>When the King understood of this, he sent <hi>Richard Cogan,</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto <hi>Miles,</hi> to supply his brothers roome in the kingdome of Corke, a man no way inferiour to his brother for valour and martiall prowesse; in his companie came <hi>Philip Barry,</hi> and <hi>Girald Barry</hi> his brother, (otherwise called <hi>Silvester Giraldus Cambrensis,</hi> the famous learned man) nephewes of <hi>Robert Fitz Stephens,</hi> with a jolly troupe of horse and foot, chosen and picked men. <hi>Robert Fitz Stephens,</hi> and <hi>Richard Cogan</hi> enjoyed this kingdome of Corke peaceably for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine yeeres, and in processe of time, for want of heires male of them, it came to two daughters, the one of them was married to <hi>Robert de Carew,</hi> the other to <hi>Patricke de Courcy,</hi> and they in right of their wives, enjoyed the same during their lives, and after them, their heires, untill such time as by a division growne (as I take it in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land) betweene the two houses of Yorke and Lancaster, the Irish men expelled them, and recovered the country unto themselues. <hi>Anno</hi> 1178. <hi>The Monasterie, Beatae Mariae Roseae vallis,</hi> called <hi>Rosgl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I may not forget <hi>Harvey de monte Marisco,</hi> (of whom often mention is made before) who after many spitefull parts, treacheries and false accusations ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by him unto the King against most noble servitors, became a Monke: the man was sore troubled in conscience, and in his course he made the common saying true (<hi>desperatio facit Monachum.</hi>) Hee

                  <p>The same yeere (saith <hi>Holinshed</hi>) there came from Pope <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> 3. into England, two Cardinals, <hi>Alberto desuma,</hi> and <hi>Petro de sancta Agatha,</hi> whose commission was to summon the Bishops of England, Ireland, Scotland, with the Isles, and Normandie, to the generall Councell of Lateran in Rome: after they had obtained li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to passe through his dominions, the King swore them upon the holy Evangelist, that in their Legateship they should not attempt any thing that might be hurtfull to the King or his dominions, and that upon their returne, they should visite him homewards: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon out of Ireland there went thither, <hi>Laurence,</hi> Archbishop of Dublin, and <hi>Catholicus,</hi> Archbishop of Tuam, with some other five or sixe Irish Bishops, whom the King likewise swore, that they should not procure any damage to his Realmes and dominions.</p>
                  <p>The Realme of Ireland at this time was singular well governed by <hi>Hugh de Lacy,</hi> a good man, and a wise Magistrate, who for the good of the land and the people, established many good orders: he made Bridges, and builded Townes, Castles, and Forts, throughout Lein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, as Sir <hi>Iohn de Courcy</hi> did in Vlster in his time; the Priest kept his Church, the Souldier his Garrison, and the Plow-man followed his Plough, yet cankred envy quieted not her selfe, practised mischiefe against him, so that he was charged before the King, to attempt the Crowne of Ireland, and make himselfe absolute Lord of the land, and that he had married the King of Connaghts daughter, (saith <hi>Holin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed</hi>) contrary to the Kings pleasure. The King immediately (as Princes are jealous of great men) called him into England, appointed governours, <hi>Iohn Constable,</hi> and <hi>Richard Peche.</hi> This <hi>Lacy</hi> behaved himselfe so discreetly and dutifully in England, that he cleered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of all suspition, that the King was resolved of his truth and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and sent him backe againe into Ireland, with further credit then formerly he had done, and that within three moneths, and gave him the absolute command and Lievetenantship of the land, and joyned as assistant unto him, <hi>Robert Salisbury,</hi> calling home the former go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours.</p>
                  <p>It was not long, but he was upon malitious occasion, the second time sent for into England, and one <hi>Philip</hi> of Worcester, (<hi>Cambren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi> is mine Author) a valiant souldier, a bountifull and a liberall man, with a most brave troupe of horse and foot, arrived in Ireland, with command to send over <hi>Hugh de Lacy,</hi> and he to remaine there as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the land, until <hi>Iohn</hi> his sonne came over. <hi>Stanihurst</hi> is of opinion, that he went over into England, and cleering himselfe, spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:18659:160"/>
returned againe, which cannot well stand with the course of the history; for when <hi>Philip</hi> of Worcester tooke upon him the governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Lacy</hi> hastened the building and finishing of the Castle of Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wath (whereof my penne immediately shall make report) and there ended his dayes. And now to <hi>Philip</hi> of Worcester, and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion <hi>Hugh Tirell, Cambrensis,</hi> and <hi>Stanihurst</hi> especially, write most bitter of them: of <hi>Philip,</hi> how that first of all he resumed and seized unto the Kings use, the lands of <hi>Ocathesie,</hi> and divers other parcels which <hi>Hugh de Lacy</hi> had sold away, and these he appointed to serve for the Kings provision, and the Governours diet. And after the winter was past, he assembled and mustred his men and companie, and began to travaile from place to place. In March about the middle of Lent, he came to Armagh, where he extorted, and perforce exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the Clergie there, a great masse of money and treasure, and from thence he went to Dune, and from Dune to Dublin, laden with gold, silver, money, and monies worth, the which he extorted in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very place where he came, and other good did he none. <hi>Hugh Tirell</hi> his fellow scraper, tooke from the poore Priests at Armagh, a great brasse panne or brewing fornace, which served the whole house: see the iust iudgment of God, (the which then was so constraced, as <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brensis</hi> hath delivered in his Vaticinall history, and likewise in his to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagraphie) <hi>Philip</hi> at the townes end of Armagh, was taken with a sudden pang, and the same so vehement, that it was supposed hee should never have recovered it. When he came to himselfe, a poore man standing by said, <hi>Let him alone, he must have breath till he come to the divell, and then the divell will have him, and all that he extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from us. Hugh Tirell</hi> that carried the panne as farre as Dune, and the Priests curse withall, in night time had his lodging set on fire, where house, and houshold-stuffe, and all that he had there, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed to ashes, together with the horses that drew the same (and so no thankes to him) he left it behinde him for lacke of carriage. The Castles which <hi>Lacie</hi> builded for the good of the Land, were these. First, Laghlen, of old called the Blacke Castle, upon the Barrow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Ossory and Idrone, of which Castle by <hi>Henry</hi> 2. command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>Robert Poer</hi> had the charge, untill in cowardize sort he gave o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the same, and forsooke it; whereupon <hi>Cambrensis</hi> then living, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this invective: O what worthy Champions and fit men for martiall feates, were this <hi>Poer</hi> and <hi>Fitz Adelme,</hi> to inhabit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand such a nation as is destitute of noble and valiant mindes? but a man may espie the variable sleight of fortune, disposed to smile at foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, how from the base dunghill, hee advanceth to high dignities: for why? they two had more pleasure in chambering, wantonnesse, playing with young girles, and on the Harpe, then in bearing of shield, or wearing of Armour: but in sooth it is to bee admired, that so Noble a Prince as <hi>Henry</hi> 2. is, would send such cowards to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:18659:160"/>
or to direct in place of service. But to the history. This blacke Castle now called New Leighlin, for difference of Old Leighlin, which is the Bishops seate, standeth in the Barony of Ydrone, which was the antient inheritance of the <hi>Carews</hi>: who being Barons of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rew in Wales, so farre as I can learne, one of them married the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and heire of the Barron of Ydrone, and so the <hi>Carewes</hi> became, and were for the terme of many yeeres, Barons of Ydrone, untill the troublesome time of <hi>Richard</hi> 2. when the <hi>Carewes</hi> with all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish of Ireland, in manner were driven to forsake the land.<note place="margin">Castles buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Sir <hi>H de Lacy.</hi>

In <hi>Meth,</hi> he buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Clanarec, Dunach killar, <hi>alias</hi> Killairie, the Castle of <hi>Adam de Ieypon, alias sureport,</hi> and <hi>Gilbert de Nugents</hi> of Delvyn. In Fotheret of Onolan, <hi>alias</hi> Fethred Onolan, in Latin, <hi>Rotheric,</hi> he builded a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle for <hi>Reimond,</hi> and another for <hi>Griffin</hi> his brother, the sonnes of <hi>William Fitz Girald,</hi> for <hi>Walter</hi> of Ridensford, he builded in Omor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chu, <hi>alias Moroghs</hi> country Trisseldermot, otherwise called Trisdel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermot, about five miles from Caterlogh, and likewise Kilka, in the country of Kildare. For <hi>Iohn de Hereford,</hi> he builded a Castle in Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lach, otherwise called Tulacfelmeth: for <hi>Iohn declawsa, alias Clavill,</hi> he builded a Castle upon the Barrow, not farre from Leighlin, now supposed to be Carlogh, though some attribute it to <hi>Eva,</hi> Earle <hi>Strangbow</hi> his wife; yet it is evident next after the Danes, that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish men builded all the Castles of Ireland. He builded also neere A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy, a Castle that he gave to <hi>Robert Bigaret,</hi> another not farre from thence, which he gave to <hi>Thomas Fleminge,</hi> another at the Narach on the Barrow, for <hi>Robert Fitz Richard</hi>; lastly, he builded the Castle of Derwath, where he made a tragicall end; for on a time when each man was busily occupied, some lading, some heaving, some playste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, some engraving, the Generall also himselfe digging with a Pick-axe, a desperate villaine among them, whose toole the Lord Lieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant used, espying both his hands occupied, and his body bent downewards, with an axe, cleft his head in sunder; his body the two Archbishops, <hi>Iohn</hi> of Dublin, and <hi>Mathew</hi> of Cashill, buried in the Monasterie of the Bectie, that is, <hi>in Monasterio Beatitudinis,</hi> and his head in Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> Abbey at Dublin, whose death (I read in <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linshed</hi>) the King was not sorry of, for he was alwayes jealous of his greatnesse.</p>
                  <p>Vpon the death of <hi>Lacy,</hi> Sir <hi>Roger le Poer</hi> a most worthy Knight, who served valiantly in Vlster, in company with Sir <hi>Iohn de Courcy,</hi> being made Governour of the country about Leighlen in Ossorie, was

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1180. The Monastery <hi>De Choro Benedicti,</hi> and of <hi>Ieripont</hi> was founded. The same yeere dyed <hi>Laurence</hi> Archbishop of Dublin (whose life foraine Writers, as <hi>Surius, Baronius, Molanus,</hi> and <hi>Lep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelo</hi> with others have written) his father hight <hi>Maurice,</hi> his mother <hi>Iniabre Principis filia,</hi> a great Commander in Leinster; the Marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rologe of <hi>Sarum</hi> saith he was bastard: This <hi>Maurice</hi> being at conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall warres with <hi>Dermot Mac Morogh</hi> King of Leinster, upon a league of amity concluded betweene them, delivered unto him for pledge his youngest sonne <hi>Laurence; Dermot</hi> sent him to a desert solitary place and barren soile to be kept, where he was like to perish with famine: <hi>Maurice</hi> hearing thereof, tooke 12. of <hi>Dermots</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall followers, clapt them in prison, and sent <hi>Dermot</hi> word, that hee would cut off their heads, unlesse he would release and send him his sonne out of that slavish and miserable servitude: <hi>Dermot</hi> released the youth, and delivered him not to his father, but to the Bishop of Glandelogh, and the Bishop charged his Chaplen with his bringing up; the Chaplen trained him up so vertuously, that in a short time after he was made Abbot of Glandelogh, &amp; shortly after that againe, upon the death of <hi>Gregory</hi> Archbishop of Dublin, he was chosen to suceed him. So holy a man was he, as some of mine Authors doe write, that he caused one of his men to whippe him twice a day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like he had deserved it in his youth. His Legend reporteth that in time of famine and scarcity in Ireland, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He came to the King at Canterbury, where the Monkes recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him with solemne Procession, and hee gave himselfe one whole night to prayers before Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> his shrine, for good successe in his affaires with the King: A foole espied him in his Pontificall weed, wholly devoted to Saint <hi>Thomas Becket</hi>: And said, <hi>I can doe no better deed then to make him equall with Saint Thomas</hi>; with that tooke a club, ranne through the throng, and gave him such ablow upon the pat, that the blood ran downe his eares; the man was so sore wounded, that it was thought hee would streighway yeeld up the Ghost; the cry was up, the foole runne away, the Bishop taking breath called for water, and in a short time after was healed: his sute

unto the King was, (as foraigne Writers deliver) for <hi>Deronog</hi> King of Ireland; but saith <hi>Holinshed,</hi> which is likeliest to bee true, it was in the behalf of <hi>Roderic</hi> King of Conoght, which had often promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed true subjection and fidelity unto the King, but never performed; he had brought with him <hi>Roderic</hi> his sonne as a pledge for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of convenants, formerly passed betweene them; as the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of tribute and such like; but the King neither liked the one or the other, but charged the Archbishop not to depart without his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.</p>
                  <p>The King shortly after tooke shipping at Sandwich and sailed into Normandy. The Archbishop followed him, and there dyed of an Ague; whereupon (as <hi>Holinshed</hi> writeth) the King sent <hi>Ieffray De Haile,</hi> one of his Chaplens and a Chaplen also of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Popes Legat into Ireland, to seize the Archbi. see into his hands, and further it is alleaged, that being the Popes Legate of Ireland; he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred incontinency so much, that for augmentation of penance, hee would absolve no dissolute Priest, but sent them to Rome for absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and proved in regard of former favours, there, <hi>Amicus Curiae,</hi> so that he sent thither out of Ireland at one time, 140.

In <hi>Anno</hi> 1185. he dubbed his sonne <hi>Iohn,</hi> Knight, and set him in a readinesse for Ireland, sending the new Bishop <hi>Iohn</hi> of Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, as his precurser thither for all things necessarie. Item the same yeere he obtained of Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> 3. a licence to crowne which hee would of his sonnes, King of Ireland, and for reformation thereof, sent him a crowne of Peacocks tayles, I would say feathers, after a
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:18659:163"/>
feat manner woven in with gold; lastly, how that <hi>Vrban</hi> 3. sent two Legates, <hi>Octavianus,</hi> a subdeacon Cardinall, and <hi>Hugh de Novant</hi> from the Court of Rome, to crowne <hi>Iohn,</hi> King of Ireland, but <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> 2. delayed it so, that it was not effected; hereof (as I suppose) it ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that oftentimes we finde him called King <hi>Iohn</hi> afore he was crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: but to the Irish history. At the first landing and entring of the Kings sonne at Waterford, a great many of the chiefest commanders in those parts, who since their first submission unto King <hi>Henry,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued faithfull and true, being advertised of this his arrivall, came and resorted unto him in peaceable manner after their best manner, to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute him and congragulate his comming, one made curtesie, another kneeled, some tooke him by the hand, other some offer to kisse him. The new gallants and Normans, such as had not beene before ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the country, neither the homelinesse of the people, set them at nought, laughed at their Mantles and Troosses, derided their glibbes and long beards, one takes a sticke, and pats the Irish man on the pate, another halls the mantle, and pricks him behinde with a pinne, some have their glibbes and long beards pulled, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, have flappes on the lippes, thumpes in their neckes, and the doores clapt on their heeles, with diuers other abuses, and undiscreet entertainement. These men (not without cause) being mightily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased, shifted themselves out of the towne, and in all haste got them home. And from thence (saith <hi>Cambrensis</hi>) with their wives, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and houshold, departed, and went some to the Prince of Lyme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric, some to the Prince of Corke, some to <hi>Roderic,</hi> Prince of Connaght, and so some to one Lord, and some to another; and to these they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared orderly, how they had beene at Waterford, and what they had seene there, and how they were evill intreated, and that a yong man was come thither, guarded with beardlesse boyes, and guided by the councels of young men, in whom there was no stay, no sobriety, no stedfastnesse, no assurednesse, whereby they and their country might be secured of any safety.</p>
                  <p>These Princes, and namely they three of Connaght, Corke, and Lymeric, who were the chiefest, and who were then preparing themselves in a readinesse to have come and salute the Kings Sonne, and to have yeelded unto him their dutifull obeysance, as faithfull subiects; when they had heard these newes, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan forthwith to bethinke themselves, that of such evill beginning, a worse ending would ensue: wherefore with one consent, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to stand and ioyne together against the English nation, and to their uttermost power, to adventure their lives, and to stand to the defence of their country and liberties, and for the performance thereof, they enter into a new league among themselves, and swore each to other, and by that meanes, enemies before, are now become friends, and reconciled, as of old, <hi>Ephraim</hi> against <hi>Manasses,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasses</hi>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:18659:163"/>
against <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and both against the Tribe of <hi>Iuda. Herod</hi> against <hi>Pilate,</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> against <hi>Herod,</hi> both become friends to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie Christ. To be short, there followed a generall revolt and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion over all Ireland. <hi>Cambrensis</hi> alledgeth a second cause of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt. How that when <hi>Robert Fitz Setphens</hi> first entred the land, there were certaine Irish men which tooke part with him, served faithfully, and were as reason required, rewarded for their service, and had for recompence, certaine lands given them, which they quietly held, and peaceably enioyed, untill the comming of the Kings sonne, then new commers wanting both living and governement, had it given them to furnish them in their foolish prodigalitie, so that these Irish men flying unto the enemies, became not onely enemies, but were espials upon the English, and conductors of the enemy against them. A third reason of ill successe, <hi>Cambrensis</hi> urgeth against England; first, how that the Britaines or Cambrians (so he termeth them) entring this land, and breaking the ice to the conquest of Ireland, were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by <hi>William Fitz Adelme,</hi> and others, envied, and every way maligned: secondly, how that the English commanding the land, were by the English disgraced, and one often times articling, accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and disgracing one another: thirdly, how that the Normans comming in place, overthrew all, for the King being borne beyond the seas, affected them most, they were of his Councell at home in time of peace, and made Commanders abroad in time of warres; these comming with the Kings sonne into Ireland, were fine in their apparrell, delicate mouthed, feeding upon dainties, they could not disgest their meat without Spice and Wine at every meale; they could not endure the service in the Marches and borders, they would not remaine in remote places, they brooked not the Forts, Holds, and Garrison places; but liberty they liked of, so it were in a walled town; a warme chamber, a Ladies lappe, a soft bed, a furre gowne, and their Lords sides to guard and attend, pleased them well; they would talke and bragge of service, sweare and stare at home, stand upon the pantofles of their reputation, disdaine others, and especially the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, and durst not shew their faces in the field. These were they that gave themselves to command the Irish, that would not be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by them, they polled, pilled, extorted, and what not.</p>
                  <p>In the space of eight moneths that Earle <hi>Iohn</hi> staied in Ireland, I finde that he built three Castles, Tibrach, Lismoore, and Archfinan, <hi>alias</hi> Ardsivin: at Ardsivin upon Midsummer day, (so <hi>Cambrensis</hi> reporteth) the Prince of Lymeric bent and animated to rebellion, slue foure Knights, and the greater part of the Garrison there: shortly after, the same rebels of Lymric, by a slight, drew out the Garrison to seize upon a prey, and lying in ambush, killed many of them, but these revolters escaped not scotfree in all the parts of the land: for at this time when the Irish men of Kennally with great forces had
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:18659:164"/>
entred Meth, killing, burning, spoiling, and preying the Country. <hi>William le Petit,</hi> Governour or Iusticer (saith <hi>Cambrensis</hi>) drew a head against them, rescued the prey, put them to flight, made a great slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of them, and sent a hundred heads of the principall of them to Dublin.</p>
                  <p>The Kings sonne hearing of these troubles, hastned away unto England, left the land tumultuous, troublesome &amp; al upon an uprore; committed the charge thereof (saith <hi>Stanihurst) Bruseo, Courceo, Giraldidis, &amp;c. in primis Hugonis Lacaei virtuti,</hi> where in truth I find no such matter, for <hi>Cambrensis</hi> (whom herein I must relie unto) being then in Ireland with the Kings son, reporteth how that <hi>Henry</hi> the second, hearing of the course which these greene heads held in Ireland; thought good to call them all unto England, and send thither no more such young commanders, and by the advice of his Councell committed the charge and absolute command thereof, unto Sir <hi>Iohn de Courcy,</hi> whom hee appointed Lord Lievtenant of Ireland (the Booke of <hi>Houth</hi> also testifieth the same.) Earle <hi>Iohn</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly gathered forces, travailed over the whole land, pacified for the time <hi>Corke, Tumound and Conoght,</hi> From the death of <hi>Hugh Delacy,</hi> who was slaine, <hi>Anno</hi> 1186. unto the time <hi>Hugh Delacy</hi> the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger came to be Lord Iustice, of whom hereafter more at large. Here gentle Reader, <hi>Cambrensis</hi> leaveth us, who most faithfully continued the affaires of Ireland, some 30. yeeres and odde: he was by father a <hi>Barry,</hi> by mother a <hi>Gerraldin,</hi> nephew to <hi>Morice Fitz Gerald</hi> and <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Fitz Stephens,</hi> that first entred to the Conquest of Ireland; hee was borne in Pembrok-shire, and was Archdecon of Saint <hi>Davids</hi> and <hi>Brechnoc,</hi> and diversly imployed by <hi>Henry</hi> the second, in whose time, among others, the first Conquerors &amp; his kindred; he came into Ireland againe, and became Tutor unto <hi>Iohn</hi> the Kings sonne, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him into Ireland; he wrote many learned workes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other, the Conquest of Ireland, the Topography of Ireland, and <hi>Mirabilia Hiberniae.</hi> Whereof hee dedicated one unto <hi>Richard</hi> Earle <hi>Strangbow,</hi> and another unto <hi>Henry</hi> the second; he was elected Archbishop of Saint <hi>Davids,</hi> but at Rome he was out-bid, by him that had more money, and missed the Cushin; hee departed this life, when hee was about foure score yeeres old, and resteth at Saint <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids.</hi> Yet one thing further of him which he reporteth of himselfe, how that he at the time of his being in Ireland, had Conference with <hi>Mathew Archbishop of Cashill,</hi> and he saying among other things: You have many <hi>Saints in Ireland,</hi> but I doe not find any martyr a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monst you: the Bishop taking it in ill part, as spoken in derision of the Nation, answered with great anger, Sir, it is so that our people is rude, savage and barbarous, yet there is none so brutish and blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as to lay violent hands upon a Priest; now it fals out that wee are to be governed by such a Nation as is not guiltlesse of Prelats

deaths, and it is like, (if it stands with Gods pleasure) that shortly we shall make up a number of Irish martyrs this he spitefully spake, mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the death of <hi>Thomas</hi> of Canterbury.</p>
                  <p>In a while after that Sir <hi>Iohn de Courcy</hi> had brought the whole land to a good passe,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>H de Lacy.</hi> the yonger L. Iustice of lie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> and pacified the Irish tumults (this I find in the Booke of <hi>Houth</hi>) Sir <hi>Hugh Delacy</hi> the younger is sent over into Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land as Lord Iustice, to take the absolute Command of the Realme. He had no sooner landed but he sent very imperious letters unto Sir <hi>Iohn de Courcy,</hi> to discharge him, and all that were authorized by him of their places, and command, and in like sort (like the green heads spoken of a little before, which landed with Earle <hi>Iohn</hi>) they braved it out, disdained old experimented souldiers, and offered sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry disgraces unto the rest of the English; so that thereof rose much heartburning, division, quarrels and bloody brawles. The Irish seeing this sudden alteration, this division among the English, this undiscreet government, thought now to find fit opportunity publikely to rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ase themselves of that, which they had oft secretly intended; by their runnagades they summoned at a day a place, all the Chieftaines of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish birth to a parlee; where after many doubts debated, many griefes opened, they concluded with full resolution to invade all the English, and roote them wholly out of the land; and first they swoare to bee true one to another, throughout that whole rancke of rebels, as farre as life, lands, and goods would reach to effect this enterprise: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they swoare never to yeeld obedience to the English nation againe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oconor</hi> King of Conaght becomes the mouth of the Irish,<note place="margin">

Sir <hi>Iohn de Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> understanding this, and doubting what hee should finde at Sir <hi>Hugh Delacies</hi> hands, sent letters in post to his brother Sir <hi>Amorick Saint Laurence</hi> who shortly to his ayd marched towards the North, with 30. Knights and 200. foot. <hi>Oconor</hi> hearing this, lyeth in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush in most secret wise, and sendeth scouts of horse and foot before him, to apprehend and cut off all espials, which might bewray his ambush, and give intelligence to Sir <hi>Amorick</hi> to prevent the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; Sir <hi>Amorick</hi> boldly marcheth on, misdoubting nothing, for that he understandeth by his espials nothing to the contrary, till he came to the Divels mouth; where upon a sudden, beholding <hi>Oconor</hi> and his huge Army peeping out of their ambush, was amazed, made a stand, and consulting with his company, wist not what to doe; there was no flying, there was no fighting, one to a hundred was no equal match; a horseman whose name was <hi>Mountgomery,</hi> in a few words
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:18659:165"/>
said this. Let us fly and save our lives, as for the foot company wee can doe them no good by figting; by flying and saving our owne lives, we may succour their wives, children and kindred. By that time Sir <hi>Amorick</hi> his brother (leader of the foot company) came to the consultation, and said, I see by all circumstances, that you meane to flie, and you Sir <hi>Amorick</hi> my noble brother, what meane you to give eare to these cowardly horsemen, will you leave us here as sheepe in the mouths of this mercilesse people, and ravening wolfes, ready to rent us in peeces? Have you forgotten the bloody battels we followed you in? and do you not see that we have left our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, our wives, our children and dearest friends, and now stand at deaths doore, to be forsaken of you whom wee never left so disolate and distressed: if you weigh not our lamentable estate, regard your owne honour, and the house you are descended of. Will you lose in an houre, the honour you wanne in many yeeres? Call to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, most worthy Knight, how that in Vriell in manner in the like distresse; you dismounted your selfe, slew your horse, led the foot, animated the company, recovered your selfe, and ended with honour? Wee are your flesh and your blood, wee come hither to fight, to live and to dye together; I know the worst; I am resolved, if we fight we dye, if we fly we are slaine; is it not better for us to dye in fight like men, and so winne honour, then to bee slaine in flight like beasts, and gaine shame for ever? With this Sir <hi>Amorick</hi> turned him to the foot company, and hardly gathering breath with the sorrow of his heart, resolved himselfe thus: I have no power to fly and leave my frinds, my flesh and blood, in this extreme distresse. I will live with them, who for my sake came hither, if it so please God, and I will dye with them, if it bee his pleasure, that ending here wee shall meet againe bodies and soules at the last day, God and the World beare witnesse, that wee doe as Christian Knights ought to doe, I yeeld my soule into Gods hands, my body to returne whence it came, my service to my naturall Prince, my heart to my wife and brother, Sir <hi>Iohn de Courcy,</hi> my might, my force and bloody sweat to the ayd of you all that are in the field: He lighted, kneeled upon his knees, kissed the crosse of his sword, ranne his horse through, saying thou shalt never serve against mee, that so worthily hast served with mee. The like did all the rest; then looking about with a chearefull coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, as if he had not beene the man, that was formerly dismaid, charged two young Gentlemen of the company to get them to the top of an Hill, hard by adjoyning, and beholding the battell, upon their returne homwards make true report to his brother <hi>Courcy</hi> and others of that daies service. Immediatly they prepared to battaile, the enemies marvailed, seeing them approch, that they durst (being so few) abide the field; they made likewise a stand, and cast doubts, whether the Englishmen in this attempt had not some great supply;
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:18659:165"/>
rescues are maine battaile following after, they would not give the on-set, before they had certain knowledge thereof, by scoutes and espials: to be short, they joyne the battaile, where to deliver the whole in few words; Sir <hi>Amorick</hi> was slaine and all his company. It was a bloody day, when all the one side, and a 1000. of the other side, fell to ground. <hi>Oconor</hi> and his company seing the end of this field, durst never againe give battell unto the English, but sued to Sir <hi>Hugh Delacy</hi> then Lord Iustice for peace, which he obtained, vowing, as he had many a time before, faith, truth and perfect subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: This <hi>Oconor</hi> after his reconciliation made report unto Sir <hi>Hugh Delacy,</hi> of that daies work, that he thought verily, there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the like seen upon the earth; how that the Englishmen not being able to stand in fight, turned backe to backe, with sparthes and two handed swords, untill the last man was slaine. The lamentation that Sir <hi>Iohn de Courcy</hi> made, when this was bruted abroad, I will not stand to rehearse.</p>
                  <p>I am now to end with King <hi>Henry</hi> the second, a most worthy Prince, whose troubles every way troubled not him so much, as the unnaturall rebellion of his sonnes, and the Iealousie of his Queene; he raigned 34. yeeres, 9. months and two dayes: his Epitaph in <hi>Mathew Paris</hi> and in others I find thus.</p>

                  <p>This <hi>William,</hi> his surname was not <hi>Marshall,</hi> as Sir <hi>Iohn Plunket</hi> his collection hath laid downe, but <hi>Maxfield,</hi> his descent I finde thus; with <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, there came into England to his ayde, one <hi>Walter Maxfield</hi> a Norman, that was his Marshall; this <hi>Walter</hi> had issue, <hi>William, William</hi> had issue, <hi>Walter, Walter</hi> had issue, <hi>Iohn, Iohn</hi> had issue, this <hi>William Maxfield,</hi> that married <hi>Isabell,</hi> the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Strangbow,</hi> who was made Earle Marshall of England, Earle of Penbroke in Wales, and Prince of Leinster in Ireland, in the right of his wife.

                     <hi>Richard Marshall</hi> the second brother succeeded; he was Earle Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall of England, Earle of Penbroke in Wales, and Ogie in Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, and Prince of Leinster in Ireland.

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:18659:167"/>
his time. His tombe (with the tombe of eighteene Knights that came over at the Conquest, and resting in that Abbey) at the suppression of the Monasterie, was defaced, and inhabitants there turned them to their private uses; and of some they made swine-troughs, so as there remaineth no Monument in the said Abbey, save one stone, whereupon the picture of a Knight is portraied, bearing a shield a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his necke, wherein the <hi>Cantwels</hi> armes are insculped; and yet the people there call it Ryddir in Curry, that is, <hi>the Knight slaine at the Curraghe.

                  <p>After the decease of <hi>Richard Gilbert,</hi> Marshall, the third brother was Earle Marshall of England, Earle of Penbroke and Ogie, and Prince of Leinster, <hi>Anno</hi> 1239. King <hi>Henry</hi> the third held his Christmas at Winchester, where there rose a grudge betweene the King and this Earle <hi>Gilbert,</hi> by reason that this same Earle, with his servants, having tip-staves in their hands, comming to the Court, were not suffered to enter within the gates, but were kept backe by the Porters and others: of which injury when hee complained, the King made him an overthwart answer. Whereupon the Earle not well pleased therewith, estranged himselfe from the Court, and went into the North country, so that thenceforth, he and his brother <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> gave small attendance upon the King; and to end with this Earle <hi>Gilbert,</hi> it fell out on a time, in a Turnay which hee had attempted without the Citie of Hereford, contrary to the Kings pleasure, that his unruly horse cast him, so that of the hurt which he tooke with the fall, he shortly after departed this life, in the yeere 1241. and was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the new temple Church at London: hee had married the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Margaret,</hi> the sister of <hi>Alexander,</hi> King of Scots, who by her had no issue; she also dyed <hi>Anno</hi> 1245.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Walter Marshall</hi> succeeded <hi>Gilbert</hi> in all the former honours and possessions, both in England and Ireland, who because he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the turnament wherein his brother was slaine, hardly obtained of the king the same. He departed this life at Godrike Castle by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:18659:167"/>
and was buried at Tintern, <hi>Anno</hi> 1245. leaving no issue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anselme</hi> Marshall the fift sonne of <hi>William</hi> Earle Marshall suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded <hi>Walter,</hi> hee was the last of the <hi>Maxfields,</hi> and died without issue. Hee had married <hi>Mathildis</hi> or <hi>Mawd</hi> daughter of the Earle of Hereford, anc because hee had entred without doing of homage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King, his wife after his decease could have no dowry, wherof among the statutes of England I find the cause by especial words thus overruled·</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When any dyeth and his heire entreth into the Land,</hi> that his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesters held of the King, the day that he died before he hath done ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the King, and received seisin of the King, hee shall give no free hold thereby; and if hee dyed seised during that time, his wife shall not be indowed of the same land as came late in urc; by <hi>Mawd</hi> the daughter of the Earle of Hereford, wife of <hi>Anselme</hi> the Marshal. Who after the death of <hi>Walter</hi> Marshall of England his brother, tooke his seisin of the Castle and mannor of Strogill, and died in the same Castle; before hee had entred by the King, and before hee had done homage unto him, whereupon it was agreed, that his wife should not be indowed, because that her husband had not entred by the King, but rather by trusion.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Anselme</hi> died in England, and was buried at Tinterne. After the death of these five brethren; <hi>Florilegus</hi> writeth thus. All the sonnes of <hi>William</hi> the great Marshall (it is not knowne what sinne required the same) according to the Prophecy of the Countesse their mother, without issue left behind them, as shadowes departed out of this world; yet all successively became Earles, even as their mother by a Propheticall spirit foreshewed, and so the Noble sheild or buckler of the Marshalls, dreadful to so many and so great enemies of England, vanished away. <hi>Mathew Paris</hi> wrote the story at large. The aforesaid <hi>William,</hi> as Warlike and stout, called Marshall, as if hee had beene <hi>Mars</hi> his Seneschall while in Ireland hee gave himselfe to slaughter, and burning, and got to himselfe large posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, he tooke away by strong hand and injuriously, from an holy Bishop two mannors or Lordships belonging to his Church, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously usurped them, as though he might, by just title pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse them, as if he had wonne them with the sword. The Bishop af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many admonitions, and receiving many froward answers, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred against him (and not without cause) the sentence of Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, the which the Earle despised, and pleaded for excuse; the warlike season keeping injuries upon injuries: Whereupon not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out advisement one Maister <hi>Gervasius de Melckeria,</hi> framed of him this distinction and shrowded himselfe in his person.</p>

                  <p>The meaning in a word is, how that he in his time had tamed the wild Irish, and had beene the shining beame of honour unto the English, as an Ambassadour to pacifie the Normans, and an invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Knight among the French nation, but forwards with <hi>Paris</hi>; the aforesaid Earle held those mannors all his life time, and annexed them unto his dominions: Within a few yeeres after, the Earle en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the way of all flesh, and was buried in the new Temple at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; the Bishop hearing of this (for he was the Bishop of Fernes, a Cistertian Monke, by birth Irish, and famous for Sanctity) not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great paine in travaile, he went unto the King, who then was in London, exhibited a grievous complaint of the injury done unto him, and how that hee had justly excommunicated the Earle, and humbly besought the King, that by his soveraigne authority and Princely mandat, and also for the good of the said Earle <hi>Williams</hi> soule, he would see his mannors restored unto him, that in so doing (though he were dead) yet might reape the benefit of absolution. The King with this was moved, and willed the Bishop to repaire to the Earles grave and absolve him, and he would diligently labour for his satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; the Bishop together with the King went to his Tombe, and in the hearing of al that were present, as if they had been both alive, said, O <hi>William,</hi> that here lyest interred, and wrapped in the bonds of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, if the thing which thou hast injuriously taken away from my Church, bee restored by the king, or by thine heire, or by some one of thy kindred or friends, with competent satisfaction, I absolve thee, o her wise I doe ratifie the said sentence that thou being ever wrapped in thy sinnes, maiest remaine damned in hell. The King hearing this, was moved and sharply rebuked the immoderat rigour of the Pontificall Prelate. To whom the Bishop replied, my Lord ann dread soveraigne, marvaile not, though I be out of patience, for he hath spoiled my Church to his great commoditie. The King then secretly conferring with <hi>William</hi> the eldest sonne of this Earle, and heire to the whole, and now invested in the inheritance and Earle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and certaine others his brethren, besought them by the resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the mannors unjustly taken away, mercifully to deliver their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers soule; To whom <hi>William</hi> the heir made answer, I doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, neither is to be credited, that my father tooke them injuriously, for that which is gotten by the sword, may lawfully be enjoyed; for if that old and doting Bishop hath given a wrong sentence, let the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:18659:168"/>
curse light upon his owne pate. I will not weaken my estate, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish the inheritance wherein I am invested, my father dyed seized thereof, and I have rightly entred. Vnto these words all the brethren yeelded their consents. The King being then of tender yeeres, and under Tutor, would not give cause of heavinesse unto so great and Noble a personage; when the Bishop understood this, hee was more waspish, and moved with the countenance of the sonnes, then with the former iniury of the father, and turning him to the King, spake aloud; what I have said, I have said; what I have written, I have written, never to be blotted out.</p>
                  <p>To be short, the Bishop with great sorrow departed, and in bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, prophecied of the ill successe of the children, who dyed and lived in great honour all the dayes of their lives: but these matters we are to referre to the secret iudgement of God.</p>
                  <p>After the decease of these five brethren, five Earles, and five Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Leinster, leaving no issue behinde them, the five daughters their sisters, <hi>Ioane, Mathilda, Isabell, Sibilla,</hi> and <hi>Eva,</hi> being honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly matched, had their fathers and brethrens possessions and territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in Ireland orderly divided amongst them; <hi>Ioane,</hi> the eldest daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>William</hi> Earle Marshall, and eldest sister of the five brethren (before spoken of) was married to <hi>Warren de Mountchensen,</hi> who in right of her, had allotted unto him, the County of Wexford; they had issue, one daughter, <hi>Ioane</hi> that was married, <hi>Anno</hi> 1247. to <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam de Valence,</hi> a Norman, the sonne of <hi>Hugh Brune,</hi> Earle of March, and <hi>Turryn,</hi> Vicount of Curce, &amp;c. hee was halfe brother to King <hi>Henry</hi> the third, by Queene <hi>Isabell,</hi> daughter and heire of <hi>Amerie,</hi> Earle of Angolesm, the widdow of King <hi>Iohn.</hi> This <hi>William</hi> in the right of his wife, was Earle of Penbroke, and Lord of Wexford, and died <hi>Anno</hi> 1296. he had issue, two sonnes and two daughters, <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am de Valence, Owdomare alias Aimer de Valence, Isabell</hi> and <hi>Ioane; William</hi> succeeded his father in the Earldome of Penbroke, and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Wexford, and died without issue. <hi>Aymer</hi> his brother after him, was Earle of Penbroke, and Lord of Wexford, and died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out issue, whereupon the inheritance fell to the two sisters, <hi>Isabell</hi> and <hi>Ioane.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1190.

                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In this voyage and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the recovery of Ierusalem, and the ayde of the Christians in Asia, there went <hi>Fredericke,</hi> Emperour of Almaine, <hi>Richard,</hi> King of England, <hi>Philip</hi> of France, <hi>VVilliam</hi> of Cicilia, <hi>Otho,</hi> Duke of Burgundie, the Venetians, Pisanes, Frisones, Danes and Flemings.

In the end, he went to Scotland, and there died. There are memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acts reported of him, which I hold not for truth, that he would shoot an arrow a mile off, and a great deale more; but them I leave a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the lyes of the land.</p>

Hee was first married to <hi>Isabell</hi> (whom the Britaines called <hi>Hawise,</hi> and the Cornish <hi>Avis</hi>) daughter to <hi>Robert</hi> Earle of Glocester, who for that they were found within the third degree, were divorced, so that King <hi>Iohn</hi> left both the Lady <hi>Isabell</hi> and the Earledome of Glocester, whereupon by the advice of <hi>Philip</hi> King of France, he matched in holy wedlocke with <hi>Isabell</hi> daughter to <hi>Amerie,</hi> Earle of Angolesme. This <hi>Isabell</hi> (if not married) had beene affianced to <hi>Hugh Brune,</hi> Earle of March, a Noble man of Aquitaine, who gave battaile in that quarell to King <hi>Iohn,</hi> and was discomfitted, yet after the death of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> hee had her to wife.</p>
                  <p>Immediatly upon the Coronation of <hi>Henry</hi> the third (who suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him) broyles beganne in England, France and Ireland, which had every way a tragicall end. <hi>Bruse</hi> in England, <hi>Arthure</hi> in France, and <hi>Courcy</hi> in Ireland, are testimonies thereof: But orderly of these as the Nature of the Historie requires; <hi>Arthure</hi> the sonne of <hi>Ieffry Plantagenet</hi> nephew to King <hi>Iohn,</hi> lived when his uncle <hi>Iohn</hi> aspired to the Crowne, being 16 yeeres of age, he was affianced to a daughter of <hi>Philippe</hi> the French King, the said <hi>Philippe</hi> Knighted him in the field; he was Duke of Britain, Earle of Anjou, Poitiers, Maine and Turrow of Normandy. He did homage unto his uncle for some, and to <hi>Philippe</hi> for the rest; his uncle had him in Iealousie, first lest that in processe of time, he would make claime to the Crowne: secondly, for that he adhered too much to the French, and the young Prince upon conference, with bold spirit told him, that he did him wrong, and that hee was bound in honour to deliver unto him the Crowne of England, with all that thereunto appertained. Shortly after, it fell
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:18659:171"/>
out that King <hi>Iohn</hi> took this <hi>Arthure</hi> confederate against him, with <hi>William de Bruse, Hugh Brune</hi> and others, imprisoned him in Falaise in Normandy; from thence he was brought to Roane, and there clapt in the Tower, under the custody of <hi>Robert de Veipont,</hi> where shortly after he finished his life, whether by leaping into the ditch, thinking to make his escape, or by meane of some privy hand, which murther it is not as yet agreed upon <hi>Vtinam</hi> (saith <hi>Mat. Paris) non ut fama refert invida</hi>; by occasion whereof, K. <hi>Iohn</hi> was ever after had in great suspition, whether justly or unjustly the Lord knoweth King <hi>Iohn</hi> fearing the secret practises of his adversaries, and doubting the revolt of his Barons, sent for his further security, unto those whom he most suspected for hostages and pledges of their Ioialty, and among others, unto <hi>William de Bruse</hi> a Normand borne, but Lord of <hi>Brechnok,</hi> saith <hi>Guttin Owen,</hi> and a great commander in South-wales. The wife, like a quicke Dame, taking the answer out of her husbands mouth, gave this round speech; that shee would not give any of her sonnes to King <hi>Iohn,</hi> who already had slaine and murthered his owne nephew <hi>Arthur.</hi> These words being lavishly delivered unto the King, set him in such a heat of displeasure against her husband (though hee had rebuked her sharply for the same) that the L. <hi>Bruse</hi> with his wife and children fled the Realme, and got them unto Ireland for safeguard of their lives; and when King <hi>Iohn</hi> came unto Ireland, they fled to the Ile of Man, where they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and sent to the Castle of Windsore in England, and there (as the common fame went) famished to death. But <hi>William de Bruse</hi> himselfe escaped the hands of the King in Ireland, and fled into France, died at Corbell, and was buried in Paris. The next that comes upon the stage is Sir <hi>Iohn de Courcy</hi> Earle of Vlster, Lord of Conaght, that had lastly beene L. Liev. of Ireland, who governing the land with great circumspection, together with Sir <hi>Hugh de Lacy</hi> the younger, who maligned him secretly, and envied his prosperity, in so much that hee accused him to King <hi>Iohn,</hi> saying, that he laid to the Kings charge the murthering of his nephew <hi>Arthure</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon King <hi>Iohn</hi> sent for him into England; and gave commission unto Sir <hi>Hugh de Lacy,</hi> and his brother <hi>Walter Delacy,</hi> to attach his person. Sir <hi>Iohn de Courcy</hi> having secret intelligence of their drift, kept himselfe a loofe: Sir <hi>Hugh Delacy</hi> finding that levied an army, and invaded Vlster; the Country rose against him and drove him to flie. Then <hi>Lacy</hi> praclaimed him traitor, and marched towards him with all the forces he could make. <hi>Courcy</hi> in like sort prepared for his comming.</p>
                  <p>At Dune they met and fought a cruell battaile, where the field was all blood, and many slaine on both sides, but in the end the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fell to <hi>Courcy,</hi> and <hi>Lacy</hi> went back with shame enough. Then <hi>Lacy</hi> practised how he might betray him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:18659:171"/>It is said among the Irish, that <hi>Courcy</hi> offred the combat, and that <hi>Lacy</hi> refused it, aleadging that it was not for him, that represented the Kings person, to hazard his life with an inferior, being a subject and a traytor.<hi>Lacy</hi> makes proclamation, promising a large reward to him that should bring him in <hi>Courcy</hi> either alive or dead, but it would not be; then privily he dealt with some of his servants, that if they would undertake the apprehension of him, they should have great rewards; it was concluded, and this advice the betraiers gave: Sir <hi>Iohn de Courcy</hi> is a mighty man in armes, and of such strength, that no one man dares be so hardy as lay hand upon him, and againe hee is alwaies both in publick and privat well provided: Yet we can di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you a course to bring your purpose to effect: upon good Friday yeerly he weares no armes, but is wholly given to divine contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and commonly walketh all solitary round about the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of Dune: if you provide a troope of horsemen in a readinesse, and send your espiall before, there you shall have him, apprehend him and worke your will, and hither they came, and laid hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. <hi>Courcy</hi> now unarmed and altogether distressed; ranne to a wooden crosse that stood in the Church yard, tooke the pole therof and laid about him lustily; <hi>Courcy</hi> at that time had but a few atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on him, and they armelesse; of which number, were two young Gentlemen, the sonnes of Sir <hi>Amorick Saint Laurence</hi> which were slaine; to bee short, the Author of the Booke of <hi>Houth</hi> reporteth, that <hi>Courcy</hi> in that Skirmish slew 13. of <hi>Lacy</hi> his men, that died not upon the Crosse, but under the Crosse, but in the end he was carried away, conveied beyond the seas, clapt in the Towre of London, and condemned to perpetuall imprisonment: Whereupon <hi>Lacy</hi> for that service, had the Earledome of Vlster given him, and the Iudases that betrayed their Master had their hire. Then they craved of Sir <hi>Hugh de Lacy</hi> a pasport into England, with the relation of the good service they had done in Ireland, which was granted upon condition, that upon the paine of death, they should never returne into Ireland a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, neither to open the same afore it were demanded of them: It was as followeth.</p>

them no Pilots nor sea-faring men, for want of skill they could not take the seas, but were tossed with winde and weather, along the Coast, at length the Tyde brought them into the river of Corke: they were no sooner landed, but they were apprehended, examined, and brought to Sir <hi>Hugh de Lacy,</hi> and forthwith all foure hanged cheeke by jole.</p>
                  <p>Not long after, there fell some difference betweene <hi>Iohn,</hi> King of England, and <hi>Philip,</hi> King of France, for the right of some Fort in Normandie, who to avoyde the shedding of Christian bloud, agreed of each side to put it to a combat; of King <hi>Philips</hi> part there was a French man in readinesse; King <hi>Iohn</hi> upon the sudden wist not what to doe for a Champion to encounter with him; at length, one attending upon his person, enformed him that there was one <hi>Courcy</hi> in the Towre of London, the onely man in his dominions (if hee would undertake it) to answer the challenge. King <hi>Iohn</hi> ioyfull of this, sent the first, yea second, and third time, promising large re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and rich gifts, and that it stood him upon as farre as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his Crowne and kingdome did reach, to make good the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. <hi>Courcy</hi> answered very frowardly, (the which was taken in good part in regard of the urgent necessitie) that he would never fight for him, neither for any such as he was, that he was not worthy to have one drop of bloud spilt for him; that he was not able to requite him the wrongs he had done him, neither to restore him the hearts ease he had bereaved him of: yet notwithstanding all the premises, he was willing, and would with all expedition, be ready to venture his life in defence of the Crowne and his country. Whereupon it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, that he should be dyeted, apparrelled, and armed to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and that his owne sword should be brought him out of Ireland. The day came, the place appointed, the Liste provided, the scaffolds set up, the Princes with their nobilitie of each side, with thousands in expectation. Forth comes the French Champion, gave a turne, and rests him in his tent: They sent for <hi>Courcy,</hi> who all this while was trussing of himselfe about with strong poynts, and answered the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers, if any of their company were to goe to such a banquet, I thinke he would make no great haste. Forth he comes, gave a turne, and went into his Tent. When the Trumpets sounded to battaile, forth come the combatants, and viewed each other. <hi>Courcy</hi> beheld him with a wonderfull sterne countenance, and passed by. The French man not liking his grimme looke, the strong proportion and feature of his person, stalked still along, and when the Trumpets soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the last charge, <hi>Courcy</hi> drew out his sword, and the French man ranne away, and conveyed him to Spaine. Whereupon they soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded victory, the people clapt their hands, and cast up their cappes; King <hi>Philip</hi> desired King <hi>Iohn</hi> that <hi>Courcy</hi> might bee called before them, to shew some part of his strength and manhood, by a blow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:18659:172"/>
on a Helmet; it was agreed, a stake was set in the ground, and a shirt of maile, and a Helmet thereon; <hi>Courcy</hi> drew his sword, looked won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull sternely upon the Princes, cleft the helmet, the shirt of maile, and the stake so farre in, that none could pull it out but himselfe. Then the Princes demanded of him, what hee meant to looke so sowrely upon them; his answer was, if hee had missed his blow upon the blocke, he would have cut off both the Kings heads. All that hee said was taken in good part: King <hi>Iohn</hi> discharged him out of all his troubles, gave him great gifts, and restored him to his former posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in Ireland. It is written further, that hereupon hee sailed into England, came to Westchester, offered himselfe to the sea, and was put backe againe fifteene times by contrary windes which rose upon a sodaine, to the English shore. And in the booke of <hi>Houth</hi> it is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, that upon every repulse, the night following, he was admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in a vision, not to attempt the seas, for to saile into Ireland, and that he should never set foot upon any land there; and withall, that the reason was yeelded thus. <hi>Courcy,</hi> thou hast done very ill, for thou hast pulled downe the master, and set up the servant; for he had trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the Cathedrall Church, and the Prebendaries of the blessed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie in Dune, into an Abbey of blacke Monkes, brought thither from Chester, and consecrated the same to the honour of Saint <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricke.</hi> Whereupon remembring himselfe that he had done very ill in taking the name from God to a creature, gave sentence upon himself, that he was worthily punished. Immediately hee altered his course, went into France, and there died: now forwards with the history, according to the due course of time in the raigne of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> so the booke of <hi>Houth</hi> reporteth.</p>

(<hi>Reguli</hi>) of the chiefest rulers within Ireland, which came to the King to Dublin, and there did him homage and fealty, as appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. <hi>Harding</hi> nameth them Lord <hi>O Neale,</hi> and many more. <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>singham</hi> remembreth <hi>Catelus</hi> King of Conaght, it forceth it not though they misse the right names of place and person; it is a fault in manner common to all foraigne writers.</p>
                  <p>After this hee marched forwards into the land, and tooke into his hands, divers Fortresses, and strong Holds of his enemies, that fled before him, for feare to be apprehended; as <hi>William le Bruse, Mathilda</hi> his wife, <hi>William</hi> their sonne with their traine, of whom I spake before; also <hi>Walter de Lacy</hi> Lord of Meath, and <hi>Hugh de Lacy</hi> Earle of Vlster, and Lord Iustice of Ireland, fearing his presence, fled into France; their exaction, oppression and tyranny was intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Likewise they doubted how to answer the death of Sir <hi>Iohn de Courcy</hi> Lord of Ratheny and Kilbarrock within 5. miles of Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blin, whom they had murthered, of especiall malice and deadly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.</p>
                  <p>First, for that he was of the house of Sir <hi>Iohn de Courcy,</hi> Earle of Vlster, (whom the <hi>Lacies</hi> alwaies maligned.)</p>
                  <p>Secondly, for that he had made grievous complaints of them in England to King <hi>Iohn,</hi> the tryall whereof they could not abide. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the sight of the <hi>Lacies,</hi>

                  <p>King <hi>Iohn</hi> having pacified the land, ordained that the English Lawes should bee used in Ireland, appointed 12.

                  <p>The English Chronicle of Ireland delivereth that hee was made Lord Iustice <hi>Anno</hi> 1228. <hi>Florilegus</hi> and <hi>Holinshed</hi> write, that he was removed from his Iusticeship, <hi>Anno</hi> 1245. and <hi>Iohn Fitz Ieffery</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted in his roome. <hi>Mathew Paris</hi> writeth that hee was removed, <hi>Anno</hi> 1248 but howsoever they have mistaken the yeeres, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the fault of the Printer crept in, it forceth not; I am to deliver to the reader, the truth of the history, and the most worthy service of this Noble man, with the yeeres and the time as neere as I can.</p>

Ireland sent likewise after their money, Irish curses, for they were driven at the worst hand to sell unto the mercilesse Merchants, their Cowes, Hackneyes, Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, and Aqua vitae, to make present payment, and were driven in that extremitie, to pawne and sell their Cups, Chalices, Copes, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar-clothes and vestments.</p>

secondly, to cleare himselfe of the death of <hi>Richard Marshall</hi> Earle of Pembrook: lastly, with Irish forces against the Welshmen. <hi>Mat. Paris</hi> and <hi>Holinshed,</hi> make report of his good service; How that when an Irish petit King in Conaght, understanding that both the King of England, and the Earle <hi>Marshall</hi> and <hi>Maurice Fitz Gerald</hi> were gone over into France, and so Ireland left without any great aide of men of warre, on the English part, raised a mighty Army, and with the same entred into the Marches and borders of the English dominion, spoiling and burning the Country before him. And how that <hi>Ief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray de Maurisco</hi> then Lord Iustice, being thereof advertized; called to him <hi>Walter de Lacy,</hi> Lord of Meth, and <hi>Richard de Burgh,</hi> assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling therewithall an hugh Army, the which he divided into three parts, appointing the said <hi>Walter de Lacy</hi> and <hi>Richard de Burgh</hi> with the two first parts, to lye in ambush within certain Woods, through the which he purposed to draw the enemies. And marching forth with the third, which he reserved to his owne government, he profered battaile to the Irishmen, the which when they saw but one battaile of the Englishmen, boldly assaid the same.</p>
                  <p>The Englishmen according to the order appointed, faining as though they had fled and so retired still backe, till they had trained the Irish within danger of their other two battailes which comming forth upon them, did set on them eagerly; whilest the other which seemed before to fly, returned back againe, and set upon them in like manner; by meanes whereof, the Irish men being in the midst were beaten downe: if they stood to it, they were before and behind slaine; if any offered to fly hee was overtaken, thus in all parts they were utterly vanquished, with the losse of 20000. Irish, and the King of Conaght taken and committed to prison. This Noble <hi>Ieffray de Marisco</hi> (of whom <hi>Holinshed</hi> writeth) a man some time in great honour and possessions in Ireland, fell into the displeasure of the King, was banished; who after he had remained long in exile, suffred great miserie, ended the same by naturall death: Thus the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable Wheele goeth round about: and <hi>yet I may not so leave it hee had a sonne called</hi> William de Maurisco, <hi>who together with the father (the Iustice of God requiring the same) came to most shamefull ends:</hi> Matthew <hi>the Munke of Westminster and</hi> Matthew Paris <hi>the Munke of Saint Albones, doe write the Story: While the King was beyond seas, a certain noble man of Irish birth to wit</hi> Willielmus de Maurisco, <hi>an exiled and banished man, the sonne of</hi> Ieffray de Maurisco, <hi>for some hainous offence laid to his charge, kept himselfe in the Isle of Lun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, not farre from Bristall, preying, robbing and stealing, as a notorious Pirate; at length being apprehended, together with</hi> 17. <hi>of his confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, and by the Kings commandement adjudged to cruell death; he was drawne at London with his confederats, at horse tailes to the Gibbet, and there hanged and quartered: His father one of the mightiest men of

                     <hi>These things therefore I deliver more at large unto the hearers, that every man may wey with himselfe, what end is alloted unto treason, and especially being committed against the sacred person of a Prince: His father against</hi> Richard <hi>Earle and Marshall in Ireland, and his son</hi> William <hi>against the King, unadvisedly and unfortunatly adventured to practice mischiefe.</hi>

                     <hi>Paris</hi> addeth the name of this <hi>William</hi> was very odious unto the King, for so much it was reported, that through the councell of <hi>Ief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray</hi> his father, he had conspired the death of the King, and that he had traitorously sent that varlet, which came in the night season, to Woodstock to slay the King, and last of all, that hee had killed at London in presence of the King; one <hi>Clemens,</hi> a Clerk, messenger of some Noble man of Ireland, that came to informe the King a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</p>
                  <p>About this same time, florished a Learned man of Irish birth, one <hi>Cornelius Historicus,</hi> so called, because hee was an exquisit anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary Bale: and <hi>Stanihurst</hi> have briefly written his life and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandations out of <hi>Hector Boetius,</hi> who was greatly furthered by this <hi>Cornelius,</hi> to the perfecting of the Scotish History, hee wrote as they say:

                  <p>About this time, <hi>Viz. Anno</hi> 1230. there rose a doubt in Ireland, so that they sent to England to be therein resolved: the King, by his learned Councell answered as followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Henry by the grace of God, &amp;c. King of England, Lord of Ireland, Duke of Normandy and Guian, &amp;c. Trusty and welbeloved</hi> Gerald Fitz Maurice <hi>Iusticer of Ireland, greeting; VVhereas certien Knights of the parties of Ireland lately informed us; that when any land doth discend unto sisters, within our dominion of Ireland, the Iustices errant in those parties are in doubt, whether the younger sister ought to hold of the eldest sister, and doe homage unto her or not. And forasmuch as the said Knights have made instance, to bee certified how it had beene used before within our Realme of England in like case; at their instance we doe you wit, that such a Law and Custome is in England in this case, that if any holding of us in chief, happen to die, having daughters to his heires our ancestors, and we after the death of the father, have
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:18659:177"/>
alway had and received homage of all the daughters, and every of them in this case did hold of us in chiefe. And if they happned to be within age, we have alway had the ward and marriage of them, and if hee bee tennant to another Lord, the sisters being within age, the Lord shall have the ward and manage of them all, and the eldest onely shall doe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage for herselfe, and all her sisters, and when the other sisters come to full age, they shall doe their service to the Lord of the fee, by the hands of the eldest sister; yet shall not the eldest by this occasion, exact of her younger sisters homage, ward, or any other subjection; for when they be all sisters, and in manner, as one heire to one inheritance: if the eldest should have homage of the other sister, or demaund ward, then the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance should seeme to be divided so, that the eldest sister should seeme to be segnioresse and tennant of inheritance,</hi> simul &amp; semel, <hi>that is to say, heire of her owne part, and segnioresse to her sisters, which could not stand well together in this case, for the eldest can demaund no more then her sisters; but the chiefe mease by reason of her auncienty. Moreover, if the eldest sister should take homage of the yonger, she should be as a seg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nioresse to them all, and should have the ward of them and their heires, which should be none other, but but to cast the Lambe to the Wolfe to be devoured.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And therefore wee command you that you cause the aforesaid cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes that bee used within our Realme of England, in this case to bee proclaimed throughout our dominions of Ireland, and to be straightly kept and observed, in testimony whereof, &amp;c. I witnesse my selfe at Westminster, the ninth of February, the thirteeneth yeere of our Raigne.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1233. or as some will have it, 1234. the 7. of <hi>Aprill,</hi> there appeared as it were foure Sunnes, besides the naturall Sunne, of a red colour, and a great Circle of Christall colour; from the sides whereof went out halfe Circles; in the divisions whereof, the foure Sunnes went forth. There followed that yeere great warre and cruell bloodshed, &amp; general great disturbance throughout England, Wales, and Ireland, so write <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> and <hi>Stow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This troublesome yeere died <hi>Gualter Lacy</hi> Lord of Meath, leaving behind him two daughters, coheires to inherit his possession (to wit) <hi>Margret</hi> that was maried to the Lord <hi>Theobald Verdon</hi> and <hi>Mathilda</hi> married to <hi>Ieffray Genevile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Amids these troubles in the flourishing daies of <hi>Maurice Fitz Gerald, Hubert de Burgo, Ieffray de Morisco,</hi> and <hi>Gualter de Lacy,</hi> whose ends followed according: The Noble Earle <hi>Richard Maxfield</hi> Lord Maxfield, Earle Marshall of England, spoken of before, and being by them maligned, was traitorously cut off by sundry devilish draughts. <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> wrot the Story at large, laid downe their practise on both the sides of the seas, their forged letters; and secretly as it were by stealth, fixing thereto the Kings seale: Hee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth

them traitors, Iudasses; and <hi>Ieffery de Morisco</hi> he termeth <hi>Achi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tophell</hi> that gave wicked counsell. <hi>Hubert</hi> had a lamentable end, <hi>Ieffery</hi> dyed in misery, <hi>Lacy</hi> was shortly cut off, and <hi>Maurice Fitz Girald</hi> was with dishonour removed from his Iusticeship. This <hi>Maurice</hi> of the King desired to bee reconciled to <hi>Gilbert Marshall</hi> his brother, whom he greatly feared, and offered in satisfaction to build with all speed, a noble Monastery, and to endow the same with large posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and to furnish it with a reverent covent, to pray for the soule of <hi>Richard Marshall</hi>: at length with much adoe, and importunate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty of the King and Nobility of England, <hi>Gilbert Marshall</hi> granted him peace; but of Earle <hi>Richards</hi> end I have spoken somewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>About the yeere 1233. or 34. <hi>Hugh Mapleton,</hi> Bishop of Ossorie, whose Episcopall see was then at Achboo, in upper Ossorie, began the foundation of the Cathedrall Church, now standing in the Irish towne of Kilkenny, in the honour of God and Saint <hi>Canicus,</hi> (of whom the towne of Kilkenny hath the name) and is reckoned the first founder. Hee ordained three Canons for the service, hee gave them divers Churches and tithes for their maintenance, as in the foundation of those Chanons more at large doth appeare. He builded the Bishops Court of Aghor, adding thereto fish-ponds, fishings, and other necessaries. Such good men lived in those dayes.</p>
                  <p>At the same time came the King of Connaught, exhibiting a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous complaint unto <hi>Henry</hi> the third (saith <hi>Mathew Paris</hi>) against <hi>Iohn de Burgo,</hi> the sonne, as I suppose, of <hi>Hubert de Burgo</hi> before spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of; that he had entred his country with forces, and wasted the same with fire and sword, that it would please his Majestie to doe him justice, and command such rash attempts to be bridled, alledging that he was his loyall subject, and paid for his kingdome, an annuall pension, mounting to the summe of 5000<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> marks, ever since King <hi>Iohn</hi> had subdued his kingdome, and that he would rid him of that base upstart, or new commer which sought unjustly to disherit him. The King tendred his reasonable requests, and commanded <hi>Maurice Fitz Girald</hi> then present, to plucke up by the roote, the fruitlesse Plant, the which <hi>Hubert</hi> Earle of Kent had sometime planted in those parts, while he was in Ruffe, that it might budde no more. Hee wrote also unto the Nobilitie of Ireland, that they should banish the said <hi>Iohn de Burgo,</hi> and peaceably establish the King in his kingdome, who with these princely favours, joyfully returned into his country.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1235. (saith <hi>Cooper</hi>) the Irish men rebelled; so hee left it, and so I leave it too.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1236. <hi>Mathew Paris</hi> doth write that in the North parts not farre from the Abbey of Rochor Rupie, and also in Ireland, and the parts there abouts more apparantly, strange and wonderfull sights were seene, which amazed the beholders: to wit, there appeared
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:18659:178"/>
comming forth of the earth, companies of armed men on horseback, with Speare, Shield, Sword, and banners displaid in sundry formes and shapes, riding in battaile array, and encountring together; and this sight appeared sundry dayes each after other; sometimes they seemed to joyne as it had beene in battaile, and fought sore; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they seemed to just and breake staves, as if it had beene at some triumphant justs of torny. The people of the country beheld them a farre off with great wonder, for the skirmish shewed it selfe so live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that now and then they might see them come with their empty horses, sore wounded and hurt, and likewise men mangled and blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; A pittifull fight to behold, and that which seemed more strange, and most to be mervailed at, after they vanished away, the prints of their feet appeared in the ground, and the grasse trodden in those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they had beene seene.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1240. <hi>Petrus de Supino</hi> came from Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> into Ireland, with an authenticke papall mandate,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Petrus de Supino &amp; Petrus Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beus,</hi> Pope <hi>Gregories</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, were rifled of all they had by the Emperour.</note> requiring under paine of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, and other censures ecclesiasticall the twentieth part part of the whole land, besides donatives and private gratuities to the maintenance of his warres against <hi>Fredericke</hi> the Emperour, where he extorted, saith <hi>Mathew Paris,</hi> a thousand and five hundred markes, and above, saith <hi>Florilegus</hi>; at which time also one <hi>Petrus Pubeus,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled the Popes Familiar, and kinsman, and both bastards, saith <hi>Bale,</hi> filled in like sort his fardles in Scotland. These Nuntioes were so craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they needed no Brokers, they secretly understood by Posts and Cursitors, the state of the Court of Rome, which quailed them full sore, that the Pope was either gone, or panted for life; secretly by the conduct of the Monkes of Canterbury, they were conveyed to Dover, where they tooke shipping, and crossed the seas. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Fredericke,</hi> against whom this provision was made, having intelligence thereof, and secretly acquainted with the Popes state, wrote to the King of England to apprehend such prollers, wherein he also reproved his cowardize. The Emperour when he understood that the birds were flowne away, made search for the neast, yet over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke them in Italy; where, to be short, hee imprisoned them, their kindred and favourers rifled them of their money, and sent them to Rome to sing for more money: he that will reade the story more at large, let him repaire to <hi>Mathew Paris.</hi>

                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1243. <hi>Clun</hi> and <hi>Dowlinge</hi> write, that <hi>Giraldus Fitz Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:18659:178"/>
Richardus de Burgo,</hi> and <hi>Hugh de Lacy,</hi> Earle of Vlster in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, ended the way of all flesh, and was buried at Carechfergus. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew Paris</hi> giveth <hi>Lacy</hi> great commendations, that he was a most renowned warriour, and a valiant Conquerour of a great part of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. This <hi>Lacy</hi> left behinde him one daughter and heire, whom <hi>Walter de Burgo</hi> married, and in her right, became Earle of Vlster: of <hi>Richardus de Burgo, Mathew Paris</hi> writeth he had great possessions and lands in Ireland, by the conquest of his most Noble father.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1245. <hi>Florilegus, Powell</hi> (out of <hi>Gittin Owen</hi>) and <hi>Holinshed,</hi> doe write how that the Welch men rebelled against the King, and his forces being foyled by <hi>David ap Llewelin</hi> Prince of Wales, hee sent into Ireland to <hi>Maurice</hi> for ayde, and was in winter time mightily distressed, the which I finde by <hi>Powell</hi> recorded and written by a Noble man out of the campe unto his friends.</p>
                  <p>The King with his army lyeth at Gannocke, fortifying of that strong Castle, and we live in our Tents, thereby watching, fasting, praying, and freezing with cold; wee watch for feare of the Welch men, who are wont to invade and come upon us in the night time; we fast for want of meate, for the halfe penny loafe is worth five pence; we pray to God to send us home speedily; we starve for cold, wanting our winter garments, and having no more but a thinne lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen cloath betweene us and the winde; there is an arme of the seas un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Castle where we lye, whereto the tyde commeth, and many shippes come up to the haven, which bring victuals to the Campe, from Ireland and Chester. The King all this while expected the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivall of <hi>Maurice Fitz Girald,</hi> with his Irish forces, mused with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, fretted with himselfe, the winde serving, and yet said nothing; at length the Irish sayles are discryd, a shore they came, and <hi>Maurice Fitz Girald,</hi> (together with <hi>Phelina, Oconor) Oconoghor,</hi> saith another in battaile array, present themselves before the King at Chepstow, say the Irish Chroniclers, but the British Chroniclers coppied out of the Abbies of <hi>Conwey</hi> and <hi>Stratflur,</hi> by <hi>Owen Gittine,</hi> deliver they landed at the Ile of Man or Anglesey, the which in mine opinion see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be most likely to be true. For <hi>David ap Llewelin</hi> was Prince of North-Wales, and there kept his forces, &amp; Chepstow is in South-Wales; and besides, it is agreed upon of all sides, that the Irish lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, spoyled the Ile of Anglesey, laded themselves with spoyles, and going to their ships, were driven to runne and leave all behinde; but to be short, when all the forces joyned together, the Welch men were overthrowne; the King manned and victualled his Castles, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into England, gave the Irish men leave to returne, winking a while in policie at the tarriance and slow comming of <hi>Maurice Fitz Girald</hi>: when <hi>Maurice Fitz Girald,</hi> Lord Iustice arrived in Ireland, he found <hi>O Donell</hi> the Irish enemy, upon the death of <hi>Hugh Lacy,</hi> in Armes, invading and sore annoying the Kings subjects in Vlster, and
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:18659:179"/>
called unto him <hi>Cormake Mac Dermot Mac Dory,</hi> with great forces, and entred Tireconell, preyed, burned, and spoyled, and vanquished the enemy; there he slue <hi>Moyleslaghlon O Donell,</hi> called King of Key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vayle, together with <hi>Gille Canvinelagh, Obugill,</hi> and <hi>Mac Surley,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led King of Oyrisgall, with divers others, gentlemen of those parts: in like sort many English men were cast away in the river, whose pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage <hi>O Donell</hi> stopped, and slue there <hi>William Butt,</hi> high Sheriffe of Connaught, together with a valiant young Gentleman his brother. When the Lord Iustice had thus atchieved his purpose, hee manned and victualled the Castle of Sligo, tooke pledges of <hi>O Neale</hi> to keepe the Kings peace, and left them in the said Castle, gave <hi>Cormake Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot Mac Dory</hi> that came to his aide, the moytie of Connaught, and returned with a great prey.</p>
                  <p>When this noble service was performed, the King disgorged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and what inwardly he had conceived, and for a while concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved against the Lord Iustice,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iohn Fitz Ieffery</hi> Lord Iustice, <hi>Anno</hi> 1245.</note> he then in writing delivered, and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>Maurice Fitz Girald</hi> out of his Iusticeship, and placed in his roome, <hi>Iohn Fitz Ieffery de Morisco,</hi> the which the Irish Chroniclers have suppressed, yet <hi>Florilegus</hi> and <hi>Holinshed</hi> doe write, <hi>Mauritium Hiberniae Iustitiariu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eo quod ficte &amp; tarde auxilium ab hibernia domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Regi duxerat periclitanti a Iustitiaria Deposuit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Maurice</hi> departed out of this world, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1256. was buried saith <hi>Clyn</hi> in the habit of the Fryers Minors at Yough-halle, the which <hi>Morice</hi> had founded, of whom <hi>Mathew Paris</hi> saith thus; he was a valiant Knight, a very pleasant man, inferiour to none in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, who sometime swayed the land when hee had the sword of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticeship; this man lived with commendations all the dayes of his life, but peradventure falsly reported of, and stained in the end with the death of <hi>Richard,</hi> Earle Marshall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1247. after that <hi>Henry</hi> the third, and the Clergie of England and Ireland found themselves mightily grieved at the Popes exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and intollerable extortions in England, Wales, and Ireland, and had signified the same in writing to the Court of Rome; whereupon saith <hi>Florilegus,</hi> the Court of Rome fretted and sorrowed, that their avarice was as well reproved, as restrained. <hi>Innocentius</hi> 4. devised in his conceit, a milder course to be held, that in stead of a greater summe, they should give him at that time out of those dominions, to supply his wants, but eleven thousand markes. Then saith <hi>Florilegus,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster <hi>Iohannes Rusus</hi> was sent into Ireland, furnished with authority, diligently to collect the Popes money, as a Legate, yet not clad in scarlet, lest the Pope should offend the King of England, who hath this priviledge, that no Legate set foot on his land, unlesse hee be sent for, or licenced; but the said <hi>Iohn</hi> being a sophisticall Legate, vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly plying the papall mandate, and his owne private gaine, extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of Ireland, about sixe thousand markes; the which by the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:18659:179"/>
conduite of the Clergie, was transported and conveied to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, about the Feast of Saint <hi>Michaell</hi> the Archangell.</p>
                  <p>The same yeere, saith <hi>Florilegus,</hi> there was a marveilouse and strange Earthquake over England; but saith <hi>Felcon,</hi> over Ireland:<note place="margin">A great Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake.</note> And all the West of the world, and there followed immediatly a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all untemperature of the ayre, with a filthy skurfe; the Winter stor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my cold and wet, which continued untill the 11. of <hi>Iuly,</hi> and put the Gardeners, Fruterers, and Husbandmen void of all hope, in so much they complained that Winter was turned to Summer, and Summer to Winter, and that they were like to lose all, and bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1252. saith <hi>Dowling</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> and the English <hi>Anoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> but <hi>Clyn</hi> and <hi>Florilegus</hi> write, that it was 1254. King <hi>Henry</hi> gave to Prince <hi>Edward</hi> his sonne, Gascoigne, Ireland, Wales, Bristow, Stanford and Grantham, and sent him to <hi>Alphonsus</hi> King of Spaine, to take <hi>Ellionor</hi> his sister to wife, where hee was by the said King Knighted, and returned together with his wife into England, with great riches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1255. <hi>Alanus de la Zouch,</hi> was made Lord Iustice; so I finde in the Booke of <hi>Houth,</hi> after his departure out of Ireland, hee being a Lord Baron, and chiefe Iustice in England; <hi>Florilegus, Humfrey Loid</hi> and <hi>Stow,</hi> doe write the Story how hee came to his end; great strife rose in England, betweene certaine of the Nobility, about territories lands and titles, whereto each side made claime; the matters in controversie, by direction from the King were decided in Westminster Hall; the first Controversie was betweene <hi>Iohn</hi> Earle of Surrey and Warren, and <hi>Hugh de Lacy</hi> Earle of Lincolne, which went upon <hi>Lacy</hi> his side. The second was, betweene this Earle <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren</hi> and <hi>Allan de la Zouch,</hi> this <hi>Zouch</hi> being Chiefe Iustice asked Earle <hi>Warren,</hi> how he held his land, Earle <hi>Warran</hi> drew foorth his sword and said, by this mine Ancestors held the same, and by this I presently hold it, and with that ranne the Chiefe Iustice through in Westminster Hall, and in his flight wounded also his sonne; thence hee fled to his Castle at Risgate, whome Prince <hi>Edward</hi> the Kings eldest sonne pursued with an Army; to whom the Earle submitted himselfe, and afterwards with friends, and what with money paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1256. in the warres of <hi>Lewelin</hi> Prince of Wales, so I find in the records of <hi>Conway</hi> &amp; <hi>Stratflur</hi> Copied by <hi>Gettine Owen.</hi>

                     <hi>Edward</hi> Earle of Chester, fell to outrage one while against the King, another while against the Welshmen; his Army was 1500. foot and 500. horse. <hi>Henry</hi> the third together with <hi>Richard</hi> Earle of Cornewall, and King of Almane wrote unto him gently, wishing him to returne to his Country and keepe the peace, and not to provoke the Welshmen to Armes; the which he refused to doe, but sent to the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:18659:180"/>
Irishmen for succour and supplies. Prince <hi>Edward</hi> the Kings eldest sonne, understanding thereof, rigged a Navy, met with the Irish fleet, killed their men and sunck their ships, few onely remaining to returne, and to make report of this hard successe in Ireland; In a while after, the King raised warres against <hi>Lewellin</hi> Prince of Wales, and the Welshmen (saith <hi>Paris, Causa autem eorum etiam hostibus eorum justa videbatur,</hi>) and was brought to a narrow straight, so that he sent to Ireland, and to Gascoigne for succour; the Irishmen not forgetting their late overthrow, were loath to come (being of all sides driven to serve) in the end came, and joyned with their Kings forces, where no memorable act was performed, for God, saith <hi>Paris,</hi> defended the poore people that put their whole confidence in him.</p>

Vpon <hi>May</hi> Eve, <hi>Thomas Granly</hi> Archbishop of Dublin, went over into England, and deceased at Faringdon, but his body was buried in the New Colledge at Oxford. This man is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly praised for his liberality, he was a good almes-man, a great Clerk, a Doctor of Divinity, an excellent Preacher, a great builder, beautifull, courteous, of a sanguine complexion, and of a tall stature, in somuch as in his time it might be said unto him; <hi>Thou art fairer then the sons of men, grace and eloquence proceeded from thy lips</hi>: He was 80. yeeres of age when he died, and had governed the Church of Dublin almost 20. yeeres in great quiet.</p>

                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1418. The Annunciation of our Lady was in Easter weeke, and shortly after, the Lord Deputy spoiled the tenants of <hi>Henry Crus</hi> and <hi>Henry Bethat</hi>; also at Slane upon the feast day of S.

Vpon the 29. of <hi>Iune, Mathew Husseil</hi> Baron of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trim deceased, and was buried in the Covent of the Fryers Preachers of Trim.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1419. upon the eleventh of <hi>May,</hi> dayed <hi>Edmund Brel</hi> sometime Major of Dublin, and was buried at the Fryers Preachers of the same City. A Royall Councell was holden at the Naas, where were granted unto the Lord Lievtenant 300. markes. At the same time died Sir <hi>Iohn Loundres</hi> Knight.</p>
                  <p>The same yeere upon Cene thursday, <hi>Othoill</hi> tooke fowre hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Cowes belonging unto <hi>Balimore,</hi> breaking the peace, contrary to his oath: The fourth Ides of <hi>May, Mac Morthe,</hi> chiefe Captaine of his Nation, and of all the Irish in Leinster, was taken prisoner. And the same day, was Sir <hi>Hugh Cokesey</hi> made Knight. The last of <hi>May,</hi> the Lord Lievtenant and the Archbishop of Dublin, with the Major, rased the Castle of Kenini. The morrow after the feast of <hi>Processus</hi> and <hi>Martinianus,</hi> the Lord <hi>William de Burgh</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Englishmen, slue five hundred of the Irish, and tooke Okelly: On the feast day of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> the Lord Lievtenant <hi>Iohn Talbot</hi> went over into England; leaving his Deputy there the Archbishop of Dublin, carying along with him the curses of many, because hee being runne much in debt for victuall and divers other things, would pay little or nothing at all. About Saint <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> day, divers dyed in Normandy, as Fryer <hi>Thomas Butler,</hi> that was Prior of Kilmainan, and many others. Whom Fryer <hi>Iohn Fitz Henry</hi> succeeded in the Priory. The Archbishop of Dublin, being Lord Deputy, made an assault upon Scohies, and slue thirtie of the Irish, neere unto Rodiston. Also the thirteenth of February, <hi>Iohn Fitz Henry,</hi> Prior of Kilmainan departed this life; and <hi>William Fitz Thomas</hi> was chosen to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in his place, &amp; was confirmed the morrow after Saint <hi>Velentines</hi> day. Also the morrow after the Lord <hi>Iohn Talbot</hi> Lord <hi>Furnivall</hi> delivered up his place into the hands of the Lord <hi>Richard Talbot</hi> Archbishop of Dublin, who was afterward chosen to be Lord Iustice of Ireland.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1420. about the fourth des of Aprill, <hi>Iames Butler,</hi> Earle of Ormond, Lord Lievetenant of Ireland, landed at Waterford, and shortly after he caused a combat to be fought betwixt two of his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins: of whom one was slaine in the place, and the other was carried away sore wounded unto Kilkenny.</p>
                  <p>On Saint <hi>Georges</hi> day, the same Lord Lievetenant held a Councell at Dublin, and there summoned a Parliament, and after the midst thereof, he made great preyes upon <hi>O Rely Mac Mahon, Mac Gynoys.</hi>
                     <pb n="222" facs="tcp:18659:190"/>
And the seventh of Iune, the Parliament began at Dublin, and there were granted to the Lord Lievetenant, seaven hundred markes. And that Parliament continued for sixteene dayes, and was adjourned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to Dublin untill Munday after Saint <hi>Andrewes</hi> day. And in the said Parliament were reckoned up the debts of the Lord <hi>Iohn Talbot,</hi> late Lord Lievetenant, which amounted to a great summe. Also on the morrow after Michaelmas day, <hi>Michael Bodley</hi> departed this life. Vpon Saint <hi>Francis</hi> Eeve, dyed Fryer <hi>Nicholas Talbot,</hi> Abbot of the Monastery of Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> the Martyr at Dublin, whom Fryer <hi>Iohn Whiting</hi> succeeded. The morrow after the feast day of the Apostles <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Iude,</hi> the Castle of Colmolin was taken by <hi>Thomas Fitz Girald.</hi> And on Saint <hi>Katherines</hi> Eeven, <hi>Buttler,</hi> Sonne and heire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Earle of Ormond, was borne: and the Munday after Saint <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes</hi> day, the Parliament was begun at Dublin, and continued for thirteene dayes; and there were granted unto the Lord Lievetenant, three hundred markes, and then againe the Parliament was adjour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned untill Munday after Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> day. Then rumours were spread abroad, that the Lord <hi>Thomas Fitz Iohn,</hi> Earle of Desmond, was departed this life at Paris, upon Saint <hi>Laurence</hi> day, and that he was buried in the Covent of the Fryers Preachers there, the King of England being there present. After whom succeeded his Vncle <hi>Iames Fitz Girald,</hi> whom he had three severall times renounced, alledging that he was an unthrift, and had wasted his Patrimony both in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and England, and that hee gave or would give lands unto the Monastery of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> of Keynisham.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1421. Our Lady day fell out to be upon Munday in Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster weeke. Also the Parliament began the third time at Dublin, the Munday after Saint <hi>Ambroses</hi> day; and there it was ordained that agents should be sent over unto the King for reformation of matters touching the state of the land; namely, the Archbishop of Armagh, and Sir <hi>Christopher Preston,</hi> Knight. At the same time <hi>Richard Ottdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> Bishop of Casshell, was accused of <hi>Iohn Gese,</hi> Bishop of Lismore and Waterford, upon thirty articles: among other, one was, that he made very much of the Irish, and that he loved none of the English nation, and that he bestowed no Benefice upon any English man, and that he counselled other Bishops not to give the least Benefice to any of them: that he counterfeited the Kings Seale and letters Patents: that he went about to make himselfe King of Munster: and that hee had taken a Ring from the image of Saint <hi>Patricke,</hi> (which the Earle of Desmond had offered) and bestowed it upon his Concubine And he exhibited many other enormious matters against him in writing, by whom the Lords and Commons were troubled. Also in the same Parliament, there arose a contention betwixt <hi>Adam Payn,</hi> Bishop of Clone, because the said <hi>Adam</hi> would have united unto his See, the Church of another Prelate, and the other would not give way unto
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:18659:191"/>
it; and so they were dismissed unto the Court of Rome, &amp; the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment continued eighteene dayes. Then newes were stirring, that the Lord <hi>Thomas</hi> of Lancaster, Duke of Clarence, was slaine in France, and many other with him. Vpon the seventh of May there was slaughter made upon the Earle of Ormonds, the Lord Lievetenants men, by Omordris, neere unto the Monastery of Leys, and there were seaven and twenty English men slaine: the chiefe whereof were <hi>Purcell</hi> and <hi>Grant,</hi> tenne Noble men were taken prisoners, and two hundred fled unto the said Abbey, and so saved themselves. About the Ides of May, dyed Sir <hi>Iohn Bedloe,</hi> knight, and <hi>Ieffery Galon,</hi> sometime Maior of Dublin, who was buried in the house of the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Preachers of the same City. About the same time, <hi>Mac Mahon</hi> an Irish Lord, did much hurt in Vrgile, by wasting and burning all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. Vpon the seaventh of Iune, the Lord Lievetenant entred into the Country, about Leys, upon Omordris, leading a very great army, and for the space of foure dayes together, slaying the people, till the Irish were glad to sue for peace. On the feast of Saint <hi>Michael</hi> the Arch-angell, <hi>Thomas Stanley,</hi> with all the Knights and Esquires of Meath and Irel, tooke <hi>Neyle O Donnell</hi> prisoner, and slue the rest, in the fourteenth yeere of the raigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt.</p>

blame thereof unto the Heavens, so to excuse their owne follies and imperfections. So have I heard it often wished also, (even of some whose great wisedomes in opinion should seeme to judge more soundly of so weighty a consideration) that all that land were a Sea poole: which kinde of speech, is the manner rather of desperate men farre driven, to wish the utter ruine of that which they cannot redress, then of grave Councellors, which ought to thinke nothing so hard but that thorough wisedome, it may bee mastered and subdued, since the <hi>Poet</hi> saith, that <hi>the wiseman shall rule even over the Starres,</hi> much more over the Earth, for were it not the part of a desperate Phisitian to wish his diseased Patient dead, rather then to apply the best indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his skill, for his recovery. But since we are so farre entred, let us, I pray you, a little devise of those evils, by which that country is held in this wretched case, that it cannot (as you say) be recured.

                     <p>Surely <hi>Eudox.</hi> the evils which you desire to be recounted are very many, &amp; almost countable with those which were hidden in the basket of <hi>Pandora.</hi> But since you please I will out of that infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, reckon but some that are most capitall, &amp; commonly occurrant both in the life &amp; conditions of private men, as also in the managing of publicke affaires and pollicy, the which you shall understand to be of divers natures, as I observed them: For some of them are of verie great antiquity and continuance; others more late and of lesse indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; others dayly growing and increasing continuallie by their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill occasions, which are every day offered.</p>

                     <p>Tell them then, I pray you, in the same order that you haue now rehearsed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for there can be no better method then this which the very matter it selfe offereth. And when you have reckoned all the evils, let us heare your opinion for the redressing of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: After which there will perhaps of it selfe appeare some reasonable way to settle a sound and perfect rule of government, by shunning the former evils, and following the offered good. The which method we may learne of the wise Phisitians, which first require that the malady be knowne throughly, and discovered: Afterwards to teach how to cure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse it: And lastly doe prescribe a dyet with straight rule and orders to be dayly observed, for feare of relapse into the former disease, or falling into some other more dangerous then it.</p>

                     <p>I will then according to your advisement begin to declare the evils, which seeme to me, most hurtfull to the common-weale of that land; And first those (I say) which were most auncient and long growne. And they also are of three sorts: The first in the Lawes, the second in Customes, and the last in Religion.</p>

                     <p>Why <hi>Irenaus</hi> can there be any evill in the lawes, can things which are ordained for the good and safety of all, turne to the evill and hurt of them? This well I wore both in that State, and in all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:18659:198"/>
other, that were they not contained in duty with feare of law, which restraineth offences, and inflicteth sharpe punishment to misdoers, no man should enjoy any thing; every mans hand would be against an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Therfore in finding fault with the Lawes, I doubt me, you shall much over-shoote your selfe, and make me the more dislike your o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dislikes of that government.</p>

                     <p>The Lawes <hi>Eudox.</hi> I doe not blame for themselves, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing right well that all Lawes are ordained for the good of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weale, and for repressing of licentiousnesse and vice, but it fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth out in Lawes, no otherwise then it doth in Physick, which was at first devised, and is yet daylie ment, and ministred for the health of the Patient. But neverthelesse we often see, that either thorough ignorance of the disease, or thorough unseasonablenesse of the time, or other accidents comming betweene, in stead of good, it worketh hurt, and out of one evill, throweth the Patient into many miseries. So the Lawes were at first intended for the reformation of abuses, and peaceable continuance of the Subiect; but are sithence ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther disanulled, or quite prevaricated thorough change and alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of times, yet are they good still in themselves, but in that commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-wealth which is ruled by them, they worke not that good which they should, and sometimes also that evill which they would not.</p>

                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>Whether doe you meane this by the Common-Lawes of that Realme, or by the Statute Lawes, and Acts of Parliaments.</p>

                     <p>Surely by them both: for even the Common law being that which <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Normandy</hi> brought in with his conquest, and laid u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the neck of <hi>England,</hi> though perhaps it fitted well with the state of <hi>England</hi> then being, and was readily obeyed thorough the power of the Commander, which had before subdued the people unto him, &amp; made easie way to the setling of his will, yet with the state of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> peradventure it doth not so well agree, being a people very stubborne and untamed, or if it were ever tamed, yet now lately having quite shooken off their yoake, &amp; broken the bonds of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. For <hi>England</hi> (before the entrance of the Conqueror) was a peaceable Kingdome, and but lately inured to the milde and goodly government of <hi>Edward</hi> surnamed the Confessor, besides now lately growne into a loathing and detestation of the unjust and tyrannous rule of <hi>Harold</hi> an usurper, which made them the more willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of any reasonable conditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; order of the new victor, thinking surely that it could be no worse then the latter, and hoping well it would be as good as the former, yet what the proofe of first bringing in &amp; establishing of those lawes was, was to many full bitterly made knowne. But with <hi>Ireland</hi> it is farre otherwise, for it is a Nation ever acquainted with warres, though but amongst themselves, &amp; in their owne kinde of military discipline, trayned up ever from their youthes, which they have never yet beene taught to lay aside, nor made to learne obedience unto Lawes, scarcely to know the name of Law, but in stead thereof have alwayes preserved and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:18659:199"/>
kept their owne Law, which is the <hi>Brehon</hi> Law.</p>

                     <p>What is that which you call the <hi>Brehon</hi> law, it is a word unto us altogether unknowne?</p>

                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>It is a rule of right unwritten, but delivered by tradition from one to another, in which oftentimes there appeareth great shew of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, in determining the right betweene party and party, but in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things repugning quite both to Gods Law, and mans: As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in the case of murder, the <hi>Brehon,</hi> that is their judge, will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound betweene the murderer, and the friends of the party murdered which prosecute the action, that the malefactor shall give unto them, or to the child, or wife of him that is slain, a recompence, which they call an <hi>Eriach</hi>: By which vilde law of theirs, many murders amongst them are made up, and smothered. And this Iudge being as hee is called the Lords <hi>Brehon,</hi> adjudgeth for the most part, a better share unto his Lord, that is the Lord of the soyle, or the head of that Sept, and also unto himselfe for his judgement a greater portion, then unto the Plantiffes or parties greived.</p>

                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>This is a most wicked law indeed: But I trust it is not now used in Ireland, since the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have had the absolute do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion thereof, and established their owne Lawes there.</p>

                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes truly, for there be many wide countries in <hi>Ireland</hi> which the lawes of <hi>England</hi> were never established in, nor any acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of subjection made, &amp; also even in those which are subdued; &amp; seeme to acknowledge subjection, yet the same <hi>Brehon</hi> law is practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed among themselues, by reason, that dwelling as they doe, whole nations and septs of the Irish together, without any Englishman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, they may doe what they list, and compound or altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conceale amongst themselves their owne crimes, of which no notice can be had, by them which would and might amend the same, by the rule of the Lawes of <hi>England.</hi>

                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>What is this which you say? And is there any part of that Realme or any Nation therein, which have not yet beene subdued to the Crowne of <hi>England</hi>? Did not the whole Realme universally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and acknowledge our late Prince of famous memory <hi>Henry</hi> the Viii<hi rend="sup">th</hi> for their onely King and Leige Lord?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes verily: in a Parliament holden in the time of Sir <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Saint-Leger</hi> then Lord Deputy, all the Irish Lords and principall men came in, and being by faire meanes wrought thereunto, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged King <hi>Henry</hi> for their Soveraigne Lord, reserving yet (as some say) unto themselves all their owne former priviledges and Seignories inviolate.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>Then by that acceptance of his Soveraignty they also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of his lawes. Why then should any other lawes be now used amongst them?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>True it is that thereby they bound themselves to his lawes &amp; obedience, and in case it had beene followed upon them, as it should have beene, and a government thereupon setled among them
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18659:199"/>
agreeable thereunto, they should have beene reduced to perpetuall civilitie, and contained in continuall dutie. But what bootes it to breake a Colte, and to let him straight runne loose at randome. So were these people at first well handled, and wisely brought to acknowledge allegiance to the Kings of England: but being straight left unto themselves and their owne inordinate life and manners, they eftsoones forgot what before they were taught, and so soone as they were out of sight, by themselves shooke off their bridles, and beganne to colte anew, more licentiously then before.</p>

                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>It is a great pittie, that so good an oportunity was omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and so happie an occasion fore-slacked, that might have beene the eternall good of the Land. But doe they not still acknowledge that submission?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>No, they doe not: for now the heires and posterity of them which yeelded the same, are (as they say) either ignorant thereof, or doe wilfully deny, or stedfastly disavow it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>How can they so doe justly? Doth not the act of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in any lawfull graunt or conveyance, bind their heires for ever thereunto? Sith then the Auncestors of those that now live, yeelded themselves then subjects and Liegemen, shall it not tye their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to the same subiection?</p>

                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>They say no: for their Auncestours had no estate in any their Lands, Seigniories, or Hereditaments, longer then during their own lifes, as they alledge, for all the Irish doe hold their Land by <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistrie</hi>; which is (say they) no more but a personall estate for his life time, that is, <hi>Tanist,</hi> by reason that he is admitted thereunto by ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Countrey.</p>

                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>What is this which you call <hi>Tanist</hi> and <hi>Tanistry?</hi> They be names and termes never heard of nor knowne to us.</p>

                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>It is a custome amongst all the Irish, that presently after the death of any of their chiefe Lords or Captaines, they doe presently assemble themselves to a place generally appointed &amp; knowne unto them to choose another in his steed, where they doe nominate and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect for the most part, not the eldest sonne, nor any of the children of the Lord deceased, but the next to him of blood, that is the eldest &amp; worthiest, as commonly the next brother unto him if he have any, or the next cousin, or so forth, as any is elder in that kinred or sept, and then next to him doe they choose the next of the blood to be <hi>Tanist,</hi> who shall next succeed him in the said Captainry, if he live therunto.</p>

                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>Doe they not use any ceremony in this election? for all barbarous nations are commonly great observers of ceremonies and superstitious rites.</p>

                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>They vse to place him that shalbe their Captaine, upon a stone alwayes reserved for that purpose, &amp; placed commonly upon a hill. In some of which I have seen formed &amp; ingraven a foot, which they say was the measure of their first Captaines foot, whereon hee standing, receive an oath to preserve all the auncient former cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18659:200"/>
of the Countrey inviolable, and to deliver up the succession peaceably to his <hi>Tanist,</hi> and then hath a wand delivered unto him by some whose proper office that is: after which, descending from the stone, he turneth himselfe round, thrice forward, &amp; thrice backward.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>But how is the <hi>Tanist</hi> chosen?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>They say he setteth but one foot upon the stone, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth the like oath that the Captaine did.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>Have you ever heard what was the occasion and first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this custome? for it is good to know the same, and may perhaps discover some secret meaning and intent therein, very mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall to the state of that government.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>I have heard that the beginning &amp; cause of this ordinance amongst the Irish, was specially for the defence and maintenance of their Lands in their posteritie, and for excluding all innovation or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienation thereof unto strangers, and specially to the English. For when their Captaine dieth, if the Signiorie should descend to his child, &amp; he perhaps an Infant, another peradventure step in between, or thrust him out by strong hand, being then unable to defend his right, or to withstand the force of a forreiner, and therfore they doe appoint the eldest of the kinne to have the Signiorie, for that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly is a man of stronger yeares, and better experience to maintain the inheritance, and to defend the Countrey, either against the next bordering Lords, which use commonly to incroach one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as each one is stronger, or against the English, which they thinke lye still in waite to wype them out of their Lands and Territoryes. And to this end the <hi>Tanist</hi> is alwayes ready knowne, if it should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the Captaine suddenly to dye, or to be slaine in battell, or to be out of the Countrey, to defend and keepe it from all such doubts and dangers. For which cause the <hi>Tanist</hi> hath also a share of the Country allotted unto him, and certaine cuttings and spendings upon all the inhabitants under the Lord.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>When I heard this word <hi>Tanist,</hi> it bringeth to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance what I have read of <hi>Tania,</hi> that it should signifie a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince or Seigniorie, as <hi>Aquitania, Lusitania,</hi> and <hi>Britania,</hi> the which some thinke to be derived of <hi>Dania,</hi> that is, from the <hi>Danes,</hi> but, I thinke, amisse. But sure it seemeth, that it came anciently from those barbarous nations that over-ranne the world, which possessed those Dominions, whereof they are now so called. And so it may well be that from thence the first originall of this word <hi>Tanist</hi> and <hi>Tani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry</hi> came, and the custome thereof hath sithence, as many others els, beene continued, But to that generall subjection of the Land, whereof wee formerly spake, me seemes that this custome or tenure can be no barre nor impeachment, seeing that in open Parliament by their said acknowledgment they waved the benefite thereof, and submitted themselves to the benefite of their new Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>Yea but they say as I earst tolde you, that they reserved
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18659:200"/>
their titles, tenures and Seigniories whole and sound to themselves, and for proofe alledge, that they have ever sithence remained to them untouched, so as now to alter them, should (say they) be a great wrong.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>What remedie is there then, or meanes to avoide this inconvenience? for without first cutting of this dangerous custome, it seemeth hard to plant any sound ordenance, or reduce them to a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill government, since all their ill customes are permitted unto them.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>Surely nothing hard: for by this Act of Parliament where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee speake, nothing was given to K. <hi>Henry</hi> which he had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from his Auncestors, but onely the bare name of a King, for all other absolute power of principality he had in himselfe before deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from many former Kings, his famous Progenitours and worthy Conquerors of that Land. The which sithence they first conquered and by force subdued unto them, what needed afterwards to enter into any such idle termes with them to be called their King, when it is in the power of the Conqueror to take upon himself what title he will, over his Dominions conquered. For all is the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, as <hi>Tully</hi> to <hi>Brutus</hi> faith. Therefore (me seemes) instead of so great and meritorious a service as they boast they performed to the King, in bringing all the Irish to acknowledge him for their Liege, they did great hurt unto his Title, and have left a perpetuall gall in the minde of the people, who before being absolutely bound to his obedience, are now tyed but with termes, whereas else both their lives, their lands, and their liberties were in his free power to appoint what tenures, what lawes, what conditions hee would over them, which were all his: against which there could be no rightfull resistance, or if there were, he might when he would establish them with a stronger hand.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>Yea but perhaps it seemed better unto that noble King to bring them by their owne accord to his obedience, and to plant a peaceable government amongst them, then by such violent means to pluck them under. Neither yet hath he therby lost any thing that he formerly had, for having all before absolutely in his owne power, it remaineth so still unto him, he having thereby neither forgiven, nor forgone any thing thereby unto them, but having received somthing from them, that is a more voluntary and loyall subjection. So as her Majesty may yet when it shall please her, alter any thing of those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ordinances, or appoint other lawes, that may be more both for her owne behoofe, and for the good of that people.</p>

                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18659:201"/>
unjust and also more inconvenient for the common people, as by your late relation of them I have gathered. As for the lawes of England they are surely most just and most agreeable, both with the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and with the nature of the people. How falls it then that you seeme to dislike of them, as not so meete for that Realme of Ireland, and not onely the Common Law, but also the Statutes and Actes of Parliament, which were specially provided and intended for the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie benefit thereof?</p>

                     <p>I was about to have told you my reason therein, but that your selfe drewe me away with other questions, for I was shewing you by what meanes, and by what sort, the Positive Lawes, were first brought in and established by the <hi>Norman Conquerour:</hi> which were not by him devised nor applyed unto the state of the Realme then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor as yet might best be (as should by Lawgivers principally be regarded) but were indeed the very Lawes of his owne Countrey of <hi>Normandie.</hi> The condition whereof, how farre it differeth from this of <hi>England,</hi> is apparant to every least judgement. But to transferre the same lawes for the governing of the Realme of <hi>Ireland,</hi> was much more inconvenient and unmeete, for he found a better advantage of the time, then was in the planting of them in Ireland, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed th'execution of them with more severity, and was also present in person to overlooke the Magistrates, and to over awe these subjects with the terrour of his Sword, and countenance of his Majesty. But not so in Ireland, for they were otherwise affected, and yet doe so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, so as the same Lawes (me seemes) can ill fit with their disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or worke that reformation that is wished. For Lawes ought to be fashioned unto the manners &amp; conditions of the people, to whom they are meant, and not to be imposed upon them according to the simple rule of right, for then (as I said) in stead of good they may worke ill, and pervert Iustice to extreame injustice. For hee that transferres the Lawes of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to the people of <hi>Athens,</hi> should finde a great absurditie and inconvenience. For those Lawes of <hi>Lacedemon</hi> were devised by <hi>Licurgus</hi> as most proper and best agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with that people, whom hee knew to be enclined altogether to warres, and therefore wholly trained them up even from their Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles in armes and military exercises, cleane contrary to the instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Solon,</hi> who in his Lawes to the <hi>Athenians</hi> laboured by all meanes to temper their warlike courages with sweet delightes of learning and sciences, so that asmuch as the one excelled in armes, the other exceeded in knowledge. The like regard &amp; moderation ought to be had in tempering and managing of this stubborne nation of the <hi>Irish</hi> to bring them from their delight of licentious barbarisme unto the love of goodnes and civilitie.</p>

The which whensoever they make head, no lawes, no penalties, can restraine, but that they doe in the violence of that furie, tread downe and trample under foote all both divine and humane things, and the lawes themselues they doe speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally rage at, and rend in peeces, as most repugnant to their libertie and naturall freedome, which in their madnes they affect.</p>

What oddes is there then in this case? why should not the same lawes take as good effect in that people as they did here, being in like sort prepared by the sword, and brought under by extreamity? and why should they not continue in as good force and vigour for the containing of the people?</p>

                     <p>The case yet is not like, but there appeareth great oddes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them: for by the conquest of <hi>Henry</hi> the second, true it is that the Irish were utterly vanquished and subdued, so as no enemy was able to hold up head against his power, in which their weakenes hee brought in his lawes, and settled them as now they there remaine; Like as <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour did, so as in thus much they agree; but in the rest that is the cheifest, they varie: for to whom did King <hi>Henry</hi> the second impose those lawes, not to the Irish, for the most part of them fled from his power, into deserts and mountaines, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the wyde countrey to the <hi>Conquerour</hi>: who in their stead eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soones placed English men, who possessed all their lands and did
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18659:202"/>
quite shut out the <hi>Irish,</hi> or the most part of them. And to those new inhabitants and Colonies, he gave his lawes, to wit the same lawes, under which they were borne and bred, the which it was no difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to place amongst them, being formerly well inured thereunto, unto whom afterwards they repaired diverse of the poore distressed people of the <hi>Irish,</hi> for succour and reliefe of whom, such as they thought fit for labour and industriously disposed, as the most part of their baser sort are, they received unto them as their vassalls, but scarcely vouchsafed to impart unto them the benefit of those lawes under which themselves lived, but every one made his will and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement a law unto his owne vassall: Thus was not the Law of <hi>England</hi> ever properly applyed unto the <hi>Irish</hi> Nation, as by a purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed plot of government, but as they could insinuate and steale them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves under the same, by their humble carriage and submission.</p>

                     <p>How comes it then to passe, that having beene once so low brought, and thoroughly subjected, they afterwards lifted up themselves so strongly againe, and sithence doe stand so stiffely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all rule and government?</p>

                     <p>They say that they continued in that lowlinesse, untill the time that the division between the two houses of <hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>Yorke</hi> arose for the Crowne of <hi>England:</hi> at which time all the great <hi>English</hi> Lords and Gentlemen which had great possessions in <hi>Ireland,</hi> repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red over hither into <hi>England,</hi> some to succour their Friends here, and to strengthen their partie for to obtaine the Crowne, others to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their lands and possessions here against such as hovered after the same upon hope of the alteration of the kingdome and successe of that side which they favoured and affected. Then the <hi>Irish</hi> whom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had banished into the mountaines, where they lived onely upon whitt meates, as it is recorded, seeing now their lands so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peopled, and weakened, came downe into all the plaines adjoyning, and thence expelling those few <hi>English</hi> that remained, repossessed them againe, since which they have remained in them, and growing greater, have brought under them many of the English, which were before their Lords. This was one of the occasions by which all those Countreyes, which lying neere unto any Mountaines, or <hi>Irish</hi> desarts, had beene planted with <hi>English,</hi> were shortly displanted and lost. As namely in <hi>Mounster</hi> all the lands adjoyning unto <hi>Slewlogher, Arlo,</hi> and the bog of <hi>Allon.</hi> In <hi>Connaght</hi> all the Countries bordering upon the <hi>Curlues, Mointerolis,</hi> and <hi>Orourkes</hi> Countrey. In <hi>Leinster</hi> all the lands bordering unto the Mountaines of <hi>Glanmalour,</hi> unto <hi>Shillelah,</hi> unto the <hi>Brackenah,</hi> and <hi>Polmonte.</hi> In <hi>Vlster</hi> all the Countreyes neere unto <hi>Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connel, Tyrone,</hi> and the <hi>Scottes.</hi>

                     <p>Surely this was a great violence: but yet by your speach it seemeth that onely the Countreyes and valleyes neere adjoyning unto those mountaines and desarts, were thus recovered by the <hi>Irish</hi>: but how comes it now that we see almost all that Realme reposses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of them? was there any more such evill occasions growing by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:18659:202"/>
the troubles of <hi>England.</hi> Or did the Irish out of those places so by them gotten breake further and stretch themselves out thorough the whole land: for now, for ought that I can understand, there is no part but the bare <hi>English Pale,</hi> in which the Irish have not the greatest footing.</p>

                     <p>But out of these small beginings by them gotten neare to the mountaines, did they spread themselves into the Inland, and also to their further advantage, there did other like unhappy accidents hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen out of <hi>England</hi>; which gave heart and good opportunity to them to regaine their old possessions: For in the raigne of King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, things remained yet in the same state that they were after the late breaking out of the <hi>Irish,</hi> which I spake of; and that noble Prince began to cast an Eye unto <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to minde the reformation of things there runne amisse: for he sent over his brother the worthy Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> who having married the heire of the Earle of <hi>Vlster,</hi> and by her having all the Earledome of <hi>Vlster,</hi> and much in <hi>Meath</hi> and in <hi>Mounster,</hi> very carefully went about the redressing of all those late evills, and though he could not beate out the <hi>Irish</hi> againe, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his short continuance, yet hee did shut them up within those narrow corners and glynnes under the mountaines foote, in which they lurked, and so kept them from breaking any further, by buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding strong holdes upon every border, and fortifying all passages. Amongst the which hee repaired the <hi>Castle</hi> of <hi>Clare</hi> in <hi>Thomond,</hi> of which Countrey he had the inheritance, and of <hi>Mortimers</hi> lands ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning, which is now (by the <hi>Irish</hi>) called <hi>Killaloe.</hi> But the times of that good King growing also troublesome, did lett the thorough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of all things. And thereunto soone after was added ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fatall mischeife, which wrought a greater calamity then all the former. For the said Duke of <hi>Clarence</hi> then Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> was by practise of evill persons, about the King his brother, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thence away: and soone after by sinister meanes was cleane made away. Presently after whose death, all the North revolting, did set up <hi>Oneale</hi> for their Captaine, being before that of small power and regard: and there arose in that part of <hi>Thomond,</hi> one of the <hi>O-Briens,</hi> called <hi>Murrogh en-Ranagh,</hi> that is, <hi>Morrice</hi> of the <hi>Ferne</hi> or wast wilde places, who gathering unto him all the reliques of the discontented <hi>Irish,</hi> eftsoones surprised the said Castle of <hi>Clare,</hi> burnt, and spoyled all the <hi>English</hi> there dwelling, and in short space possessed all that countrey beyond the River of <hi>Shanan</hi> and neere adjoyning: Whence shortly breaking forth like a suddaine tempest he over-ran all <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> and <hi>Connaght</hi>; breaking downe all the holds and fortresses of the <hi>English,</hi> defacing and utterly subverting all corporate Townes, that were not strongly walled: for those, he had no meanes nor Engines to overthrow, neither indeed would hee stay at all about them, but speedily ran forward, counting his suddennesse his most advantage, that he might overtake the <hi>English</hi> before they could fortifie or ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther themselves together. So in short space hee cleane wyped out
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:18659:203"/>
many great Townes, as first <hi>Inchequin,</hi> then <hi>Killalow,</hi> before called <hi>Clariford,</hi> also <hi>Thurles, Mourne, Buttevant,</hi> and many others, whose names I cannot remember, and of some of which there is now no memory nor signe remaining. Vpon report whereof there flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto him all the scumme of the <hi>Irish</hi> out of all places, that ere long he had a mighty Army, and thence marched foorth into <hi>Leinster,</hi> where he wrought great out-rages, wasting all the Countrey where he went; for it was his policie to leave no hold behinde him, but to make all plaine and waste. In the which he soone after created him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe King, and was called King of all <hi>Ireland,</hi> which before him I doe not reade that any did so generally, but onely <hi>Edward le Bruce.</hi>

the woods and mountaines, in which they long had lurked, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched foorth into the <hi>English</hi> pale, which then was chiefly in the North from the point of <hi>Donluce</hi> and beyond unto <hi>Dublin</hi>: Having in the middest of her <hi>Knockfergus, Belfast, Armagh,</hi> and <hi>Carling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> which are now the most out-bounds and abandoned places in the <hi>English</hi> Pale, and indeede not counted of the <hi>English</hi> Pale at all: for it stretcheth now no further then <hi>Dundalke</hi> towardes the North.

And yet the rebellion of <hi>Thomas fitz Garret</hi> did well-nye stretch it selfe into all parts of <hi>Ireland.</hi> But that which was in the time of the government of the Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> was sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no lesse generall then all those, for there was no part free from the contagion, but all conspired in one, to cast off their subiection to the Crowne of <hi>England.</hi> Neverthelesse thorough the most wise and vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant handling of that right noble Lord, it got not the head which the former evills found; for in them the Realme was left like a ship in a storme, amidst all the raging surges, unruled, and undirected of any: for they to whom she was committed, either fainted in their labour, or forsooke their charge. But hee (like a most wise Pilote,) kept her course carefully, and held her most strongly even against those roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring billowes, that he safely brought her out of all; so as long after, even by the space of 12. or 13. whole yeares, she roade at peace, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough his onely paines and excellent indurance, how ever envy list to blatter against him. But of this wee shall have more occasion to speake in another place. Now (if you please) let us returne againe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our first course.</p>

                     <p>Truely I am very glad to heare your iudgement of the government of that honorable man so soundly, for I have heard it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes maligned, and his doings depraved of some, who (I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) did rather of malicious minde, or private grievance, seeke to detract from the honour of his deeds and Counsels, then of any iust cause, but hee was neverthelesse in the iudgements of all good and wise men, defended and maintained. And now that hee is dead, his immortall fame surviveth, and flourisheth in the mouthes of all people, that even those which did backbite him, are checked with their owne venome, and breake their galls to heare his so honorable report. But let him rest in peace, and turne we to our more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some matters of discourse, of which I am right sorry that you make so short an end, and covet to passe over to your former purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, for there be many other parts of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which I have heard have bin no lesse vexed with the like stormes, then these which you have treated of, as the Countries of the <hi>Birnes</hi> &amp; <hi>Tooles</hi> neere <hi>Dublin,</hi>

                     <p>All this which you have named, and many more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, often times have I right well knowne, and yet often doe kindle great fires of tumultuous broyles in the Countreyes borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring upon them. All which to rehearse, should rather bee to Chronicle times, then to search into reformation of abuses in that Realme, and yet very needfull it will bee to consider them, and the evills which they have often stirred up, that some redresse thereof, and prevention of the evills to come, may thereby ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be devised. But I suppose wee shall have a fitter opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the same, when wee shall speake of the particular ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uses, and enormities of the government, which will bee next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter these generall defects and inconveniences which I saide were in the Lawes, Customes, and Religion.</p>

                     <p>Goe to them a Gods name, and follow the course which you have promised to your selfe, for it fitteth best, I must confesse with the purpose of our discourse. Declare your opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as you began about the Lawes of the Realme, what incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie you have conceived to bee in them, chiefly in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, which I would have thought most free from all such dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</p>

                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>The Common Law is (as I saide before) of it selfe most rightfull and very convenient (I suppose) for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, for which it was first devised: for this (I thinke) as it seeemes reasonable, that out of your manners of your people, and abuses of your Countrey, for which they were invented, they take their first beginning, or else they should bee most unjust; for no Lawes of man (according to the straight rule of right) are just, but as in regard of the evills which they prevent, and the safety of the Common-weale which they provide for. As for example, in your true ballancing of Iustice, it is a flat wrong to punish the thought or purpose of any before it bee enacted, for true Iustice punisheth nothing but the evill act or wicked word, that by the Lawes of all Kingdomes it is a capitall cryme to devise or purpose the death of your King: The reason is, for that when such a purpose is effected, it should then bee too late to devise thereof, and should turne the Common-wealth to more losse by the death of their Prince, then such punishment of the malefactors. And therefore the Law in that case punisheth the thought, for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is a mischiefe, then an inconvenience. So that <hi>Ius politicum,</hi>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:18659:205"/>
though it bee not of it selfe just, yet by application, or rather necessity it is made just, and this onely respect maketh all Lawes just. Now then, if these Lawes of <hi>Ireland</hi> bee not likewise applyed and fitted for that Realme, they are sure very inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>You reason strongly: but what unfitnesse doe you finde in them for that Realme, shew us some particulars.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>The Common Law appointeth, that all tryalls, as well of Crimes, as Titles and Rights, shall bee made by verdict of a Iury, chosen out of the honest and most substantiall Free-holders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now, most of the Free-holders of that Realme, are <hi>Irish,</hi> which when the cause shall fall betwixt an Englishman and an Irish, or betweene the Queene, and any Free-houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of that Countrey, they make no more scruple to passe against an Englishman, and the Queene, though it bee to strayne their oathes, then to drinke milke unstrayned. So that before the Iury goe together, it is all to nothing what the verdict shall be. The tryall have I so often seene, that I dare confidently avouch the abuse thereof. Yet is the Law of it selfe, (as I said) good, and the first institution thereof being given to all Englishmen ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rightfully, but now that the Irish have stepped into the very roomes of your English, wee are now to become heedfull and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident in Iuryes.</p>

                     <p>In sooth <hi>Iren.</hi> you have discoversed a point worthy the consideration; for heereby not onely the English subject findeth no indifferencie in deciding of his cause, bee it never so just; but the Queene aswell in all pleas of the Crowne, as also in inquiries for Escheates, Lands attainted, Wardshipps, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealements, and all such like, is abused and exceedingly dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>You say very true; for I dare undertake, that at this day there are more attainted Lands, concealed from her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, then shee hath now possessions in all <hi>Ireland,</hi> and it is no small inconvenience: for besides that, shee looseth so much Land as should turne to her great profite, shee besides loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth so many good subjects, which might bee assured unto her, as those Landes would yeelde Inhabitants and living unto.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>But doth many of that people (say you) make no more conscience to perjure themselves in their verdicts, and damne their soules?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>Not onely so in their verdicts, but also in all other their dealings: especially with the English they are most will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully bent: for though they will not seeme manifestly to doe it, yet will some one or other subtle-headed fellow amongst them, put some quirke, or devise some evasion, whereof the rest will likely take hold, and suffer themselves easily to be led by him to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18659:205"/>
that themselves desired. For in the most apparant matter that may bee, the least question or doubt that may bee mooved, will make a stoppe unto them, and put them quite out of the way. Besides, that of themselves (for the most part) they are so cautelous and wylie-headed, especially being men of so small ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and practice in law matters, that you would wonder whence they borrow such subtiltyes and slye shifts.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>But mee thinkes this inconvenience might bee much helped in the Iudges and chiefe Magistrates which have the choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and nominating of those Iurors, if they would have dared to appoint either most Englishmen, and such Irishmen as were of the soundest judgment and disposition; for no doubt but some there bee incorruptible.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>Some there bee indeede as you say, but then would the <hi>Irish</hi> partie crye out of partialitie, and complaine hee hath no Iustice, hee is not used as a subject, hee is not suffered to have the free benefite of the Law, and these out-cryes the Magistrates there doe much shunne, as they have cause, since they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily hearkened unto heere, neither can it bee indeede, although the <hi>Irish</hi> party would bee so contented to be so compassed, that such <hi>English</hi> free-houlders which are but few, and such faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Irish-men,</hi> which are indeede as few, shall alwayes bee cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen for tryalls, for being so few, they should bee made weary of their free-houldes. And therefore a good care is to bee had by all good occasions, to encrease their number, and to plant more by them. But were it so, that the Iurors could bee pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of such choyce men as you desire, this would neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse bee as bad a corruption in the tryall, for the evidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought in by the baser <hi>Irish</hi> people, will bee as deceiptfull as the verdict, for they care much lesse then the others, what they sweare, and sure their Lordes may compell them to say any thing, for I my selfe have heard, when one of the baser sort (which they call Churles) being challenged and reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for his false oath, hath answered confidently, that his Lord commaunded him, and it was the least thing that hee could doe for his Lord, to sweare for him; so inconscionable are these common people, and so little feeling have they of God, or their owne soules good.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>It is a most miserable case, but what helpe can there then bee in this? for though the manner of the tryalls should bee altered, yet the proofe of every thing must needes bee by the testimony of such persons as the partyes shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, which if they shall bee corrupt, how can there ever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny light of the truth appeare, what remedy is there for this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, but to make heavy Lawes and Penalties against Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>

                     <p>I thinke sure that will doe small good, for when a people be inclined to any vice, or have no touch of Conscience, nor sence of their evill doings; it is bootelesse to thinke to restraine them by any penalties or feare of punishment, but either the occasion is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, or a more understanding of the right, and shame of the fault to be imprinted. For if that <hi>Licurgus</hi> should have made it death for the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> to steale, they being a people which naturally delighted in stealth, or if it should bee made a capitall crime, for the <hi>Flemmings</hi> to be taken in drunkennesse, there should have beene few <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> then left, and few <hi>Flemmings</hi> now. So unpossible it is, to remove any fault so generall in a people, with terrour of lawes or most sharpe restraints.</p>

                     <p>We are not yet come to the point to devise remedies for the evils, but only have now to recount them, of the which, this which I have told you is one defect in the Common Law.</p>

                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>Tell us then (I pray you) further, have you any more of this sort in the Common Law?</p>

                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>By rehearsall of this, I remember also of an other like, which I have often observed in trialls, to have wrought great hurt and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance, and that is the exceptions which the common law alloweth a Fellon in his tryall, for he may have (as you know) 56. exceptions pere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptory against the Iurors, of which he shal shew no cause. By w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> shift there being (as I have shewed you) so small store of honest Iury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, he will either put off his tryall, or drive it to such men as (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps) are not of the soundest sort, by whose meanes, if he can acquite himselfe of the crime, as he is likely, then will he plague such as were brought first to bee of his Iurie, and all such as made any party a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. And when he comes forth, he will make their Cowes and Garrons to walke, if he doe no other harme to their persons.</p>

                     <p>This is a slye devise, but I thinke might soone bee reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died, but we must leave it a while to the rest. In the meane-while doe you goe forwards with others.</p>

                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>There is an other no lesse inconvenience then this, which is, the tryall of accessaries to fellony, for by the common Law, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries cannot be proceeded against, till the principall have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his tryall. Now to the case, how it often falleth out in <hi>Ireland,</hi> that a stealth being made by a rebell, or an outlawe, the stolne goods are conveyed to some husbandman or Gentleman, which hath well to take to, and yet liveth most by the receipt of such stealthes, where they are found by the owner, and handled: whereupon the partie is perhaps apprehended and committed to Goale, or put upon sureties, till the Sessions, at which time the owner preferring a bill of Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, proveth sufficiently the stealth to have beene committed upon him, by such an Outlaw, and to have beene found in the possession of the prisoner, against whom, neverthelesse, no course of law can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:18659:206"/>
nor tryall can be had, for that the principall Theife is not to be gotten, notwithstanding that he likewise, standing perhaps indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted at once, with the Receiver, being in rebellion, or in the woods: where peradventure he is slaine before he can be gotten, and so the Receiver cleane acquitted and discharged of the crime. By which meanes the Theeves are greatly incouraged to steale, and their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers imboldened to receive their stealthes, knowing how hardly they can be brought to any tryall of Law.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>Truely this is a great inconvenience, and a great cause (as you say) of the maintenance of Theeves, knowing their Receivers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ready, for were there no receivers, there would be no theeves: but this (me seemes) might easily be provided for, by some act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that the receiver being convicted by good proofes might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his tryall without the principall.</p>

                     <p>You say very true <hi>Eudox.</hi> but that is almost impossible to be compassed: And herein also you discover another imperfection, in the course of the Common Law, and first ordinance of the Realme: for you know that the said Parliament must consist of the Peeres, Gentlemen, Free-holders, and Burgesses of that Realme it selfe. Now these being perhaps themselves, or the most part of them (as may seeme by their stiffe with-standing of this Act) culpable of this crime, or favourers of their freinds, which are such, by whom their Kitchins are sometimes amended, will not suffer any such Statute to passe. Yet hath it oftentimes beene attempted, and in the time of Sir <hi>Iohn Parrot</hi> very earnestly (I remember) laboured, but could by no meanes be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. And not onely this, but many other like, which are as neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the reformation of that Realme.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>This also is surely a great defect, but wee may not talke (you say) of the redressing of this, untill our second part come, which is purposely appointed thereunto. Therefore proceed to the recoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of more such evils, if at least, you have any more.</p>

                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>There is also a great inconvenience, which hath wrought great dammage, both to her Majesty, and to that common wealth, thorough close and colourable conveyances of the lands and goods of Traytors, Fellons and Fugitives. As when one of them mindeth to goe into rebellion, hee will convey away all his lands and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, to Feoffees in trust, wherby he reserveth to himselfe, but a state for terme of life, which being determined either by the sword or by the halter, their lands straight commeth to their heire, and the Queen is defrauded of the intent of the Law, which laide that grievous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment upon Traytors, to forfeite all their lands to the Prince, to the end that men might the rather be terrified from committing trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, for many which would little esteeme of their owne lives, yet for remorse of their wives and children would bee with-held from that haynous crime. This appeared plainely in the late <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond.</hi> For before his breaking forth into open Rebellion, hee had conveyed secretly all his lands to Feoffees of trust, in hope to have
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:18659:207"/>
cut off her Maiestie from the escheate of his Lands.</p>

                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>Yea, but that was well enough avoided, for the Act of Parliament which gave all his lands to the Queene, did (as I have heard) cut off and frustrate all such conveyances, as had at any time by the space of twelve yeares before his rebellion, beene made, within the compasse whereof, the fraudulent Feoffement, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the like of others his accomplices and fellow-traytors were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>Very true, but how hardly that Act of Parliament was wrought out of them, I can witnesse; and were it to be passed againe, I dare undertake it would never be compassed. But were it also that such Acts might be easily brought to passe against Traytors and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons, yet were it not an endlesse trouble, that no Traitour or Fellon should be attainted, but a Parliament must be called for bringing of his Lands to the Queene, which the Common-Law giveth her.</p>

                     <p>Yes, very greatly, for you shall understand that there bee many ill disposed and undutifull persons of that Realme, like as in this point there are also in this Realme of <hi>England</hi> too many, which being men of good inheritance, are for dislike of Religion, or danger of the law, into which they are run, or discontent of the present go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, fled beyond the seas, where they live under Princes, which are her M<hi rend="sup">ties</hi> professed enemies, &amp; converse, &amp; are confederat with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther traitors &amp; fugitives, which are there abiding. The which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse have the benefits &amp; profits of their lands here, by pretence of such colourable conveyances thereof, formerly made by them unto their privie Friends heere in trust, who privily doe send over unto them the said Revenues wherwith they are there maintained and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled against her Majestie.</p>

                     <p>I doe not thinke that there be any such fugitives, which are relieved by the profite of their Lands in <hi>England,</hi> for there is a straighter order taken.

                     <p>It is also inconvenient in the Realme of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that the Wards and Marriages of Gentlemens children should be in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of any of those <hi>Irish</hi> Lords, as now they are, by reason that their Lands bee held by Knights service of those Lords. By which means it comes to passe that those Gentlemen being thus in the ward
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18659:207"/>
of those Lords, are not onely thereby brought up lewdly, and <hi>Irish</hi>-like, but also for ever after so bound to their services, they will runne with them into any disloyall action.</p>

                     <p>This greivance <hi>Iren.</hi> is also complained of in <hi>England,</hi> but how can it be remedied? since the service must follow the tenure of the lands, and the lands were given away by the Kings of <hi>England</hi> to those Lords, when they first conquered that Realme, and to say troth, this also would be some prejudice to the Prince in her ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipps.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>I doe not meane this by the Princes wards, but by such as fall into the hands of <hi>Irish</hi> Lords, for I could wish, and this I could enforce that all those wardships were in the Princes disposition, for then it might be hoped, that she for the universall reformation of that Realme, would take better order for bringing up those wards in good nurture, and not suffer them to come into so bad hands. And although these things bee already passed away, by her Progenitours former grants unto those said Lords; yet I could finde a way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie a great part thereof, as hereafter, when fit time serves shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. And since we are entred into speech of such graunts of former Princes, to sundry persons of this Realme of <hi>Ireland,</hi> I will mention unto you some other, of like nature to this, and of like inconvenience, by which the former Kings of <hi>England,</hi> passed unto them a great part of their prerogatives, which though then it was well intended, and perhaps well deserved of them which received the same, yet now such a gapp of mischeife lyes open thereby, that I could wish it were well stopped. Of this sort are the graunts of Counties palatines in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which though at first were granted upon good consideration when they were first conquered, for that those lands lay then as a very border to the wild <hi>Irish,</hi> subject to continuall invasion, so as it was needfull to give them great priviledges for the defence of the Inhabitants thereof: yet now that it is no more a border, nor fronti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with enemies, why should such priviledges bee any more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued?</p>

                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>I would gladly know what you call a County palatine, and whence it so called.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>It was (I suppose) first named palatine of a pale, as it were a pale and defense to their inward lands, so as it is called the <hi>English Pale,</hi> and therefore is a Palsgrave, named an Earle Palatine. Others thinke of the Latine, <hi>palare,</hi> that is to forrage or out-run, because those marchers and borderers use commonly so to doe. So as to have a county palatine is, in effect, to have a priviledge to spoyle the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies borders adjoyning. And surely so it is used at this day, as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged place of spoiles and stealthes, for the county of <hi>Tipperary,</hi> which is now the onely countie palatine in <hi>Ireland,</hi> is by abuse of some bad ones, made a receptacle to rob the rest of the Counties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, by meanes of whose priviledges none will follow their stealthes, so as it being situate in the very lap of all the land, is made
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18659:208"/>
now a border, which how inconvenient it is, let every man judge. And though that right noble man, that is the Lord of the liberty, do paine himselfe, all he may, to yeeld equall Iustice unto all, yet can there not but great abuses lurke in so inward and absolute a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the consideration whereof is to be respected carefully, for the next succession. And much like unto this graunt, there are other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges graunted unto most of the corporations there: that they shal not be bound to any other government then their owne, that they shall not be charged with garrisons, that they shall not bee travailed forth of their owne franchises, that they may buy and sell with theeves and rebels, that all amercements and fines that shal be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed upon them, shall come unto themselves. All which, though at the time of their first graunt they were tollerable, and perhaps rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, yet now, are most unreasonable and inconvenient, but all these will easily be cut off with the superiour power of her Majesties prerogative, against which her owne grants are not to be pleaded or enforced.</p>

                     <p>There is one or two Statutes which make the wrongfull di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayning of any mans goods against the forme of Common Law, to be fellony. The which Statutes seeme surely to have beene at first meant for the good of that Realme, and for restrayning of a foule a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse, which then raigned commonly amongst that people, and yet is not altogether laide aside: That when any one was indebted to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he would first demaund his debt, and if he were not payed, hee would straight goe and take a distresse of his goods or cattell, where he could finde them, to the value; which he would keepe till he were satisfied, and this the simple Churle (as they call him) doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly use to doe, yet thorough ignorance of his misdoing, or evill use, that hath long settled amongst them. But this, though it bee sure most unlawfull, yet surely (me seemes) too hard to make it death, since there is no purpose in the party to steale the others goods, or to conceale the distresse, but doth it openly, for the most part, before witnesses. And againe, the same Statutes are so slackely penned (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the later of them is so unsensibly contryved, that it scarce carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth any reason in it) that they are often and very easily wrested to the fraude of the Subject, as if one going to distrayne upon his own land or Tenement, where lawfully he may, yet if in doing therof he trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse the least point of the Common Law, hee straight committeth fellony. Or if one by any other occasion take any thing from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as Boyes use sometimes to cap one another, the same is straight fellony. This is a very hard Law.</p>

                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>Nevertheles that evill use of distrayning of another mans goods yee will not deny, but it is to be abolished and taken away.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>It is so, but not by taking away the subject withall, for that is too violent a medecine, specially this use being permitted, and made lawfull to some, and to other some death. As to most of the corporate Townes there, it is graunted by their Charter, that they may, every man by himselfe, without an Officer (for that were more tollerable) for any debt, to distraine the goods of any <hi>Irish,</hi> being found within their liberty, or but passing thorough their townes. And the first permission of this, was for that in those times when that graunt was made, the <hi>Irish</hi> were not amesnable to Law, so as it was not safety for the Townes-man to goe to him forth to demaund his debt, nor possible to draw him into Law, so that he had leave to bee his owne Bayliffe, to arrest his said debters goods, within his owne franchese. The which the <hi>Irish</hi> seeing, thought it as lawfull for them to distrayne the Townes-mans goods in the Countrey, where they found it. And so by ensample of that graunt to Townes-men, they thought it lawfull, and made it a use to distrayne on anothers goods for small debts. And to say truth, mee thinkes it hard for every tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:18659:209"/>
debt, of 2. or 3. shil: to be driven to Law, which is so farre from them sometimes to be sought, for which me thinketh it too heavy an ordinance to give death, especially to a rude man that is ignorant of law, and thinketh that a common use or graunt to other men, is a law for himselfe.</p>

                     <p>Yea, but the Iudge when it commeth before him to tryall, may easily decide this doubt, and lay open the intent of the Law, by his better discretion.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>Yea, but it is dangerous to leave the sence of the Law unto the reason or will of the Iudge, who are men and may bee miscaried by affections, and many other meanes. But the Lawes ought to bee like stony Tables, plaine, stedfast, and unmoveable. There is also such another Statute or two, which make <hi>Coigny</hi> and <hi>Livery</hi> to bee treason, no lesse inconvenient then the former, being as it is penned, how ever the first purpose thereof were expedient, for thereby now no man can goe into another mans house for lodging, nor to his owne Tennants house to take victuall by the way, notwithstanding that there is no other meanes for him to have lodging, nor horse meate, nor mans meate, there being no Innes, nor none otherwise to bee bought for money, but that he is endangered by that Statute for trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, whensoever he shall happen to fall out with his Tennant, or that his said hoste list to complaine of greivance, as oftentimes I have seene them very malitiously doe, thorough the least provocation.</p>

                     <p>I doe not well know, but by ghesse, what you doe meane by these termes of <hi>Coigny</hi> and <hi>Livery,</hi> therefore I pray you explaine them.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>I know not whether the words bee English or Irish, but I suppose them to bee rather auncient English, for the Irish men can make no derivation of them. What <hi>Livery</hi> is, wee by common use in <hi>England</hi> know well enough, namely, that it is allowance of horse-meate, as they commonly use the word in stabling, as to keepe horses at <hi>Livery,</hi> the which word, I guesse, is derived of livering or delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring forth their nightly foode: So in great houses, the <hi>livery</hi> is said to be served up for all night, that is their evenings allowance for drinke. And <hi>livery</hi> is also called, the upper weede which a serving man wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, so called (as I suppose) for that it was delivered and taken from him at pleasure: So it is apparant, that by the word <hi>Livery,</hi> is there meant horse meate, like as by the word <hi>Coigny,</hi> is understood mans meate. But whence the word is derived is hard to tell: Some say of Coine, for that they used commonly in their <hi>Coignies,</hi> not onely to take meate, but coine also: and that taking of money was speciallie meant to be prohibited by that Statute: but I thinke rather this word <hi>Coigny</hi> is derived of the Irish. The which is a common use amongst Land lords of the <hi>Irish,</hi> to have a common spending upon their Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants: for all their Tennants, being commonly but Tennants at will, they use to take of them what victuals they list: For of victuals they were wont to make small reckoning: neither in this was the Tennant
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18659:209"/>
wronged, for it was an ordinary and knowne custome, and his Lord commonly used so to covenant with him, which if at any time the tenant disliked, hee might freely depart at his pleasure. But now by this Statute, the said <hi>Irish</hi> Lord is wronged, for that hee is cut off from his customary services, of the which this was one, besides many other of the like, as <hi>Cuddy, Coshery, Bonnaght, Shrah, Sorehin,</hi> and such others: the which (I thinke) were customes at first brought in by the <hi>English</hi> upon the <hi>Irish,</hi> for they were never wont, and yet are loath to yeeld any certaine Rent, but only such spendings: for their common saying is, <hi>Spend me and defend me.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>Surely I take it as you say, that therein the <hi>Irish</hi> Lord hath wrong, since it was an auncient custome, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrary to Law, for to the willing there is no wrong done. And this right well I wot, that even heere in <hi>England,</hi> there are in many places as large customes, as that of <hi>Coignie</hi> and <hi>Livery.</hi> But I suppose by your speach, that it was the first meaning of the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, to forbid the violent taking of victualls upon other mens Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants against their wills, which surely is a great out-rage, and yet not so great (mee seemes) as that it should be made treason: for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that the nature of treason is concerning the Royall estate or Person of the Prince, or practizing with his enemies, to the derogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and danger of his Crowne and dignitie, it is hardly wrested to make this treason. But (as you earst said) <hi>Better a mischiefe then an inconvenience.</hi>

                     <p>Another Statute I remember, which having beene an auncient <hi>Irish</hi> Custome, is now upon advisement made a Law, and that is called the Custome of <hi>Kin-cogish,</hi> which is, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very head of every Sept, and every chiefe of every kinred or family, should bee answerable and bound to bring foorth every one of that sept and kinred under it, at all times to be iustified, when hee should be required or charged with any treason, felony, or other haynous crime.</p>

                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>Why? surely this seemes a very necessary Law. For considering that many of them bee such Losells and scatterlings, as that they cannot easily by any Sheriffe, Constable, Bayliffe, or other ordinary Officer bee gotten, when they are challenged for any such fact, this is a very good meanes to get them to bee brought in by him, that is the head of that sept, or chiefe of that house, wherfore I wonder what just exception you can make against the same.</p>

                     <p>Truely <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> in the pretence of the good of this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, you have nothing erred, for it seemeth very expedient and necessary, but the hurt which commeth thereby is greater then the good. For whilest every chiefe of a sept standeth so bound to the Law, for every man of his blood or sept that is under him, and hee made great, by the commaunding of them all. For if hee may not commaund them, then that Law doth wrong, that bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:18659:210"/>
him to bring them foorth to bee iustified. And if hee may commaund them, then hee may commaund them aswell to ill as to good. Heereby the Lords and Captaines of Countreyes, the principall and heades of septs are made stronger, whome it should bee a most speciall care in policie to weaken, and to set up and strengthen diverse of his underlings against him, which whensoever hee shall offer to swarve from duty, may bee able to beard him; for it is very dangerous to leave the commaund of so many as some septs are, being five or sixe thousand persons, to the will of one man, who may leade them to what he will, as he himselfe shall be inclined.</p>

                     <p>In very deede <hi>Iren.</hi> it is very dangerous, seeing the disposition of those people is not alwayes inclineable to the best. And therefore I holde it no wisedome to leave unto them too much commaund over their kinred, but rather to with-drawe their followers from them asmuch as may bee, and to gather them under the commaund of Law, by some better meane then this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of <hi>Kin-cogish.</hi> The which word I would bee glad to know what it namely signifieth, for the meaning thereof I seeme to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand reasonably well.</p>

                     <p>Indeede <hi>Eudox.</hi> you say very true; for all the customes of the <hi>Irish</hi> which I have often noted and compared with that I have read, would minister occasion of a most ample discourse of the originall of them, and the antiquity of that people, which in truth I thinke to bee more auncient then most that I know in this end of the world, so as if it were in the handling of some man of sound judgement and plentifull reading, it would bee most pleasant and profitable. But it may bee wee may at some other time of meeting, take occasion to treate thereof more at large.

                     <p>Before we enter into the treatie of their customes, it is first needfull to consider from whence they first sprung<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for from the sundry manners of the nations, from whence that people which now is called <hi>Irish,</hi> were derived, some of the customes which now remain amongst them, have beene first fetcht, and sithence there continued amongst them; for not of one nation was it peopled, as it is, but of sundry people of different conditions and manners. But the chiefest which have first possessed and inhabited it, I suppose to bee <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians.</hi>

                     <p>They doe indeed, but (I conceive) without any good ground. For if there were any such notable transmission of a Colony hether out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> or any such famous conquest of this Kingdome by <hi>Gathelus</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> as they would faine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, it is not unlikely, but that the very Chronicles of <hi>Spaine,</hi> (had <hi>Spaine</hi> then beene in so high regard, as they now have it) would not have omitted so memorable a thing, as the subduing of so noble a Realme to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> no more then they doe now neglect to memorize their conquest of the <hi>Indians,</hi> specially in those times, in which the same was supposed, being nearer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the flourishing age of learning and Writers under the <hi>Romanes.</hi> But the <hi>Irish</hi> doe heerein no otherwise, then our vaine <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> doe in the Tale of <hi>Brutus,</hi> whom they devise to have first conquered and inhabited this Land, it being as impossible to proove, that there was ever any such <hi>Brutus</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as it is, that there was any such <hi>Gathelus</hi> of <hi>Spaine.</hi> But sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Scythians</hi> (of whom I earst spoke) at such time as the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne nations over-flowed all Christendome, came downe to the sea-coast, where inquiring for other Countries abroad, &amp; getting intelligence of this countrey of <hi>Ireland,</hi> finding shipping convenient, passed thither, and arrived in the North part thereof, which is now called <hi>Vlster,</hi> which first inhabiting, and afterwards stretching them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves forth into the Land, as their numbers increased, named it all of themselves <hi>Scuttenland,</hi> which more briefly is called <hi>Scutland,</hi> or <hi>Scotland.</hi>

conferring of times, language, monuments, and such like, I doe hunt out a probability of things, which I leave to your judgement to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve or refuse.

For where you say the <hi>Irish</hi> have alwayes bin without letters, you are therein much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; for it is certaine, that <hi>Ireland</hi> hath had the use of letters very anciently, and long before <hi>England.</hi>

                     <p>It is hard to say, for whether they at their first comming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Land, or afterwards by trading with other nations which had letters, learned them of them, or devised them amongst themselves, is very doubtfull, but that they had letters aunciently, is nothing doubtfull, for the <hi>Saxons</hi> of <hi>England</hi> are said to have their letters, &amp; learning, and learned men from the <hi>Irish,</hi> and that also appeareth by the likenesse of the Character, for the <hi>Saxons</hi> Character
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18659:212"/>
is the same with the <hi>Irish.</hi> Now the <hi>Scythians,</hi> never, as I can reade, of old had letters amongst them, therfore it seemeth that they had them from the nation which came out of <hi>Spaine,</hi> for in <hi>Spaine</hi> there was (as <hi>Strabo</hi> writeth) letters anciently used, whether brought unto them by the <hi>Phenicians,</hi> or the <hi>Persians,</hi> which (as it appeareth by him) had some footing there, or from <hi>Marsellis,</hi> which is said to have bin inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by the <hi>Greekes,</hi> &amp; from them to have had the <hi>Greeke</hi> Character, of which <hi>Marsilians</hi> it is said, that the <hi>Gaules</hi> learned them first, &amp; u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them only for the furtherance of their trades &amp; privat busines, for the <hi>Gaules</hi> (as is strongly to be proved by many ancient &amp; authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call writers) did first inhabite all the sea coast of <hi>Spaine,</hi> even unto <hi>Cales,</hi> &amp; the mouth of the straights, &amp; peopled also a great part of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> which appeareth by sundry havens &amp; cities in <hi>Spaine</hi> called from them, as <hi>Portugallia, Gallecia, Galdunum,</hi> &amp; also by sundry nations ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in dwelling, which yet have received their own names of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> as the <hi>Rhegni, Presamarei, Tamari, Cineri,</hi> and divers others. All which <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> being himselfe a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> yet saith to have descended from the <hi>Celts</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> whereby it is to be gathered, that that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which came out of <hi>Spaine</hi> into <hi>Ireland,</hi> were anciently <hi>Gaules,</hi> and that they brought with them those letters which they had anciently learned in <hi>Spaine,</hi> first into <hi>Ireland,</hi> which some also say, doe much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble the olde <hi>Phenician</hi> Character, being likewise distinguished with pricke and accent, as theirs aunciently, but the further enquirie hereof needeth a place of longer discourse then this our short confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>

Giants dwelling then in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and at the last quite banished and rooted out, after whom 200. yeares, the sonnes of one <hi>Dela,</hi> being <hi>Scythians</hi> arrived there againe, and possessed the whole land, of which the youngest called <hi>Slanius,</hi> in the end made himselfe <hi>Monarch.</hi> Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the 4. sonnes of <hi>Milesius</hi> King of Spaine, which conquered the land from the <hi>Scythians,</hi> and inhabited it with <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and called it of the name of the yongest <hi>Hiberus, Hibernia</hi>: All which are in truth fables, and very <hi>Milesian</hi> lyes, as the later proverbe is: for never was there such a King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> called <hi>Milesius,</hi> nor any such Colonie seated with his sonnes as they faine, that can ever be proved, but yet under these tales you may in a manner see the truth lurke. For <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> here inhabiting, they name and put <hi>Spaniards,</hi> whereby appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that both these nations here inhabited, but whether very <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> as the <hi>Irish</hi> greatly affect, is no wayes to be proved.</p>

                     <p>Even of a very desire of new fanglenes and vanity, for they derive themselves from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as seeing them to bee a very honourable people, and neere bordering unto them: but all that is most vaine, for from the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that now are, or that people that now inhabite <hi>Spaine,</hi> they no wayes can prove themselves to descend; neither should it be greatly glorious unto them, for the <hi>Spaniard</hi> that now is, is come from as rude and savage nations as they, there being, as there may be gathered by course of ages, and view of their owne History (though they therein labour much to enoble themselves) scarce any drop of the old <hi>Spanish</hi> blood left in them, for all <hi>Spaine</hi> was first conquered by the <hi>Romans,</hi> and filled with colonies from them, which were still increased, and the native <hi>Spaniard</hi> still cut off.

The which Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne nations finding the nature of the soyle, and the vehement heat thereof farre differing from their constitutions, tooke no felicity in that Country, but from thence passed over, and did spread them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into all Countryes of Christendome, of all which there is

The which though after they were beaten out by <hi>Ferdinando</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> his wife, yet they were not so cleansed, but that through the marriages which they had made, and mixture with the people of the land, during their long continuance there, they had left no pure drop of <hi>Spanish</hi> blood, no more then of <hi>Roman</hi> or of <hi>Scythian.</hi> So that of all nations under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (I suppose) the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is the most mingled, and most uncertaine, wherefore most foolishly doe the <hi>Irish</hi> thinke to enoble themselves by wresting their Auncientry from the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who is unable to derive himselfe from any in certaine.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Gaulish</hi> speech, is the very <hi>British,</hi> the which was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry generally used here in all <hi>Brittaine,</hi> before the comming of the <hi>Saxons</hi>: and yet is retained of the <hi>Welshmen, Cornishmen,</hi> and the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> though time working the alterarion of all things, and the trading and interdeale with other nations round about, have changed and greatly altered the dialect thereof, but yet the originall words appeare to be the same, as who hath list to read in <hi>Camden</hi> and <hi>Buchanan,</hi> may see at large. Besides there be many places, as havens, hills, townes and Castles, which yet beare the names from the <hi>Gaules,</hi> of the which, <hi>Buchanan</hi> rehearseth above 500. in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and I can

(I thinke) recount neere as many in <hi>Ireland</hi> which retaine the old de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> as the <hi>Menapij, Cauci, Venti,</hi> and others; by all which and many other reasonable probabilities (which this short course will not suffer to be laide forth) it appeareth that the cheife Inhabitants in <hi>Ireland</hi> were <hi>Gaules,</hi> comming thither first out of <hi>Spain,</hi> and after from besides <hi>Tanais,</hi> where the <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>This is very likely, for even so did those <hi>Gaules</hi> anciently possesse all the southerne coasts of our <hi>Brittaine,</hi> which yet retaine their old names, as the <hi>Belga,</hi> in <hi>Sommerset-shire, Wilshire,</hi> and part of <hi>Hamshire, Attrebatij</hi> in <hi>Barkeshire, Regni</hi> in <hi>Sussex</hi> and <hi>Surry,</hi> and many others. Now thus farre then, I understand your opinion, that the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> planted in the north part of <hi>Ireland</hi>: the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (for so we call them, what ever they were that came from <hi>Spaine</hi>) in the west, the <hi>Gaules</hi> in the south: so that there now remaineth the east parts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>England,</hi> which I would be glad to understand from whence you doe thinke them to be peopled.</p>

Yet amongst the <hi>Tooles,</hi> the <hi>Birns,</hi> or <hi>Brins,</hi> the <hi>Cavenaghes</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and other nations in <hi>Leinster,</hi> there is some memory of the <hi>Britans</hi> remayning. As the <hi>Tooles</hi> are called of the old British word <hi>Tol,</hi> that is, a hill Countrey, the <hi>Brins</hi> of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish word <hi>Brin,</hi> that is, woods, and the <hi>Cavenaghes</hi> of the word <hi>Caune,</hi> that is, strong, so that in these three people the very denomination of the old <hi>Britons</hi> doe still remaine. Besides when any flieth under the succour and protection of any against an enemie, he cryeth unto him, <hi>Comericke,</hi> that is in the Brittish, helpe, for the <hi>Brittaine</hi> is called in their owne language, <hi>Comeroy.</hi> Furthermore to prove the same, <hi>Ireland</hi> is by <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> and by <hi>Strabo,</hi> called <hi>Britannia,</hi> and a part of great <hi>Brittaine.</hi> Finally it appeareth by good record yet extant, that King <hi>Arthur,</hi> and after him <hi>Gurgunt,</hi> had all that Iland under their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagiance and subjection, hereunto I could add many probabilities of the names of places, persons, and speeches, as I did in the former, but they should be too long for this, and I reserve them for another. And thus you have had my opinion, how all that Realme of <hi>Ireland</hi> was first peopled, and by what nations. After all which the <hi>Saxons</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, subdued it wholly to themselves. For first <hi>Egfrid</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> did utterly waste and subdue it, as appeareth out of <hi>Beda's</hi> complaint against him, and after him, King <hi>Edgar</hi> brought it under his obedience, as appeareth by an auncient Record, in which
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:18659:214"/>
it is found written, that he subdued all the Islands of the North, even unto <hi>Norway,</hi> and brought them into his subjection.</p>

                     <p>Yes, there was another, and that last and greatest, which was by the <hi>English,</hi> when the Earle <hi>Strangbowe</hi> having conquered that land, delivered up the same into the hands of <hi>Henry</hi> the second then King, who sent over thither, great store of Gentlemen, and other warlike people, amongst whom, he distributed the Land, and setled such a strong Colonie therein, as never since could with all the subtle practices of the <hi>Irish</hi> be rooted out, but abide still a mighty people, of so many as remaine <hi>English</hi> of them.</p>

                     <p>Truely very materiall, for if you marked the course of all that speech well, it was to shew, by what meanes the customes, that

now are in <hi>Ireland,</hi> being some of them indeede very strange and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most heathenish, were first brought in: and that was, as I said, by those Nations from whom that Countrey was first peopled; for the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in manners and customes, doth follow the difference of nations and people. The which I have declared to you, to have beene three especially which seated themselves here: to wit first the <hi>Scythian,</hi> then the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and lastly the <hi>English.</hi> Notwithstanding that I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that there were sundry Nations which go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>I will begin then to count their customes in the same or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that I counted their Nations, and first with the <hi>Scythian</hi> or <hi>Scottish</hi> manners. Of the which there is one use, amongst them to keepe their cattle, and to live themselves the most part of the yeare in <hi>Boolies,</hi> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturing upon the mountaine, and waste wilde places; and removing still to fresh land, as they have depastured the former. The which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth plaine to be the manner of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> as you may read in <hi>Olaus Magnus,</hi> and <hi>Io: Bohemus,</hi> and yet is used, amongst all the <hi>Tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> and the people about the <hi>Caspian Sea,</hi> which are naturally <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> to live in heards as they call them, being the very same, that the <hi>Irish Boolies</hi> are, driving their cattle continually with them, and feeding onely on their milke and white meates.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>What fault can you finde with this custome? for though it be an old <hi>Scythian</hi> use, yet is it very behoofefull in this Country of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where there are great mountaines, and waste deserts full of grasse, that the same should be eaten downe, and nourish many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands of cattle, for the good of the whole Realme, which cannot (me thinks) well be any other way, then by keeping those <hi>Boolies</hi> there, as yee have shewed.</p>

                     <p>But by this custome of <hi>Boolying,</hi> there grow in the meane time many great enormityes unto that Common-wealth. For first if there be any out-lawes, or loose people, (as they are never without some) which live upon stealthes and spoyles, they are evermore succoured and finde releife only in these <hi>Boolies,</hi> being upon the waste places, whereas else they should be driven shortly to starve, or to come downe to the townes to seeke releife, where by one meanes or other, they would soone be caught. Besides such stealthes of cattle as they make, they bring commonly to those <hi>Boolies,</hi> being upon those waste places, where they are readily received, and the theife harboured from danger of law, or such Officers as might light upon him. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the people that thus live in those <hi>Boolies,</hi> grow thereby the more
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18659:215"/>
barbarous, and live more licentiously then they could in Townes, using what manners they list, and practizing what mischeifes and villainies they will, either against the government there, by their combynations, or against private men, whom they maligne, by stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their goods, or murdering themselves. For there they thinke themselves halfe exempted from law and obedience, and having once tasted freedome, doe like a steere, that hath beene long out of his yoke, grudge and repyne ever after, to come under Rule againe.</p>

                     <p>They have another custome from the <hi>Scythians,</hi> that is the wearing of <hi>Mantles,</hi> and long <hi>Glibbes,</hi> which is a thicke curled bush of haire, hanging downe over their eyes, and monstrously disguising them, which are both very bad and hurtfull.</p>

                     <p>Doe you thinke that the <hi>Mantle</hi> commeth from the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians?</hi> I would surely thinke otherwise, for by that which I have read, it appeareth that most Nations of the world aunciently used the <hi>Mantle.</hi> For the <hi>Iewes</hi> used it, as you may read of <hi>Elyas Mantle,</hi> &amp;c. The <hi>Chaldees</hi> also used it, as yee may read in <hi>Diodorus.</hi> The <hi>Egyptians</hi> likewise used it, as yee may read in <hi>Herodotus,</hi> and may bee gathered by the description of <hi>Berenice,</hi> in the <hi>Greeke</hi> Commentary upon <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus.</hi> The <hi>Greekes</hi> also used it aunciently, as appeareth by <hi>Venus Mantle</hi> lyned with starrs, though afterwards they changed the forme thereof into their cloakes, called <hi>Pallia,</hi> as some of the <hi>Irish</hi> also use. And the auncient <hi>Latines</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> used it, as you may read in <hi>Virgil,</hi> who was a very great Antiquary. That <hi>Euander,</hi> when <hi>Aenaeas</hi> came to him at his Feast, did entertaine and feast him, sitting on the ground, and lying on <hi>Mantles.</hi> Insomuch as he useth the very word <hi>Mantile</hi> for a <hi>Mantle.</hi>
                        <q>—Humi mantilia sternunt.</q>
So that it seemeth that the <hi>Mantle</hi> was a generall habite to most Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and not proper to the <hi>Scythians</hi> onely, as you suppose.</p>

                     <p>I cannot deny but that aunciently it was common to most, and yet sithence disused and laide away. But in this later age of the world, since the decay of the <hi>Romane Empire,</hi> it was renewed and brought in againe by those Northerne nations, when breaking out of their cold caves and frozen habitations, into the sweet soyle of <hi>Europe,</hi> they brought with them their usuall weedes, fit to sheild the cold, and that continuall frost, to which they had at home beene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured: the which yet they left not off, by reason that they were in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall warres, with the Nations whom they had invaded, but still removing from place to place, carried alwayes with them that weed, as their house, their bed, and their garment, and comming lastly into <hi>Ireland,</hi> they found there more speciall use thereof, by reason of the rawe cold climate, from whom it is now growne into that generall

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie: for the inconveniences which thereby doe arise, are much more many. For it is a fit house for an Out-law, a meet bed for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, &amp; an apt cloake for a thiefe. First the Out-law being for his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny crimes and villanyes, banished from the Townes &amp; houses of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men, &amp; wandring in waste places, far from danger of law, maketh his Mantle his house, &amp; under it covereth himselfe from the wrath of Heaven, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the offence of the Earth, &amp; from the sight of men. When it raineth it is his pent-house; when it bloweth it is tent, when it free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth it is his Tabernacle. In sommer he can weare it loose, in winter he can wrap it close, at all times he can use it; never heavy, never cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersome. Likewise for a Rebell it is as serviceable. For in his warre that he maketh (if at least it deserve the name of warre) when he still flyeth from his foe, &amp; lurketh in the thicke woods &amp; straite passages, waiting for advantages, it is his bed, yea and almost as his houshold stuff. For the wood is his house against all weathers, &amp; his Mantle is his couch to sleepe in. Therein he wrappeth himself round, &amp; couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himselfe strongly against the gnats, which in that countrey doe more annoy the naked Rebels, whilst they keepe the woods, &amp; doe more sharply wound them then all their enemies swords, or speares, which can seldome come nigh them: yea &amp; oftentimes their Mantle serveth them, when they are neere driven, being wrapped about their left arme in steed of a Target, for it is hard to cut thorough with a sword, besides it is light to beare, light to throw away, and being (as they commonly are) naked, it is to them all in all. Lastly for a Theife it is so handsome, as it may seeme it was first invented for him, for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it he may cleanly convey any fit pillage that commeth handsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his way, &amp; when he goeth abroad in the night in free-booting, it is his best &amp; surest friend; for lying as they often do 2. or 3. nights to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether abroad to watch for their booty, with that they can prettily shroud themselves under a bush or a banke side, till they may conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently do their errand: &amp; when all is over, he can in his mantle passe thorough any town or company, being close hooded over his head, as he useth, from knowledge of any to whom he is indangered. Besides this, he or any man els that is disposed to mischief or villany, may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his mantle goe privily armed without suspition of any, carry his head-peece, his skean, or pistol if he please, to be alwayes in readines. Thus necessary &amp; fitting is a mantle for a bad man, &amp; surely for a bad huswife it is no lesse convenient, for some of them that bee wandring woemen, called of them <hi>Mona-Shul,</hi> it is halfe a wardrobe: for in sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer you shal find her arrayed commonly, but in her smock &amp; mantle
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:18659:216"/>
to be more ready for her light services: in winter, and in her travaile, it is her cloake and safeguard, and also a coverlet for her lewde exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise. And when she hath filled her vessell, under it she can hide both her burden, and her blame; yea, and when her Bastard is borne, it serves insteed of swadling clouts. And as for all other good women which love to doe but little worke, how handsome it is to lye in and sleepe, or to louse themselves in the Sun-shine, they that have beene but a while in <hi>Ireland</hi> can well witnes. Sure I am that you will thinke it very unfit for a good huswife to stirre in, or to busie her selfe about her huswifry in such sort as she should. These be some of the abuses for which I would thinke it meet to forbid all Mantles.</p>

                     <p>O evill minded man, that having reckoned up so many uses of a Mantle, will yet wish it to be abandoned! Sure I thinke <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogenes</hi> dish did never serve his Master for more turnes, notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that he made it his Dish, his Cup, his Cap, his Measure, his Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-pot, then a Mantle doth an <hi>Irish</hi> man. But I see they be most to bad intents, &amp; therefore I will joyne with you in abolishing it. But what blame lay you to the glibbe? take heed (I pray you) that you be not too busie therewith for feare of your owne blame, seeing our <hi>Englishmen</hi> take it up in such a generall fashion to weare their haire so immeasurably long, that some of them exceed the longest <hi>Irish</hi> glibs.</p>

                     <p>I feare not the blame of any undeserved dislikes: but for the <hi>Irish</hi> glibbes, they are as fit maskes as a mantle is for a thiefe. For whensoever he hath run himselfe into that perill of Law, that he will not be knowne, he either cutteth off his glibbe quite, by which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth nothing like himselfe, or pulleth it so low downe over his eyes, that it is very hard to discerne his theevish countenance. And therefore fit to be trussed up with the Mantle.</p>

                     <p>Truly these three <hi>Scythian</hi> abuses, I hold most fit to bee taken away with sharpe penalties, and sure I wonder how they have beene kept thus long, notwithstanding so many good provisions and orders, as have beene devised for that people.</p>

                     <p>The cause thereof shall appeare to you hereafter: but let us now go forward with our <hi>Scythian</hi> customes. Of which the next that I have to treat of, is the manner of raising the cry in their conflicts, &amp; at other troublesome times of uproare: the which is very natural <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian,</hi> as you may read in <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> &amp; in <hi>Herodotus,</hi> describing the maner of the <hi>Scythians</hi> &amp; <hi>Parthians</hi> comming to give the charge at battles: at which it is said that they came running with a terrible yell as if heaven &amp; earth would have gone together, which is the very I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the <hi>Irish Hubub,</hi> which their <hi>Kerne</hi> use at their first encounter. Besides, the same <hi>Herodotus</hi> writeth, that they used in their battles to call upon the names of their Captains or Generals, &amp; somtimes upon their greatest Kings deceased, as in that battle of <hi>Thomyris</hi> against <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus:</hi> which custome to this day manifestly appeareth amongst the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</hi> For at their joyning of Battle, they likewise call upon their Captaines name, or the word of his Auncestours. As they under
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18659:216"/>
                        <hi>Oneale</hi> cry <hi>Laundarg-abo,</hi> that is, the bloody hand, which is <hi>Oneales</hi> badge. They under <hi>O Brien</hi> call <hi>Laun-laider,</hi> that is, the strong hand. And to their ensample, the old <hi>English</hi> also which there remayneth, have gotten up their cryes <hi>Scythian</hi>-like, as <hi>Crom-abo,</hi> and <hi>Butler-abo.</hi> And here also lyeth open an other manifest proofe, that the <hi>Irish</hi> bee <hi>Scythes</hi> or <hi>Scots,</hi> for in all their incounters they use one very common word, crying <hi>Ferragh, Ferragh,</hi> which is a <hi>Scottish</hi> word, to wit, the name of one of the first Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> called <hi>Feragus,</hi> or <hi>Fergus,</hi> which fought against the <hi>Pictes,</hi> as you may reade in <hi>Buchanan, de rebus Scoticis</hi>; but as others write, it was long before that, the name of their chiefe Captaine, under whom they fought against the <hi>Africans,</hi> the which was then so fortunate unto them, that ever sithence they have used to call upon his name in their battailes.</p>

                     <p>Believe me, this observation of yours <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> is very good and delightfull; far beyond the blinde conceipt of some, who (I remember) have upon the same word <hi>Ferragh,</hi> made a very blunt conjecture, as namely M. <hi>Stanihurst,</hi> who thogh he be the same coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyman borne, that should search more neerely into the secret of these things, yet hath strayed from the truth all the heavens wyde, (as they say) for he thereupon groundeth a very grosse imagination, that the <hi>Irish</hi> should descend from the <hi>Egyptians</hi> which came into that Island, first under the leading of one <hi>Scota</hi> the daughter of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> whereupon they use (saith he) in all their battailes, to call upon the name of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> crying <hi>Ferragh, Ferragh.</hi> Surely he shootes wyde on the Bow hand, &amp; very far from the marke. For I would first know of him what auncient ground of authority he hath for such a senselesse fable, &amp; if he have any of the rude <hi>Irish</hi> bookes, as it may be hee hath, yet (me seemes) that a man of his learning should not so lightly have bin carried away with old wives tales, from approvance of his owne reason, for whether it be a smack of any learned iudgment, to say, that <hi>Scota</hi> is like an <hi>Egyptian</hi> word, let the learned iudge. But his <hi>Scota</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comes of the <hi>Greeke</hi> σκότοσ, that is, darknes, which hath not let him see the light of the truth.</p>

                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>You know not <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> how well M. <hi>Stan.</hi> could see in the darke, perhaps he hath Owles or Cats eyes: but well I wot he seeth not well the very light in matters of more weight. But as for <hi>Ferragh</hi> I have told my coniecture only, and yet thus much I have more to prove a likelyhood, that there be yet at this day in <hi>Ireland,</hi> many <hi>Irish</hi> men (chiefly in the Northerne parts) called by the name of <hi>Ferragh.</hi> But let that now be: this only for this place suffiseth, that it is a word used in their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon hububs, the which (with all the rest) is to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished, for that it discovereth an affectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to <hi>Irish</hi> captainry, which in this platform I indevour specially to beat down. There be other sorts of cryes also used among the <hi>Irish,</hi> which savour greatly of the <hi>Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> barbarisme, as their lamentations at their buryals, with dispairfull out-cryes, and immoderate waylings, the which Master <hi>Stanihurst</hi> might also have used for an Argument to proove them <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
                        <pb n="40" facs="tcp:18659:217"/>
For so in Scripture it is mentioned, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> lamented for the death of <hi>Ioseph.</hi> Others thinke this custome to come from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> for that they doe immeasurably likewise bewayle their dead. But the same is not proper <hi>Spanish,</hi> but altogether Heathenish, brought in thither first either by the <hi>Scythians,</hi> or the <hi>Moores</hi> that were <hi>Africans,</hi> and long possessed that Countrey. For it is the manner of all <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> to be intemperate in their waylings of their dead, for that they had no faith nor hope of salvation. And this ill cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome also is specially noted by <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> to have beene in the <hi>Scythians,</hi> and is yet amongst the Northerne <hi>Scots</hi> at this day, as you may reade in their Chronicles.</p>

                     <p>I did not rehearse it as one of the abuses which I thought most worthie of reformation; but having made mention of <hi>Irish</hi> cryes I thought this manner of lewd crying and howling, not impertinent to be noted as uncivill and <hi>Scythian</hi>-like: for by these old customes, and other like coniecturall circumstances, the descents of nations can only be proved, where other monuments of writings are not remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>

                     <p>Then sith you will have it so, I will heere take occasion, since I lately spake of their manner of cryes in ioyning of battaile, to speake also somewhat of the manner of their Armes, and array in Battell, with other customes perhappes worthy the noting. And first of their Armes and Weapons, amongst which their broad Swordes are proper <hi>Scythian,</hi> for such the <hi>Scythes</hi> used commonly, as you may read in <hi>Olaus Magnus.</hi> And the same also the old <hi>Scots</hi> used, as you may read in <hi>Buchanan,</hi> and in <hi>Solinus,</hi> where the pictures of them are in the same forme expressed.

                        <hi>Scythian,</hi> as you may reade in the same <hi>Olaus.</hi> And the same sort both of Bowes, Quivers, and Arrowes, are at this day to bee seene commonly amongst the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne <hi>Irish-Scots,</hi> whose <hi>Scottish</hi> Bowes are not past three quarters of a yard long, with a string of wreathed hempe slackely bent, and whose Arrowes are not much above halfe an ell long, tipped with steele heads, made like common broad Arrow heades, but much more sharpe and slender, that they enter into a man or horse most cruelly, notwithstanding that they are shot foorth weakely. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over their long broad Shields, made but with wicker roddes, which are commonly used amongst the said Northerne <hi>Irish,</hi> but especially of the <hi>Scots,</hi> are brought from the <hi>Scythians,</hi> as you may read in <hi>Olaus Magnus, Solinus,</hi> &amp; others: likwise their going to battle without armor on their bodies or heads, but trusting to the thicknes of their glibbs,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18659:217"/>
the which (they say) will sometimes beare off a good stroke, is meere <hi>Scythian,</hi> as you may see in the said Images of the old <hi>Scythes</hi> or <hi>Scots,</hi> set foorth by <hi>Herodianus</hi> and others. Besides, their confused kinde of march in heapes, without any order or array, their clashing of swords together, their fierce running upon their enemies, and their manner of fight, resembleth altogether that which is read in histories to have beene used of the <hi>Scythians.</hi> By which it may almost infallibly be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together, with other circumstances, that the <hi>Irish</hi> are very <hi>Scots</hi> or <hi>Scythes</hi> originally, though sithence intermingled with many other Nations repairing and joyning unto them. And to these I may also adde another strong conjecture which commeth to my mind, that I have often observed there amongst them, that is, certain religious ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, which are very superstitiously yet used amongst them, the which are also written by sundry authours, to have bin observed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Scythians,</hi> by which it may very vehemently be presumed that the nations were anciently all one. For <note n="*" place="margin">Not he, but <hi>Herodotus</hi> in the life of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> (as I remember) in his treatise of <hi>Homer,</hi> indeavouring to search out the truth, what countryman <hi>Homer</hi> was, prooveth it most strongly (as he thinketh) that he was an <hi>Aeolian</hi> borne, for that in describing a sacrifice of the <hi>Greekes,</hi> he omitted the loyne, the which all the other <hi>Grecians</hi> (saving the <hi>Aeolians</hi>) use to burne in their sacrifices: also for that he makes the intralls to be rosted on five spits, which was the proper manner of the <hi>Aeolians,</hi> who onely of all the nations of <hi>Grecia,</hi> used to sacrifize in that sort. By which he inferreth necessarily, that <hi>Homer</hi> was an <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olian.</hi> And by the same reason may I as reasonably conclude, that the <hi>Irish</hi> are descended from the <hi>Scythians,</hi> for that they use (even to this day) some of the same ceremonies which the <hi>Scythians</hi> anciently used. As for example, you may reade in <hi>Lucian</hi> in that sweet Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, which is intitled <hi>Toxaris,</hi> or of friendship, that the common oath of the <hi>Scythians</hi> was by the sword, and by the fire, for that they accounted those two speciall divine powers, which should worke vengeance on the perjurers. So doe the <hi>Irish</hi> at this day when they goe to battaile, say certaine prayers or charmes to their swords, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a crosse therewith upon the earth, and thrusting the points of their blades into the ground, thinking thereby to have the better suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse in fight. Also they use commonly to sweare by their swords. Also the <hi>Scythians</hi> used when they would binde any solemne vow or combination amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to drink a Bowle of blood together, vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therby to spend their last blood in that quarrell: &amp; even so do the wild <hi>Scots,</hi> as you may read in <hi>Buchanan:</hi> and some of the Northerne <hi>Irish.</hi> Likewise at the kindling of the Fire, and lighting of Candles, they say certaine prayers, &amp; use some other superstitious rites, which shew that they honour the Fire and the light: for all those Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne Nations having beene used to be annoyed with much colde and darkenesse, are wont therefore to have the Fire and the Sunne in great veneration; like as contrarywise the <hi>Moores</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> which are much offended and grieved with extreame heat of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18659:218"/>
Sunne, doe every morning when the Sunne ariseth, fall to cursing and banning of him as their plague. You may also reade in the same booke, in the tale of <hi>Arsacomas,</hi> that it was the manner of the <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> when any one of them was heavily wronged, and would as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble unto him any forces of people to joyne with him in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, to sit in some publicke place for certaine dayes upon an Oxe hide, to which there would resort all such persons as being disposed to take Armes, would enter into his pay, or joyne with him in his quarrell. And the same you may likewise reade to have beene the ancient manner of the wilde <hi>Scotts,</hi> which are indeed the very natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Irish.</hi> Moreover the <hi>Scythians</hi> used to sweare by their Kings hand, as <hi>Olaus</hi> sheweth. And so do the <hi>Irish</hi> use now to sweare by their Lords hand, and to forsweare it, holde it more criminall then to sweare by God. Also the <hi>Scythians</hi> said, that they were once a yeare tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Wolves, and so is it written of the <hi>Irish:</hi> Though Master <hi>Camden</hi> in a better sense doth suppose it was a disease, called <hi>Lycan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropia,</hi> so named of the Wolfe. And yet some of the <hi>Irish</hi> doe use to make the Wolfe their Gossip. The <hi>Scythians</hi> used also to see the the flesh in the hide: &amp; so doe the Northerne <hi>Irish.</hi> The <hi>Scythians</hi> used to draw the blood of the beast living, &amp; to make meat thereof: &amp; so doe the <hi>Irish</hi> in the North still. Many such customes I could recount unto you, as of their old manner of marrying, of burying, of dancing, of singing, of feasting, of cursing, though Christians have wyped out the most part of them, by resemblance, whereof it might plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to you, that the Nations are the same, but that by the reckoning of these few, which I have told unto you, I finde my speech drawne out to a greater length then I purposed. Thus much onely for this time I hope shall suffise you, to thinke that the <hi>Irish</hi> are anciently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the <hi>Scythians.</hi>

But there are fewer remayning of the <hi>Gaules</hi> or <hi>Spaniards,</hi> then of the <hi>Scythians,</hi> by reason that the partes, which they then possessed, lying upon the coast of the Westerne and Southerne Sea, were sithence vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited with strangers and forraine people, repayring thither for traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke, and for fishing, which is very plentifull upon those coasts: for the trade and interdeale of Sea-coast Nations one with another, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth more civilitie and good fashions, (all Sea men being naturally desirous of new fashions,) then amongst the Inland folke, which are seldome seene of forrainers; yet some of such as I have noted, I will recount unto you. And first I will for the better credit of the rest, shew you one out of their Statutes, among which it is enacted, that no man shall weare his beard onely on the upper lip, shaving all his Chinne. And this was the auncient manner of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as yet it is of all the <hi>Mahometans</hi> to cut off all their beards close, save onelie their <hi>Muschachios,</hi> which they weare long. And the cause of this use, was for that they being bred in a hot countrey, found much haire on their faces and other parts to be noyous unto them: for which cause they did cut it most away, like as contrarily all other nations brought up in cold countryes, doe use to nourish their haire, to keepe them the warmer, which was the cause that the <hi>Scythians</hi> and <hi>Scottes</hi> wore Glibbes (as I shewed you) to keepe their heads warme, and long beards to defend their face, from cold. From them also (I thinke) came saffron shirts and smocks, which was devised by them in those hote Countryes, where saffron is very common and rife, for avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that evill which commeth by much sweating, and long wearing of Linnen: Also the Woemen amongst the old <hi>Spaniards</hi> had the charge of all houshold affaires, both at home and abroad, (as <hi>Boemus</hi> writeth) though now the <hi>Spaniards</hi> use it quite otherwise. And so have the <hi>Irish</hi> weomen the trust and care of all things, both at home, and in the field. Likewise round leather Targets is the <hi>Spanish</hi> fashion, who used it (for the most part) painted, which in <hi>Ireland</hi> they use also in many places, coloured after their rude fashion. Moreover the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their Woemens riding on the wrong side of the horse, I meane with their faces towards the right side, as the <hi>Irish</hi> use, is (as they say) old <hi>Spanish,</hi> and some say <hi>African,</hi> for amongst them the woemen (they say) use so to ride. Also the deepe smocke sleive, which the <hi>Irish</hi> women use, they say was old <hi>Spanish,</hi> and is used yet in <hi>Barbary</hi>: and yet that should seeme rather to be an old <hi>English</hi> fashion, for in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory the fashion of the <hi>Manche,</hi> which is given in Armes, by many being indeede nothing else but a sleive, is fashioned much like to that sleive. And that Knights in auncient times used to weare their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses or Loves sleive, upon their Armes, as appeareth by that which is written of Sir <hi>Launcelot,</hi> that he wore the sleive of the faire maide of <hi>Asteloth</hi> in a Tourney, whereat Queene <hi>Gueneuer</hi> was much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased.</p>

                     <p>I have observed a few of either; and who will better search into them, may finde more. And first the profession of their <hi>Bardes</hi> was (as <hi>Caesar</hi> writeth) usuall amongst the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and the same was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so common amongst the <hi>Brittans,</hi> and is not yet altogether left off, with the <hi>Welsh</hi> which are their posterity. For all the fashions of the <hi>Gaules</hi> and <hi>Brittaines,</hi> as he testifieth, were much like. The long darts came also from the <hi>Gaules,</hi> as you may read in the same <hi>Caesar,</hi> and in <hi>Io: Boemus.</hi> Likewise the said <hi>Io: Boemus</hi> writeth, that the <hi>Gaules</hi> used Swords a handfull broad, and so doe the <hi>Irish</hi> now. Also they used long Wicker sheilds in Battaile that should cover their whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and so doe the Northerne <hi>Irish.</hi> But I have not seene such fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Targets used in the Southerne parts, but onely amongst the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne people, and <hi>Irish-Scottes,</hi> I doe thinke that they were brought in rather by the <hi>Scythians,</hi> then by the <hi>Gaules.</hi> Also the <hi>Gaules</hi> used to drinke their enemyes blood, and painte themselves therewith. So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so they write, that the old <hi>Irish</hi> were wont, and so have I seene some of the <hi>Irish</hi> doe, but not their enemyes, but freinds blood. As namely at the execution of a notable Traytor at <hi>Limericke,</hi> called <hi>Murrogh O-Brien,</hi> I saw an old woman, which was his foster mother, take up his head<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whilst he was quartered, and sucked up all the blood that runne thereout, saying, that the Earth was not worthy to drinke it, and therewith also steeped her face and breast, and tore her haire, cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out and shreeking most terribly.</p>

                     <p>You have very well runne thorough such customes as the <hi>Irish</hi> have derived from the first old Nations which inhabited the land: namely the <hi>Scythians,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the <hi>Gaules,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Brittaines.</hi> It now remaineth that you take in hand, the customes of the old <hi>English</hi> which are amongst the <hi>Irish</hi>: Of which I doe not thinke that you shall have much cause to finde fault with, considering that by the <hi>English,</hi> most of the old bad <hi>Irish</hi> customes were abolished, and more civill fashions brought in their stead.</p>

This you may read plainely discovered by a Letter written from the Cittizens of <hi>Corke</hi> out of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to the Earle of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> then in <hi>England,</hi> and remaining yet upon record, both in the Towre of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and also among the Chronicles of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Wherein it is by them complained, that the <hi>English</hi> Lords and Gentlemen, who then had great possessions in <hi>Ireland,</hi> began thorough pride and insolency, to make private warres one against another, and when either part was weak, they would wage &amp; draw in the <hi>Irish</hi> to take their part, by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> meanes they both greatly incouraged, and inabled the <hi>Irish,</hi> which till that time, had beene shut up within the mountaines of <hi>Slewlogher,</hi> and weakened and disabled themselves, insomuch that their revenues were wonderfully impaired, and some of them which are there rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned to have been able, to have spent 12. or 1300. pounds <hi>per annu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> of old rent (that I may say no more) besides their Commodities of Creekes and havens, were now scarce able to dispend the third part.

                     <p>You cannot but hold them sure to be very uncivill, for were they at the best that they were of old, when they were brought in, they should in so long an alteration of time seeme very uncouth and strange. For it is to be thought, that the use of all <hi>England,</hi> (was in the raigne of <hi>Henry</hi> the second, when <hi>Ireland</hi> was planted with <hi>English</hi>) very rude and barbarous, so as if the same should be now used in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by any, it would seeme worthy of sharpe correction, and of new lawes for reformation, for it is but even the other day, since <hi>England</hi> grew civill: Therefore in counting the evill customes of the <hi>English</hi> there, I will not have regard, whether the beginning thereof were <hi>English</hi> or <hi>Irish,</hi> but will have respect onely to the inconvenience thereof. And first I have to finde fault with the abuse of language, that is, for the speaking of <hi>Irish</hi> among the <hi>English,</hi> which as it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall that any people should love anothers language more then their owne, so it is very inconvenient, and the cause of many other evills.</p>

                     <p>It seemeth strange to me that the <hi>English</hi> should take more delight to speake that language, then their owne, whereas they should (mee thinkes) rather take scorne to acquaint their tongues thereto. For it hath ever beene the use of the <hi>Conquerour,</hi> to despise the language of the conquered, and to force him by all meanes to learne his. So did the <hi>Romans</hi> allwayes use, insomuch that there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most no Nation in the world, but is sprinckled with their language. It were good therefore (me seemes) to search out the originall cause of this evill, for the same being discovered, a redresse thereof will the more easily be provided: for (I thinke) it very strange, that the <hi>English</hi> being so many, and the <hi>Irish</hi> so few, as they then were left, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For besides that, yong Children be like Apes, which will affect and imitate what they see done before them, especially by their nurses whom they love so well, they moreover drawe into themselves, together with their sucke, even the nature and dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their nurses: for the minde followeth much the temperature of the body: and also the words are the image of the minde, so as they proceeding from the minde, the minde must needes be affected with the words. So that the speach being <hi>Irish,</hi> the heart must needes bee <hi>Irish</hi>
                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for out of the abundance of the heart, the tongue speaketh. The next is the marrying with the <hi>Irish,</hi> which how dangerous a thing it is in all common-wealthes, appeareth to every simplest sence, and though some great ones have perhaps used such matches with their Vassals, and have of them neverthelesse raised worthy issue, as <hi>Tela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> did with <hi>Termessa, Alexander</hi> the Great with <hi>Roxane,</hi> and <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> with <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> yet the example is so perillous, as it is not to be adventured: for in stead of those few good, I could count unto them infinite many evill. And indeed how can such matching succeede well, seeing that commonly the childe taketh most of his nature of the Mother, besides speach, manners, and inclynation, which are (for the most part) agreeable to the conditions of their mothers: for by them they are first framed and fashioned, so as what they receive once from them, they will hardly ever after forgoe. Therefore are these evill customes of fostering and marrying with the <hi>Irish,</hi> most carefully to be restrayned: for of them two, the third evill that is the custome of language, (which I spake of,) cheifly proceedeth.</p>

                     <p>Yes I thinke there be, but as good never a whit as never the better, for what doe Statutes availe without penalties, or lawes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out charge of execution? for so there is another like law enacted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst wearing of the <hi>Irish</hi> apparell, but neverthemore is it observed by any, or executed by them that have the charge: for they in their private discretions thinke it not fit to bee forced upon the poore wretches of that Country, which are not worth the price of <hi>English</hi> apparell, nor expedient to be practised against the abler sort, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that the country (say they) doth yeeld no better, and were there better to be had, yet these were fitter to be used, as namely the mantle in travailing, because there be no Innes where meete bedding may be had, so that his mantle serves him then for a bed. The leather quil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Iacke in journeying and in camping, for that it is fittest to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his shirt of Male, and for any occasion of suddaine service, as there happen many, to cover his trouse on horsebacke. The great linnen Roll, which the Women weare, to keepe their heads warme, after cutting their haire, which they use in any sickenesse. Besides their thicke folded linnen shirts, their long sleived smocks, their halfe slei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved coates, their silken fillets, and all the rest: they will devise some colour for, either of necessity, or of antiquity, or of comelynesse.</p>

                     <p>Yes surely but it is: for mens apparell is commonly made according to their conditions, &amp; their conditions are oftentimes go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by their garments: for the person that is gowned, is by his gowne put in minde of gravitie, and also restrained from lightnes, by the very unaptnesse of his weed. Therefore it is written by <hi>Aristotle,</hi> That when <hi>Cyrus</hi> had overcome the <hi>Lydians</hi> that were a warlike nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and devised to bring them to a more peaceable life, hee changed their apparell &amp; musick, and in stead of their short warlike coat, cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed them in long garments like women, and in stead of their war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like musick, appointed to them certaine lascivious layes, and loose Iiggs, by which in short space their mindes were so mollified and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, that they forgot their former fiercenesse, &amp; became most ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der &amp; effeminate, whereby it appeareth, that there is not a little in the garment to the fashioning of the minde and conditions. But be these which you have described, the fashions of the <hi>Irish</hi> weedes?</p>

                     <p>No: all these which I have rehearsed to you, bee not <hi>Irish</hi> garments, but <hi>English</hi>; for the quilted leather Iack is old <hi>English</hi>: for it was the proper weed of the horseman, as you may read in <hi>Chaucer,</hi> when he describeth Sir <hi>Thopas</hi> apparell and Armour, as hee went to fight against the Gyant, in his robe of Shecklaton, which is that kind of guilded leather with which they use to imbroyder their <hi>Irish</hi> Iac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets. And there likewise by all that description, you may see the very fashion and manner of the <hi>Irish</hi> horseman most truely set forth in his long hose, his ryding shooes of costly Cordwaine, his hacqueton, &amp; his haberion, with all the rest thereunto belonging.</p>

                     <p>I surely thought that the manner had beene <hi>Irish,</hi> for it is farre differing from that we have now, as also all the furniture of his horse, his strong brasse bit, his slyding reynes, his shanke pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion without stirruppes, his manner of mounting, his fashion of ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, his charging of his speare aloft above head, the forme of his speare.</p>

And therefore the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18659:222"/>
stirrup was called so in scorne, as it were a stay to get up, being derived of the olde <hi>English</hi> word <hi>Sty,</hi> which is, to get up, or mounte.</p>

                     <p>I doe not wish it to be laide away; but the abuse thereof to be put away; for being used to the end that it was framed, that is, to be worne in warre under a shirt of Mayle, it is allowable, as also the shirt of Mayle, and all his other furniture: but to be worne daylie at home, and in townes and civile places, it is a rude habite and most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely, seeming like a players painted coate.</p>

                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>Me thinkes, all this which you speake of, concerneth the customes of the <hi>Irish</hi> very materially, for their uses in warre are of no small importance to bee considered, aswell to reforme those which are evill, as to confirme and continue those which are good. But fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you your owne course, and shew what other their customes you have to dislike of.</p>

                     <p>There is amongst the <hi>Irish</hi> a certaine kind of people, called <hi>Bardes,</hi> which are to them in steed of <hi>Poets,</hi> whose profession is to set foorth the praises or dispraises of men in their <hi>Poems</hi> or <hi>Rymes,</hi> the which are had in so high regard and estimation amongst them, that none dare displease them for feare to runne into reproach tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough their offence, and to bee made infamous in the mouthes of all men. For their verses are taken up with a generall applause, and usually sung at all Feasts and meetings, by certaine other persons, whose proper function that is, who also receive for the same, great rewards and reputation amongst them.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>Doe you blame this in them which I would otherwise have thought to have beene worthy of good accompt, and rather to have beene maintained and augmented amongst them, then to have beene disliked, for I have reade that in all ages, <hi>Poets</hi> have beene had in speciall reputation, and that (mee thinkes) not without great cause; for besides their sweete inventions, and most wittie laies, they have alwayes used to set foorth the praises of the good and vertuous, and to beate downe and disgrace the bad and vitious. So that many brave yong mindes, have oftentimes thorough hearing the praises and famous <hi>Eulogies</hi> of worthie men sung and reported unto them, beene stirred up to affect the like commendations, and so to strive to the like deserts. So they say that the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> were more excited to desire of honour, with the excellent verses of the <hi>Poet Tirtaeus,</hi> then with all the exhortations of their Captaines, or authority of their Rulers and Magistrates.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>It is most true, that such <hi>Poets</hi> as in their writings doe labour to better the manners of men, and thorough the sweete baite of their numbers, to steale into the young Spirits a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of honour and vertue, are worthy to bee had in great respect.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:18659:223"/>
But these <hi>Irish</hi> Bardes are for the most part of another minde, and so farre from instructing yong men in morall discipline, that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves doe more deserve to bee sharpely disciplined, for they sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome use to choose unto themselves the doings of good men for the Arguments of their <hi>Poems,</hi> but whomsoever they finde to be most licentious of life, most bolde and lawlesse in his doings, most dangerous and desperate in all parts of disobedience and rebellious disposition, him they set up and glorifie in their Rithmes, him they praise to the people, &amp; to yong men make an example to follow</p>

                     <p>I marvaile what kinde of speeches they can finde, or what face they can put on, to praise such bad persons as live so lawleslie and licentiouslie upon stealthes and spoyles, as most of them doe, or how can they thinke that any good mind will applaude or approve the same.</p>

                     <p>There is none so bad <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> but shall finde some to favour his doings, but such licentious partes as these, tending for the most part to the hurt of the <hi>English,</hi> or maintenance of their owne lewde libertie, they themselves being most desirous therof, doe most allow. Besides this, evill things being decked and attired with the gay attire of goodly words, may easily deceive, &amp; carry away the affection of a yong mind, that is not well stayed, but desirous by some bolde ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, to make proofe of himselfe, for being (as they all be broght up) idlely, without awe of Parents, without precepts of masters, and without feare of offence, not being directed, nor imployed in any course of life, which may carry them to vertue, will easily be drawne to follow such as any shall set before them, for a yong minde cannot rest, if he be not still busied in some goodnesse, he will finde himselfe such businesse, as shall soone busie all about him. In which, if he shall find any to praise him, &amp; to give him encouragement, as those Bardes and Rythmers doe for little reward, or a share of a stolne Cow, then waxeth he most insolent and halfe madde with the love of himselfe, &amp; his owne lewd deeds. And as for words to set forth such lewdnes, it is not hard for them to give a goodly and painted shew thereunto, borrowed even from the praises which are proper to vertue it selfe. As of a most notorious thiefe &amp; wicked out-law, which had lived all his life-time of spoyles &amp; robberies, one of their Bardes in his praise will say, that he was none of the idle milke-sops that was brought up by the fire side, but that most of his dayes he spent in armes &amp; valiant enterprises, that he did never eat his meat, before he had won it with his sword, that he lay not all night slugging in a cabbin under his mantle, but used commonly to keepe others waking to defend their lives, and did light his candle at the flames of their houses, to leade him in the darkenesse: That the Day was his Night, and the Night his Day, that he loved not to be long woing of wenches to yeeld to him, but where he came, he tooke by force the spoyle of other mens love, and left but lamentation to their lovers; that his musick was not the harpe, nor layes of love, but the cryes of people, and clashing of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18659:223"/>
Armor: &amp; finally, that he died not bewayled of many, but made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waile when he died, that dearely bought his death. Doe you not thinke (<hi>Eudoxus</hi>) that many of these praises might be applyed to men of best deserts, yet are they all yeelded to a most notable Traytor, &amp; amongst some of the <hi>Irish</hi> not smally accounted of. For the song, when it was first made and sung to a person of high degree there, was bought (as their manner is) for forty crownes.</p>

                     <p>And well worthy sure. But tell me (I pray you) have they any Art in their compositions? or bee they any thing wittie or well favoured as Poemes should be?</p>

                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>Yea truely, I have caused divers of them to be translated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, that I might understand them, &amp; surely they savoured of sweet wit and good invention, but skilled not of the goodly ornaments of Poetry: yet were they sprinkled with some pretty flowres of their naturall device, which gave good grace &amp; comlinesse unto them, the which it is great pitty to see so abused; to the gracing of wickednes &amp; vice, which with good usage would serve to adorne &amp; beautifie ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. This evill custome therfore needeth reformation. And now next after the <hi>Irish Kerne,</hi> me thinks the <hi>Irish</hi> hors-boyes would come well in order, the use of which, though necessity (as times now be) do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force; yet in the thorough reformation of that Realme they should be cut off. For the cause why they are now to be permitted, is want of convenient Innes for lodging of travailers on horsback, &amp; of hostlers to tend their horses by the way. But when things shalbe reduced to a better passe, this needeth specially to be reformed. For out of the fry of these rake-hell horse-boyes, growing up in knavery and villainy, are their <hi>Kerne</hi> continually supplyed &amp; maintained. For having been once brought up an idle horse-boy, he will never after fall to labour, but is only made fit for the halter. And these also (the which is one foule over-sight) are for the most part bred up amongst the <hi>English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> of whom learning to shoote in a piece, and being made acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all the trades of the <hi>English,</hi> they are afterwards when they become <hi>Kerne,</hi> made more fit to cut their throats. Next to this, there is another much like; but much more lewde and dishonest, and that is, of their <hi>Carrows,</hi> which is a kinde of people that wander up and downe to Gentle-mens houses, living onely upon Cardes and Dice, the which, though they have little or nothing of their owne, yet will they play for much money, which if they winne, they waste most lightly, and if they lose, they pay as slenderly, but make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence with one stealth or another, whose onely hurt is not that they themselves are idle Lossells, but that thorough gaming, they draw others to like lewdnesse and idlenesse. And to these may bee added another sort of like loose fellowes, which doe passe up and downe amongst Gentlemen, by the name of Iesters, but are (indeed) notable rogues, &amp; partakers not onely of many stealthes, by setting forth other mens goods to be stolne, but also privy to many traitrous practices, and common carryers of newes, with desire whereof you
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18659:224"/>
would wonder how much the <hi>Irish</hi> are fed, for they use commonly to send up and downe to know newes, and if any meet with another, his second word is, what newes? Insomuch that hereof is tolde a prettie jest of a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> who having beene sometimes in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where he marked their great inquirie for newes, and meeting after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in <hi>France</hi> an <hi>Irishman,</hi> whom hee knew in <hi>Ireland,</hi> first saluted him, and afterwards said thus merrily: O Sir, I pray you tell me of curtesie, have you heard any thing of the newes, that you so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for in your Countrey?</p>

                     <p>There is a great use amongst the <hi>Irish,</hi> to make great assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies together upon a rath or hill, there to parlie (as they say) about matters and wrongs betweene Township &amp; Township, or one privat person and another. But well I wot, and true it hath beene oftentimes proved, that in their meetings many mischiefes have beene both pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised &amp; wrought; for to them doe commonly resort all the scumme of the people, where they may meete and conferre of what they list, which else they could not doe without suspition, or knowledge of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Besides at these meetings I have knowne divers times, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Englishmen,</hi> &amp; good <hi>Irish</hi> subjects, have bin villainously murdered by moving one quarell or another against them. For the <hi>Irish</hi> neuer come to those Raths, but armed, whether on horse or on foot, which the <hi>English</hi> nothing suspecting, are then commonly taken at advantage like sheep in the pin-folde.</p>

But these round hills and square Bawnes which you see so strongly trenched and throwne up, were (they say) at first ordained for the same purpose, that people might assemble themselves therein, and therefore aunciently they were called <hi>Talk-motes,</hi> that is, a place of people, to meete or talke of any thing that concerned any difference betweene parties and Towneships, which seemeth yet to me very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite.</p>

                        <hi>Saxons</hi> (in <hi>England</hi>) used this for their safety, they made those small round hills, so strongly fenced, in every quarter of the hundred, to the end that if in the night, or any other time, any troublous cry or uproare should happen, they might repaire with all speed unto their owne fort, which was appointed for their quarter, and there remaine safe, till they could assemble themselves in greater strength, for they were made so strong with one small entrance, that whosoever came thither first, were he one or two, or like few, he or they might there rest safe, and defend themselves against many, till more succour came unto them: and when they were gathered to a sufficient number, they marched to the next fort, and so forward till they met with the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill, or knew the occasions thereof. But besides these two sorts of hills, there were anciently divers others, for some were raised, where there had been a great battle fought, as a memory or Trophie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, others, as monuments of burialls, of the carcasses of all those that were slaine in any field, upon whom they did throwe such round mounts, as memorialls of them, and sometimes did cast up great heapes of stones, (as you may read the like in many places of the Scripture) and other whiles, they did throw up many round heapes of earth in a circle, like a garland, or pitch many long stones on end in compasse, every of which (they say) betokened some person of Note, there slaine and buried, for this was their auncient custome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christianity came in amongst them, that Church-yards were inclosed.</p>

                     <p>Cesse is none other then that which your selfe called impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, but it is in a kinde unacquainted perhaps unto you. For there are Cesses of sundry sorts, one is the cessing of Souldiours upon the Countrey: For <hi>Ireland</hi> being a Countrey of warre (as it is handled) and allwayes full of Souldiours, they which have the government, whether they finde it the most ease to the <hi>Queenes</hi> purse, or the most ready meanes at hand, for victualing of the Souldiour, or that neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity inforceth them thereunto, doe scatter the Army abroad in the Countrey, and place them in Villages to take their victuals of them, at such vacant times as they lye not in Campe, nor are otherwise im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in service. Another kinde of Cesse, is the imposing of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; for the Governors house-keeping, which though it be most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, and be also (for avoyding of all the evills formerly therein used) lately brought to a composition, yet it is not without great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, no lesse then here in <hi>England,</hi> or rather much more. The like Cesse is also charged upon the Countrey sometimes for victual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Souldiours, when they lye in Garrison, at such times as there is none remayning in the <hi>Queenes</hi> store, or that the same cannot be conveniently conveyed to their place of Garrison: But these two are not easily to be redressed when necessity thereto compelleth, but as for the former, as it is not necessary, so is it most hurtfull and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive to the poore country, and nothing convenient for the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours themselves, who during their lying at Cesse, use all kinde of outragious disorder and villany, both towards the poore men, which victuall and lodge them, as also to all the Country round about them, whom they abuse, oppresse, spoyle, &amp; afflict by all the meanes they can invent, for they will not onely, not content themselves with such victuals as their hostes, nor yet as the place, perhaps affords, but they will have other meate provided for them, and <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> sent for, yea and money besides laide at their trenchers, which if they want, then about the house they walke with the wretched poore man and his silly wife, who are glad to purchase their peace with any thing. By which vile manner of abuse, the countrey people, yea and the very <hi>English</hi> which dwell abroad and see, and sometimes feele
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:18659:225"/>
this outrage, growe into great detestation of the Souldiours, and thereby into hatred of the very government, which draweth upon them such evills: And therefore this you may also ioyne unto the former evill customes, which we have to reprove in <hi>Ireland.</hi>

                     <p>Truly this is one not the least, and though the persons by whom it is used, be of better note then the former roguish sort, which you reckoned, yet the fault (me thinkes) is no lesse worthy of a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall.</p>

                     <p>That were a harder course <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> to redresse every abuse by a marshall, it would seeme to you very evill surgery to cut off e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very unsound or sicke part of the body, which being by other due meanes recovered, might afterwards doe very good service to the body againe, and haply helpe to save the whole: Therefore I thinke better that some good salve for the redresse of the evill bee sought forth, then the least part suffered to perish: but hereof wee have to speake in another place. Now we will proceede to other like defects, amongst which there is one generall inconvenience, which raigneth almost throughout all <hi>Ireland</hi>: that is, the Lords of land and free-hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, doe not there use to set out their land in farme, or for tearme of yeares, to their Tennants, but onely from yeare to yeare, and some during pleasure, neither indeede will the <hi>Irish</hi> Tennant or husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man otherwise take his land, then so long as he list himselfe. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hereof in the Tennant is, for that the Land-lords there, use most shamefully to racke their Tennants, laying upon them <hi>Coigny</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</hi> at pleasure, &amp; exacting of them (besides his Covenants) what he pleaseth. So that the poore husbandman either dare not binde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to him, for longer tearme, or thinketh by his continuall liberty of change, to keepe his Land-lord the rather in awe from wronging of him. And the reason why the Land-lord will no longer covenant with him, is, for that he dayly looketh after change and alteration, and hovereth in expectation of new worlds.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>But what evill commeth hereby to the Common-wealth or what reason is it that any Land-lord should not set, nor any Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant take his land, as himselfe list?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>Marry the evils which commeth hereby is great, for by this meanes, both the Land-lord thinketh that he hath his Tennant more at commaund, to follow him into what action soever hee shall enter, and also the Tennant being left at his liberty is fit for every occasion of change that shall be offered by time: and so much also the more ready and willing is he to runne into the same, for that hee hath no such state in any his houlding, no such building upon any farme, no such coste imployed in fensing or husbanding the same, as might with-hold him from any such willfull course, as his Lords cause, or his owne lewde disposition may carry him unto. All which hee hath forborne, and spared so much expence, for that he had no firme estate in his Tenement, but was onely a Tennant at will or little more, and so at will may leave it. And this inconvenience may be reason enough
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18659:226"/>
to ground any ordinance for the good of the Common-wealth, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the private behoofe or will of any Landlord that shall refuse to graunt any such terme or estate unto his Tennant, as may tende to the good of the whole Realme.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>Indeede (me thinkes) it is a great willfullnes in any such Land-lord to refuse to make any longer farmes unto their Tennants, as may, besides the generall good of the Realme, be also greatly for their owne profit and availe: For what reasonable man will not thinke that the Tenement shalbe made much better for the Lords behoofe, if the Tennant may by such good meanes bee drawne to build him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe some handsome habitation thereon, to ditch and inclose his ground, to manure and husband it as good Farmours use. For when his Tennants terme shalbe expired: it will yeeld him in the renewing his lease, both a good fine, and also a better rent. And also it shall be for the good of the Tennant likewise, who by such buildings and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closures shall receive many benefits: first by the handsomenesse of his house, he shall take more comfort of his life, more safe dwelling, and a delight to keepe his said house neate and cleanely, which now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they commonly are, rather swyne-styes, then houses; is the cheifest cause of his so beastly manner of life, and savage condition, lying and living together with his beast in one house, in one roome, in one bed, that is, cleane strawe, or rather a foule dunghill. And to all these other commodities, hee shall in sort time finde a greater added, that is his owne wealth and riches increased, and wonderfully inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, by keeping his Cattle in inclosures, where they shall allwayes have fresh pasture, that now is all trampled and over-runne, warme covert, that now lyeth open to all weather, safe being, that now are continually filched and stolne.</p>

                     <p>You have <hi>Eudoxus</hi> well accompted the commodities of this one good ordinance, amongst which, this that you named last is not the least, for all the other being most beneficiall to the Land-lord and Tennant. This cheifly redoundeth to the good of the Common-wealth, to have the land thus inclosed, and well fenced. For it is both a principall barre and impeachment unto theeves from stealing of cattle in the night, and also a gaule against all Rebels, and Outlawes, that shall rise up in any numbers against the governement, for the theife thereby shall have much adoe, first to bring forth, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to drive away his stolne prey, but thorough the common high wayes, where he shall soone bee descryed and met withall: And the Rebell or open enemy, if any such shall happen, either at home, or from abroad, shall easily be found when he commeth forth, and also be well incountred withall by a few, in so straight passages and strong inclosures. This therefore when wee come to the reforming of all those evill customes before mentioned, is needefull to be remembred but now by this time (me thinkes) that I have well run thorough the evill uses which I have observed in <hi>Ireland.</hi> Neverthelesse I well note that there be many more, and infinitely many more in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:18659:226"/>
abuses of men. But these that are most generall, and tending to the hurt of the Common-weale, (as they have come to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance) I have as breifly as I could rehearsed unto you. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now I thinke best that we passe unto our third part, in which we noted inconveniences that are in Religion.</p>

                     <p>Then belike it is meete that some fitter time be attended, that God send peace and quietnesse there in civill matters, before it be attempted in Ecclesiasticall.

                     <p>Most true <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> the care of the soule, and soule matters is to be preferred, before the care of the body, in consideration of the worthynesse thereof, but not till the time of reformation, for if you should know a wicked person dangerously sicke, having now both soule and body greatly diseased, yet both recoverable, would you not thinke it evill advertizement to bring the Preacher before the Phisitian, for if his body were neglected, it is like that his languishing soule being disquieted by his diseasefull body, would utterly refuse

and loath all spirituall comfort, but if his body were first recured, &amp; broght to good frame, should there not then be found best time, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the soule also. So it is in the state of a Realme: Therefore (as I said) it is expedient, first to settle such a course of government there, as thereby both civill disorders, and ecclesiasticall abuses may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed and amended, whereto needeth not any such great distance of times, as (you suppose) I require, but one joynt resolution for both, that each might second and confirme the other.</p>

                     <p>I think it is well observed, and that none of the Bishops trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse the same, but yet it worketh no reformation thereof, for many defects. First there are no such sufficient <hi>English</hi> Ministers sent over as might be presented to an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, the Bishop himselfe is perhappes an <hi>Irish</hi> man, who being made Iudge by that Law, of the sufficiencie of the Ministers, may at his owne will, dislike of the <hi>Englishman,</hi> as unworthy in his opinion, and admit of any <hi>Irish,</hi> whom hee shall thinke more for his turne. And if hee shall at the instance of any <hi>Englishman</hi> of countenance there, whom hee will not displease, accept of any such <hi>English</hi> Minister as shall bee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>endered unto him, yet hee will under hand, carry such a hard hand over him, or by his Officers wring him so sore, that hee will soone make him weary of his poore living. Lastly, the Benefices themselves are so meane, and of so small profite in those <hi>Irish</hi> Countreyes, thorough the ill husbandrie of the <hi>Irish</hi> people which doe inhabite them, that they will not yeelde any competent maintainance for any honest Minister to live upon, scarcely to buy him a gowne. And were all this redressed (as happily it might bee) yet what good should any <hi>English</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster doe amongst them, by teaching or preaching to them, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cannot understand him, or will not heare him? Or what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of life shall he have, where his Parishioners are so insatiable, so intractable, so ill affected to him, as they usuall bee to all the <hi>English</hi>; or finally, how dare almost any honest Minister, that are peaceable civile men, commit his safetie to the handes of such Neighbours, as the boldest Captaines dare scarcely dwell by?</p>

But there is one very foule abuse, which by the way I may not omit, and that is in Captaines, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that they are specially imployed to make peace thorough strong execution of warre, yet they doe so dandle their doings, &amp; dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in the service to them committed, as if they would not have the enemy subdued, or utterly beaten downe, for feare lest afterwardes they should need imployment, &amp; so be discharged of pay: For which cause some of them that are layde in garrison, doe so handle the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that they will doe no great hurt to the enemyes, yet for colour sake, some men they will kill, even halfe with the consent of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, being persons either of base regard, or enemies to the enemy, whose heads eftsoones they send to the Governor for a commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their great indevour, telling how weighty a service they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, by cutting off such and such dangerous Rebells.</p>

                     <p>To you onely <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> I doe tell it, and that even with great hearts griefe, and inward trouble of mind to see her Majestie so much abused by some who are put in speciall trust of those great affaires: Of which, some being martiall men, will not doe alwayes what they may for quieting of things, but will rather winke at some faults, and suffer them unpunished, lest they (having put all things in that assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of peace that they might) they should seeme afterwards not to be needed, nor continued in their governments with so great a charge to her Maiestie. And therefore they doe cunningly carry their course of government, and from one hand to another doe bandie the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice like a Tennis-Ball, which they will never strike quite away, for feare lest afterwards they should want.</p>

                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>I doe speake of no particulars, but the truth may be found out by tryall and reasonable insight into some of their doings. And if I should say, there is some blame thereof in the principall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, I thinke I might also shew some reasonable proofe of my speech. As for example, some of them seeing the end of their government to draw nigh, and some mischiefes and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blous practice growing up, which afterwardes may worke trouble to the next succeeding Governour, will not attempt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse or cutting off thereof, either for feare they should leave the Realme unquiet at the end of their government, or that the next that commeth, should receive the same too quiet, and so happily winne more prayse thereof, then they before. And therefore they will not (as I said) seeke at all to represse that evill, but will either by graunting protection for a time, or holding some empar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance with the Rebell, or by treatie of Commissioners, or by other like devices, onely smother and keepe downe the flame of the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe, so as it may not breake out in their time of government, what comes afterwards they care not, or rather wish the worst. This course hath beene noted in some Governors.</p>

                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>Surely (<hi>Irenaeus</hi>) This if it were true, should bee worthy of an heavy iudgment: But it is hardly to bee thought, that any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour should so much either envie the good of that Realme which is put into his hand, or defraude her Maiestie who trusteth him so much, or maligne his successour which shall possesse his place, as to suffer an evill to grow up, which he might timely have kept under, or perhaps to nourish it with coloured countenance, or such sinister meanes.</p>

                     <p>I doe not certainely avouch so much (<hi>Eudoxus</hi>) but the sequele of things doth in a manner proove, and plainly speake so much, that the Governours usually are envious one of anothers greater glory, which if they would seeke to excell by better gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, it should bee a most laudable emulation. But they doe quite
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:18659:229"/>
otherwise. For this (as you may marke) is the common order of them, that who commeth next in place, will not follow that course of government, how ever good, which his predecessors held, either for disdaine of himselfe, or doubt to have his doings drowned in an other mans praise, but will straight take a way quite contrary to the former: As if the former thought (by keeping under the <hi>Irish</hi>) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them: the next by discountenancing the <hi>English,</hi> will curry favour with the <hi>Irish,</hi> and so make his government seeme plausible, as having all the <hi>Irish</hi> at his commaund: But he that comes after, will perhappes follow neither the one nor the other, but will dandle the the one and the other in such sort, as hee will sucke sweete out of them both, and leave bitternesse to the poore Countrey, which if he that comes after shall seeke to redresse, he shall perhappes finde such crosses, as hee shall hardly bee able to beare, or doe any good that might worke the disgrace of his predecessors.

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18659:229"/>
other meanes will be but as lost labour, by patching up one hole to make many, for the <hi>Irish</hi> doe strongly hate and abhorre all reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and subjection to the <hi>English,</hi> by reason that having beene once subdued by them, they were thrust out of all their possessions.

To which there now little wanteth, for I thinke the word be already given, and there wanteth nothing but oportunitie, which truely is the death of one noble person, who being himselfe most stedfast to his soveraigne Queene, and his Countrey, coasting u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the South Sea, stoppeth the ingate of all that evill which is looked for, and holdeth in all those which are at his becke, with the terrour of his greatnesse, and the assurance of his most immoveable loyaltie: And therefore where you thinke, that good and sound lawes might amend, and reforme things there amisse; you think sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amisse. For it is vaine to prescribe Lawes, where no man ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for keeping of them, nor feareth the daunger for breaking of them. But all the Realme is first to be reformed, and lawes are after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to bee made for keeping and continuing it in that reformed estate.</p>

                     <p>It is so, but where no other remedie may bee devised, nor hope of recovery had, there must needes this violent meanes bee used.

                     <p>There is surely great, when you shall understand it, for by the sword which I named, I did not meane the cutting off all that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the sword, which farre bee it from mee, that I should ever thinke so desperately, or wish so uncharitably, but by the Sword I meane the royall power of the Prince, which ought to stretch it selfe forth in the chiefest strength to the redressing and cutting off those evills, which I before blamed, and not of the people which are evill. For evill people, by good ordinances and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may be made good; but the evill that is of it selfe evill, will never become good.</p>

                     <p>The first thing must be to send over into that Realme, such a strong power of men, as should perforce bring in all that rebellious route and loose people, which either doe now stand out in open Armes, or in wandring companies doe keepe the woods, spoyling the good subjects.</p>

                     <p>You speake now <hi>Irenaeus</hi> of an infinite charge to her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie, to send over such an Army, as should tread downe all that stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth before them on foot, and lay on the ground all the stiff-necked people of that land, for there is now but one Out-law of any great reckoning, to wit, the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Tyrone</hi> abroad in armes, against whom you see what huge charges shee hath beene at this last yeare, in sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of men, providing of victualls, and making head against him, yet there is little or nothing at all done, but the Queenes treasure spent, her people wasted, the poore Countrey troubled, and the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my neverthelesse brought into no more subjection then he was, or list outwardly to shew, which in effect is none, but rather a scorne of her power, and emboldening of a proud rebell, and an incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to all like lewdlie disposed Traytors, that shall dare to
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:18659:230"/>
lift up their heele, against their soveraigne Lady: Therefore it were hard counsell to drawe such an exceeding great charge upon her, whose event should be so uncertaine.</p>

                  <sp>

                     <p>True indeede, if the event should bee uncertaine, but the certainty of the effect hereof shall be so infallible, as that no reason can gainesay it, neither shall the charge of all this Army (the which I demaund) be much greater, then so much as in these last two yeares warres, hath vainely beene expended. For I dare undertake, that it hath coste the Queene above 200000. pounds already, and for the present charge, that she is now at there, amounteth to very neere 12000. pounds a moneth, whereof cast you the accompt: yet nothing is done. The which summe had it beene imployed as it should bee, would have effected all this which now I goe about.</p>

                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>How meane you to have it imployed? but to bee spent in the pay of Souldiours, and provision of victualls.</p>

                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>Right so, but it is now not disbursed at once, as it might be, but drawne out into a long length, by sending over now 20000 pounds, and next halfe yeare 10000. pounds, so as the Souldiour in the meane time for want of due provision of victuall, and good pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his due, is starved and consumed, that of a 1000. which came over lusty able men, in halfe a yeare there are not left 500. And yet is the Queenes charge never a whit the lesse, but what is not payd in present money, is accounted in debt, which will not be long unpayd, for the Captaine, halfe of whose Souldiours are dead, and the other quarter never mustered, nor seene, comes shortly to demand payment of his whole accompt, where by good meanes of some great ones, and privy shareings with the Officers and servants of other some, hee receiveth his debt, much lesse perhaps then was due, yet much more indeede then he justly deserved.</p>

                     <p>I take this sure to be no good husbandry, for what must needes be spent, as good spend it at once, where is enough, as to have it drawne out into long delayes, seeing that thereby both the service is much hindred, and yet nothing saved but it may be <hi>Irenaeus</hi> that the Queenes treasure in so great occasions of disbursements (as it is well knowne she hath beene at lately,) is not alwayes so ready, nor so plentifull, as it can spare so great a summe together, but being payed as it is, now some, and then some, it is no great burthen unto her, nor any great impoverishment to her Coffers, seeing by such delay of time, it daylie commeth in, as fast as she parteth it out.</p>

                     <p>It may be as you say, but for the going thorough of so ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable a course (I doubt not) but if the Queenes Coffers be not so well stored (which we are not to looke into) but that the whole Realme which now as things are used, doe feele a continuall burthen of that wretched Realme, hanging upon their backes, would for a small riddance of all that trouble, be once troubled for all: and put to all their shoulders, and helping hands, and hearts also, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraying of that charge, most gladfully and willingly, and surely the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:18659:231"/>
charge in effect, is nothing to the infinite great good, which should come thereby, both to the Queene, and all this Realme generally, as when time serveth shall be shewed.</p>

                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>Verily not above 10000. footemen, and a 1000. horse, and all these not above the space of a yeare and a halfe, for I would still as the heate of the service abateth, abate the number in pay, and make other provision for them, as I will shew.</p>

                     <p>Surely it seemeth not much which you require, nor no long time, but how would you have them used? would you leade forth your Army against the Enemy, and seeke him where he is, to fight?</p>

                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>No <hi>Eudoxus</hi>; That would not be, for it is well knowne that he is a flying enemie, hiding himselfe in woodes and bogges, from whence he will not drawe forth, but into some straight passage or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous foord, where he knowes the Army must needes passe: There will he lye in waite, and if hee finde advantage fit, will dangerously hazard the troubled Souldiour. Therefore to seeke him out that still flitteth, and follow him that can hardly bee found, were vaine and bootelesse, but I would devide my men in garrison upon his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, in such places as I should thinke might most annoy him.</p>

                     <p>But how can that be <hi>Irenaeus</hi> with so few men? for the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie as you now see, is not all in one Country, but some in <hi>Vlster,</hi> some in <hi>Connaght,</hi> and others in <hi>Leinster.</hi> So as to plant strong garrisons in all those places should neede many more men then you speake of, or to plant all in one, and to leave the rest naked, should be but to leave them to the spoyle.</p>

                     <p>I would wish the cheife power of the Army to be garrisond in one Countrey that is strongest, and the other upon the rest that is weakest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As for example, the Earle of <hi>Tyrone</hi> is now accompted the strongest, upon him would I lay 8000. men in garrison, 1000. upon <hi>Pheagh Mac Hugh</hi> and the <hi>Cavanaghes,</hi> and 1000. upon some parts of <hi>Connaght,</hi> to be at the direction of the Governour.</p>

                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>I see now all your men bestowed, but what places would you set their garrison that they might rise out most conveniently to service? and though perhaps I am ignorant of the places, yet I will take the <hi>Mappe</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and lay it before me, and make mine eyes (in the meane time) my Schoole-masters, to guide my understanding to judge of your plot.</p>

                     <p>Those eight thousand in <hi>Vlster,</hi> I would devide likewise into foure parts, so as there should be 2000. Footemen in every garrison: The which I would thus place. Vpon the <hi>Blacke water,</hi> in some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient place, as high upon the River as might be, I would lay one garrison. Another would I put at <hi>Castle-liffer,</hi> or there-abouts, so as they should have all the passages upon the River to <hi>Logh-foyle.</hi> The
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18659:231"/>
third I would place about <hi>Fermanagh</hi> or <hi>Bundroise,</hi> so as they might lye betweene <hi>Connaght</hi> and <hi>Vlster,</hi> to serve upon both sides, as occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall be offered, and this therefore would I have stronger then any of the rest, because it should be most inforced, and most imployed, and that they might put wardes at <hi>Balli-shanon,</hi> and <hi>Belick,</hi> and all those passages. The last would I set about <hi>Monoghan</hi> or <hi>Balturbut,</hi> so as it should fronte both upon the Enemie that way, and also keepe the Countyes of <hi>Cavan</hi> and <hi>Meath</hi> in awe, from passage of straglers from those parts, whence they use to come forth, and oftentimes use to worke much mischeife<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And to every of these garrisons of 2000. Footemen, I would have 200. horsemen added, for the one without the other, can doe but little service. The 4. Garrisons thus being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, I would have to bee victualled before hand for halfe a yeare, which you will say to be hard, considering the corruption and usuall waste of victualls. But why should not they be aswell victualled for so long time, as the ships are usually for a yeare, and sometimes two, seeing it is easier to keepe victuall on land then water. Their bread I would have in flower, so as it might be baked still to serve their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary want. Their Beere there also brewed within them, from time to time, and their Beefe before hand barelled, the which may bee used, but as it is needed: For I make no doubt but fresh victualls, they will sometimes purvay for themselves, amongst their Enemies. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto likewise would I have them, have a store of hose and shooes, with such other necessaries as may be needefull for Souldiours, so as they should have no occasion to looke for releife from abroad, or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of such trouble, for their continuall supply, as I see and have often proved in <hi>Ireland</hi> to bee more cumberous to the Deputy, and dangerous to them that releive them, then halfe the leading of an Army; for the Enemy knowing the ordinary wayes thorough the which their releife must be brought them, useth commonly to draw himselfe into the straight passages thither-ward, and oftentimes doth dangerously distresse them, besides the pay of such force as should be sent for their convoy, the charge of the carriages, the exactions of the Countrey shall be spared. But onely every halfe yeare the supply brought by the Deputy himselfe, and his power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who shall then vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site and overlooke all those Garrisons, to see what is needefull to change, what is expedient, and to direct what hee shall best advise. And those 4. Garrisons issuing forth, at such convenient times as they shall have intelligence or espiall upon the enemy, will so drive him from one side to another, and Tennis him amongst them, that he shall finde no where safe to keepe his Creete in, nor hide himselfe, but fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the fire shall fall into the water, and out of one danger into another, that in short space his Creete, which is his cheife sustenance, shall be wasted with preying, or killed with driving, or starved for want of pasture in the woods, and he himselfe brought so lowe, that he shall have no heart nor ability, to indure his wretchednesse, the which will surely come to passe in very short time, for one Winter
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18659:232"/>
well followed upon him will so plucke him on his knees, that he will never be able to stand up againe.</p>

                     <p>I doe well understand your reason, but by your leave, I have heard it otherwise said, of some that were Outlawes: That in Summer they kept themselves quiet, but in Winter they would play their parts, and when the nights were longest, then burne and spoyle most, so that they might safely returne before day.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>I have likewise heard, and also seene proofe thereof true: But that was of such Outlawes as were either abiding in well inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Countryes, as in <hi>Mounster,</hi> or bordering on the <hi>English</hi> pale, as <hi>Feagh Mac Hugh,</hi> the <hi>Cavanaghes,</hi> the <hi>Moores,</hi> the <hi>Dempsies,</hi> or such like: For, for them the winter indeede is the fittest time for spoyling and robbing, because the nights are then (as you said) longest and darkest, and also the Countryes round about are then most full of Corne, and good provision to be gotten every where by them, but it is farre otherwise with a strong peopled enemy, that possesse a whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, for the other being but a few, and indeede privily lodged, and kept in out villages, and corners nigh to the woodes and mountaines, by some of their privy friends, to whom they bring their spoyles and stealthes, and of whom they continually receive secret releife: But the open enemy having all his Countrey wasted, what by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and what by the Souldiours, findeth then succour in no place: Townes there are none, of which hee may get spoyle, they are all burnt: bread he hath none, he ploweth not in Summer: Flesh he hath, but if he kill it in Winter, he shall want milke in Summer, and shortly want life. Therefore if they bee well followed, but one Winter, you shall have little worke with them the next Summer.</p>

By which
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:18659:232"/>
straight keeping of them in, and not suffering them at any time long to rest, I must needes thinke that they will soone bee brought lowe, and driven to great extreamities. All which when you have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and brought them to the very last cast, suppose that they will offer, either to come to you and submit themselves, or that some of them will seeke to withdraw themselves, what is your advice to doe, will you have them received?</p>

                     <p>No, but at the beginning of those warres, and when the Garrisons are well planted, and fortified, I would wish a Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were made generally, to come to their knowledge: That what persons soever, would within twenty dayes absolutely submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, (excepting onely the very Principalls and Ring-leaders) should finde grace: I doubt not, but upon the settling of these Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, such a terrour and neere consideration of their perillous state, would be strucken into most of them, that they will covet to drawe away from their Leaders. And againe I well know that the Rebells themselves (as I saw by proofe in <hi>Desmonds</hi> warres,) will turne away all their rascall people, whom they thinke unserviceable, as old men, women, children, and hyndes (which they call Churles,) which would onely waste their victualls, and yeeld them no ayde, but their Cattle they will surely keepe away: These therefore though policy would turne them backe againe, that they might the rather consume and afflict the other Rebells, yet in a pittyfull commiseration I would wish them to be received; The rather for that this sort of base people, doth not for the most part rebell of themselves, having no heart thereunto, but are by force drawne by the grand Rebells into their action, and carryed away with the violence of the streame, else they should be sure to loose all that they have, and perhaps their lives too: The which they now carry unto them, in hope to enjoy them there, but they are there by the strong Rebells themselves, soone turned out of all, so that the constrainte hereof, may in them deserve pardon. Likewise if any of their able men or Gentlemen shall then offer to come away, and to bring their Cattle with them, as some no doubt may steale them away privily, I wish them also to be received, for the disabling of the enemy, but withall, that good assurance may be taken for their true behaviour and absolute submission, and that then they be not suffered to remaine any longer in those parts, no nor about the Garrisons, but sent away into the inner parts of the Realme, and dispersed in such sort as they may not come together, nor easily returne if they would: For if they might bee suffered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine about the Garrisons, and there inhabite, as they will offer to tille the ground, and yeeld a great part of the profit thereof, and of their Cattle, to the <hi>Coronell,</hi> wherewith they have heretofore tempted many, they would (as I have by experience knowne) bee ever after such a gaule, and inconvenience to them, as that their profit shall not recompence their hurt, for they will privily releive their friends that are forth, they will send the Enemy secret advertizements of all their
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18659:233"/>
purposes and journeyes, which they meane to make upon them, they will not also sticke to drawe the enemy privily upon them, yea and to betray the fort it selfe, by discovery of all her defects and disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages (if any be) to the cutting of all their throates. For avoiding whereof and many other inconveniences, I wish that they should be carried farre from thence into some other parts, so that (as I say) they come in and submit themselves, upon the first summons: But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards I would have none received but left to their fortune and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable end: my reason is, for that those which will afterwards remaine without, are stout and obstinate Rebells, such as will never be made dutifull and obedient, nor brought to labour or civill conversation, having once tasted that licentious life, and being acquainted with spoyle and out-rages, will ever after be ready for the like occasions, so as there is no hope of their amendment or recovery, and therefore needefull to be cut off.</p>

                     <p>The end will (I assure me) bee very short and much sooner then can be in so great a trouble, as it seemeth hoped for, although there should none of them fall by the sword, nor bee slaine by the Souldiour, yet thus being kept from manurance, and their Cattle from running abroad, by this hard restraint they would quickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume themselves, and devoure one another. The proofe whereof, I saw sufficiently exampled in these late warres of <hi>Mounster,</hi> for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that the same was a most rich and plentifull countrey, full of corne and cattle, that you would have thought they should have beene able to stand long, yet ere one yeare and a halfe they were brought to such wretchednesse, as that any stony heart would have rued the same. Out of every corner of the woods and glynnes they came creeping forth upon their hands, for their legges could not beare them, they looked like anatomies of death, they spake like Ghosts crying out of their graves, they did eate the dead Carrions, happy were they could finde them, yea, and one another soone after, insomuch as the very carcasses they spared not to scrape out of their graves, and if they found a plot of water-cresses or Shamrocks; there they flocked as to a feast for the time, yet not able long to continue therewithall, that in short space there were none almost left, and a most populous and plentifull countrey suddainely left voyde of man and beast, yet sure in all that warre, there perished not many by the Sword, but all by the extremitie of famine, which they themselves had wrought.</p>

But that the necessitie of that present state of things, inforced him to that violence, and almost changed his naturall disposition. But otherwise he was so farre from delighting in blood, that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he suffered not just vengeance to fall where it was deserved: and even some of them which were afterwardes his accusers, had tasted too much of his mercy, and were from the gallowes brought to bee his accusers.

                     <p>Both the one and the other is most untrue; for this I can assure you, my selfe being as neare them as any, that hee was so farre either from promising, or putting them in hope, that when first their Secretarie (called as I remember) <hi>Signior Ieffrey</hi> an <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> being sent to treate with the Lord Deputie for grace, was flatly refused: And afterwards their Coronell named <hi>Don Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> came forth to intreate that they might part with their Armes like Souldiers, at the least with their lives according to the custome of Warre, and Law of Nations, it was strongly denyed him, and tolde him by the Lord Deputie himselfe, that they could not iustly pleade either custome of Warre, or Law of Nations, for that they were not any lawfull Enemies, and if they were, hee willed them to shew by what commission they came thither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another Princes Dominions to warre, whether from the Pope or the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> or any other, the which when they said they had not, but were onely adventurers that came to seeke fortune a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and to serve in warres amongst the <hi>Irish,</hi> who desired to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine them. It was then tolde them, that the <hi>Irish</hi> themselves, as the <hi>Earle</hi> and <hi>Iohn of Desmond,</hi> with the rest, were no lawfull Enemies; but Rebells and Traytours, and therefore they that came to succour them, no better then Rogues and Runnagates, specially comming with no licence, nor commission from their owne King. So as it should bee dishonourable for him in the name of his Queene, to condition or make any tearmes with such Rascalls, but left them to their choyce, to yeeld and submit themselves, or no: whereupon the said Coronell did absolutely yeeld himselfe and the Fort, with all therein, and craved onely mercy, which it being not thought good to shew them, for daunger of them, if being saved, they should afterwardes ioyne with the <hi>Irish,</hi> and also for terrour to the <hi>Irish,</hi> who are much imboldened by those forraigne succours, and also put in hope of more ere long, there was no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way but to make that short end of them as was made.

                     <p>You say most true, for after that Lords calling away from thence, the two Lords Iustices continued but a while: of which the one was of minde (as it seemed) to have continued in the footing of his predecessors, but that he was curbed and restrayned. But the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was more mildly disposed, as was meete for his profession, and willing to have all the wounds of that Common-wealth healed and recured, but not with that heede as they should bee. After when Sir <hi>Iohn Perrot</hi> succeeding (as it were) into another mans harvest, found an open way to what course hee list, the which hee bent not to that point which the former Governours intended, but rather quite contrary, as it were in scorne of the former, and in vaine vaunt of his owne Councells, with the which hee was too willfully carryed; for hee did treade downe and disgrace all the <hi>English,</hi> and set up and countenance the <hi>Irish</hi> all that hee could, whether thinking thereby to make them more tractable and buxome to his government, (wherein hee thought much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse) or privily plotting some other purposes of his owne, as it partly afterwards appeared, but surely his manner of governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, could not be sound nor wholesome for that Realme, it being so contrary to the former. For it was even as two Physicians should take one sicke body in hand, at two sundry times: Of which the former would minister all things meete to purge and keepe under the Bodie: the other to pamper and strengthen it suddenly againe, whereof what is to bee looked for, but a most daungerous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapse? That which wee now see thorough his rule, and the next after him, happened thereunto, being now more daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously sicke then ever before. Therefore by all meanes it must bee fore-seene and assured, that after once entering into this course of reformation, there bee afterwardes no remorse nor drawing backe for the sight of any such ruefull objects, as must thereupon followe, nor for compassion of their cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, seeing that by no other meanes it is possible to cure them, and that these are not of will, but of very urgent neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie.</p>

                     <p>Thus farre then you have now proceeded to plant your garrisons, and to direct their services, of the which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthelesse I must needes conceive that there cannot be any certaine direction set downe, so that they must follow the occasions which shall bee daylie offered, and diligently awayted. But by your leave (<hi>Irenaeus</hi>) notwithstanding all this your carefull fore-sight and provision (mee thinkes) I see an evill lurke unespyed, and that may chance to hazard all the hope of this great service, if it bee not very well looked into, and that is, the corruption of their Captaines; for though they be placed never so carefully, and their Companies filled never so sufficiently, yet may they, if
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:18659:235"/>
they list, discarde whom they please, and send away such as will perhappes willingly bee ridde of that dangerous and hard service, the which (well I wote) is their common custome to doe, when they are layde in garrison, for then they may better hide their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults, then when they are in Campe, where they are continually eyed and noted of all men. Besides, when their pay commeth, they will (as they say) detaine the greatest portions thereof at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, by a hundred shifts that need not here be named, through which they oftentimes deceive the Souldier, and abuse the Queene, and greatly hinder the service. So that let the Queene pay never so fully, let the Muster-Master view then never so diligently, let the Deputy or Generall looke to them never so exactly, yet they can cozen them all. Therefore me thinkes it were good, if it be possible, to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for this inconvenience.</p>

                     <p>It will surely be very hard; but the chiefest helpe for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention hereof must be the care of the <hi>Coronell</hi> that hath the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all his garrison, to have an eye to their alterations, to know the numbers and names of the sick Souldiers, and the slaine, to marke and observe their rankes in their daylie rising forth to service, by which he cannot easily bee abused, so that hee himselfe bee a man of speciall assurance and integritie. And therefore great regard is to bee had in the choosing and appointing of them. Besides, I would not by any meanes, that the Captaines should have the paying of their Souldiers, but that there should bee a Pay-master appointed, of speciall trust, which should pay every man according to his Captaines Ticket, and the accompt of the Clerke of his Band, for by this meanes the Captaine will never seeke to falsifie his alterations, nor to diminish his Company, nor to deceive his Souldiers, when nothing thereof shalbe sure to come unto himselfe, but what is his owne bare pay. And this is the manner of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Captaine, who never hath to meddle with his Souldiers pay, and indeed scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the name as base to be counted his Souldiers <hi>Pagadore,</hi> whereas the contrary amongst us hath brought things to so bad a passe, that there is no Captaine but thinkes his Band very sufficient, if hee can muster 60: and stickes not to say openly, that he is unworthy to have a Captainship, that cannot make it worth 500<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. by the yeare, the which they right well verifie by the proofe.</p>

                     <p>Yea verily, but all these to bee limited with very straite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions. As first for protections, that hee shall have authority af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the first Proclamation, for the space of twentie dayes, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect all that shall come in, and them to send to the Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie, with their safe conduct or passe, to bee at his disposition,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:18659:236"/>
but so as none of them returne backe againe, being once come in, but be presently sent away out of the Countrey, to the next She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe, and so conveyed in safetie. And likewise for martiall Lawe, that to the Souldier it bee not extended, but by tryall formerly of his cryme, by a Iury of his fellow Souldiers as it ought to bee, and not rashly at the will or displeasure of the Coronell, as I have sometimes seene too lightly. And as for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Rebells that shall light into their handes, that they bee well aware of what condition they bee, and what holding they have. For in the last generall warres there, I knew ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good Free-holders executed by martiall law, whose landes were thereby saved to their Heires, which should have other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise escheated to her Majestie. In all which the great discretion and uprigntnesse of the Coronell himselfe is to bee the chiefest stay both for all those doubts, and for many other difficulties that may in the service happen.</p>

                     <p>No marrie, for there is no doubt, but hee will offer to come in, as hee hath done diverse times already, but it is without any intent of true submission, as the effect hath well shewed, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed can hee now if hee would, come in at all, nor give that assurance of himselfe that should bee meete: for being as hee is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry subtle headed, seeing himselfe now so farre ingaged in this bad action, can you thinke that by his submission, hee can purchase to himselfe any safetie, but that heereafter, when things shall bee quieted, these his villanies will be ever remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, and whensoever hee shall treade awry (as needes the most righteous must sometimes) advantage will bee taken thereof, as a breach of his pardon, and hee brought to a reckoning for all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer matters; besides, how hard it is now for him to frame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to subjection, that having once set before his Eyes the hope of a Kingdome, hath therunto not onely found incouragement from the greatest King in Christendome, but also found great faintnes in her Maiesties withstanding him, wherby he is animated to think that his power is able to defend him, &amp; offend further then he hath done, whensoever he please, let every reasonable man iudge. But if hee himselfe should come and leave all other, his accomplices without, as <hi>O Donel, Mac Mahone, Maguire,</hi> &amp; the rest, he must needs thinke that then even they, will ere long cut his throate, which having drawne them all into this occasion, now in the midst of their trouble giveth them the slip, whereby hee must needes perceive how impossible it is for him to submit himselfe. But yet if hee would so doe, can he give any good assurance of his obedience? For how weake

hould is there by hostages, hath too often beene proved, and that which is spoken of taking <hi>Shane O-Neales</hi> sonnes from him, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them up against him is a very perillous counsaile, and not by any meanes to be put in proofe, for were they let forth and could over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe him, who should afterwards overthrow them, or what assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance can be had of them? It will be like the tale in <hi>Aesop,</hi> of the wild horse, who having enmity with the Stagg, came to a man to desire his ayde against his foe, who yeelding therevnto mounted upon his backe, and so following the stagge, ere long slew him, but then when the horse would have him alight he refused, but ever after kept him in his subjection and service. Such I doubt would bee the proofe of <hi>Shane O-Neales</hi> sonnes. Therefore it is most dangerous to attempt any such plot, for even that very manner of plot, was the meanes by which this trayterous Earle is now made great: For when the last <hi>O-Neale,</hi> called <hi>Terlagh Leinagh,</hi> began to stand upon some tickle termes, this fellow then, called Baron of <hi>Dunganon,</hi> was set up as it were to beard him, and countenanced and strengthened by the Queene so far, as that he is now able to keepe her selfe play: much like unto a Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster that having lost all, borroweth of his next fellow-Gamester somewhat to maintaine play, which he setting unto him againe, short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thereby winneth all from the winner.</p>

                     <p>For the right of <hi>O-Neale</hi> in the seigniory of the north, it is surely none at all: For besides that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> conquered all the Realme, and thereby assumed and invested all the right of that land to themselves and their heires and successours for ever: So as nothing was left in <hi>O-Neale</hi> but what he received backe from them, <hi>O-Neale</hi> himselfe never had any ancient Seigniory over that country, but what by usurpation and incroachment after the death of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Clarence,</hi> he got upon the <hi>English,</hi> whose lands and possessions being formerly wasted by the <hi>Scottes,</hi> under the leading of <hi>Edward le Bruce,</hi> (as I formerly declared unto you) he eft-soones entred into, and sithence hath wrongfully detained, through the other occupations and great affaires which the Kings of <hi>England</hi> (soone after) fell into here at home, so as they could not intend to the recovery of that Countrey of the north, nor restraine the insolency of <hi>O-Neale,</hi> who finding none now to withstand him, raigned in that desolation, and made himselfe Lord of those few people that remained there, upon whom ever sithence he hath continued his first usurped power, and now exacteth and extorteth upon all men what he list; So that now to subdue or expell an usurper, should bee no unjust enterprise or wrongfull warre, but a restitution of auncient right unto the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> from whence they were most unjustly expelled and long kept out.</p>

for the atcheiving of those warres now in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which seemes to aske no long time, nor great charge, so as the effecting thereof bee committed to men of sure trust, and sound experience, aswell in that Country, as in the manner of those services, for if it bee left in the hands of such rawe Captaines, as are usually sent out of <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereunto onely preferred by friendship, and not chosen by suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, it will soone fall to the ground.</p>

                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>Therefore it were meete (me thinkes) that such Captaines onely were thereunto employed, as have formerly served in that Country, and been at least Leivtenants unto other Captaines there. For otherwise being brought and transferred from other services a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, as in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and in the <hi>Low-Countryes,</hi> though they be of good experience in those, and have never so well deserved, yet in these they will be new to seeke, and before they have gathered expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, they shall buy it with great losse to her Majesty, either by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding of their companies, through ignorance of the places, and manner of the <hi>Irish</hi> services, or by loosing a great part of the time which is required hereunto, being but short, in which it might be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, almost before they have taken out a new lesson, or can tell what is to be done.</p>

                     <p>You are no good friend to new Captaines; It seemes <hi>Iren.</hi> that you barre them from the credit of this service: but (to say truth) me thinkes it were meete, that any one before he came to bee a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, should have beene a Souldiour, for <hi>parere qui nescit, nescit impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare.</hi> And besides there is great wrong done to the old Souldiour, from whom all meanes of advancement which is due unto him, is cut off by shuffling in these new cutting Captaines, into the place for which he hath long served, and perhaps better deserved. But now that you have thus (as I suppose) finished all the warre, and brought all things to that lowe ebbe which you speake of, what course will you take for the bringing in of that reformation which you intend, and recovering all things from this desolate estate? in which (mee thinkes) I behold them now left, unto that perfect establishment and new common-wealth which you have conceived of, by which so great good may redound unto her Majesty, and an assured peace bee confirmed, for that is it whereunto wee are now to looke, and doe greatly long for, being long sithence made weary with the huge charge which you have laide upon us, and with the strong indurance of so many complaints, so many delayes, so many doubts and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as will hereof (I know well) arise, unto the which before wee come, it were meete (me thinkes) that you should take some order for the Souldiour, which is now first to bee discharged and disposed of, some way: the which if you doe not well fore-see, may growe to as great inconvenience as all this that I suppose you have quit us from, by the loose leaving of so many thousand Souldiours, which from thence forth will be unfit for any labour or other trade, but must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther seeke service and imployment abroad, which may be dangerous,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:18659:239"/>
or else perhaps imploy themselves heere at home, as may bee discommodious.</p>

                     <p>You say very true, and it is a thing much mislyked in this our Common-wealth, that no better course is taken for such as have beene imployed in service, but that returning whether maymed and so unable to labour, or otherwise whole and sound, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards unwilling to worke, or rather willing to set the hang-man on worke. But that needeth another consideration; but to this which wee have now in hand, it is farre from my meaning to leave the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier so at randome, or to leave that waste Realme so weake and desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of strength, which may both defend it against others that might seeke then to set upon it, and also to keepe it from that relapse which I before did fore-cast. For it is one speciall good of this plot, which I would devise, that 6000. Souldiers of these whom I have now imployed in this service, and made thoroughly acquainted both with the state of the Countrey, and manners of the people, should henceforth bee still continued, and for ever maintayned of the Countrey, without any charge to her Majestie, and the rest that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are olde, and unable to serve any longer, or willing to fall to thrift, as I have seene many Souldiers after the service, to prove very good husbands, should bee placed in part of the landes by them wonne, at such rate, or rather better then others, to whom the same shall be set out.</p>

                     <p>Is it possible <hi>Irenaeus</hi>? can there be any such meanes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised, that so many men should be kept still in her Majesties service, without any charge to her at all. Surely this were an exceeding great good both to her Highnes to have so many olde Souldiers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ready at call, to what purpose soever she list to imploy them, and also to have that land thereby so strengthened, that it shall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feare any forraine Invasion, nor practise, which the <hi>Irish</hi> shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attempt, but shall keepe them under in continuall awe and firme obedience.</p>

                     <p>It is so indeed. And yet this truely I doe not take to be any matter of great difficultie, as I thinke it will also soone appeare unto you. And first we will speake of the North part, for that the same is of more weight and importance. So soone as it shall appeare that the Enemy is brought downe, and the stout Rebell either cut off, or driven to that wretchednesse, that hee is no longer able to holde up his head, but will come in to any conditions, which I assure my selfe will bee before the end of the second Winter, I wish that there bee a generall Proclamation made, that whatsoever Out-lawes will freely come in, and submit themselves to her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties mercy, shall have liberty so to doe, where they shall either finde that grace they desire, or have leave to returne againe in safety, upon which it is likely that so many as survive, will come in to sue for grace, of which, who so are thought meet for subjection, and fit to be brought to good, may be received, or else all of them;
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18659:240"/>
(for I thinke that all wilbe but a very few) upon condition and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance that they will submit themselves absolutely to her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties ordinance for them, by which they shall be assured of life and libertie, and be onely tyed to such conditions as shall bee thought by her meet for containing them ever after in due obedience. To the which conditions I nothing doubt, but that they will all most readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and upon their knees submit themselves, by the proofe of that which I have seene in <hi>Mounster.</hi> For upon the like Proclamation there, they all came in both tagg and ragg, and when as afterwardes many of them were denyed to be received, they bade them doe with them what they would, for they would not by any meanes returne againe, nor goe forth. For in that case who will not accept almost of any conditions, rather then dye of hunger and miserie.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>It is very likely so. But what then is the Ordinance, and what bee the conditions which you will propose unto them, which shall reserve unto them an assurance of life and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>So soone then as they have given the best assurance of themselves which may be required, which must be (I suppose) some of their principall men to remaine in hostage one for another, and some other for the rest, for other surety I reckon of none that may binde them, neither of wife, nor of children, since then perhappes they would gladly be ridde of both from the famine, I would have them first unarmed utterly, and stripped quite of all their warre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like weapons, &amp; then these conditions set downe, &amp; made knowne unto them, that they shall bee placed in <hi>Leinster,</hi> and have land given them to occupy and to live upon, in such sort as shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come good subjects, to labour thenceforth for their living, and to apply themselves to honest trades of civility, as they shall every one be found meete and able for.</p>

                     <p>No, I will place them all in the Countrey of the <hi>Birnes</hi> and <hi>Tooles,</hi> which <hi>Pheagh mac Hugh</hi> hath, and in all the lands of the <hi>Cavanaghes,</hi> which are now in rebellion, and all the lands which will fall to her Maiestie there-abouts, which I know to be very spacious and large enough to containe them, being very <note n="*" place="margin">This carrieth no fit proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the transplantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on intended by the Author, considering the large extent of <hi>Vlster,</hi> and the narrow bounds heere limited.</note> neere twenty or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty miles wyde.</p>

                     <p>At the same very time, and in the same very manner that I make that Proclamation to them of <hi>Vlster,</hi> will I have it also made to these, and upon their submission thereunto, I will take like assurance of them as of the other.

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:18659:240"/>
&amp; what else they have left them, the which I will cause to be divided amongst them in some meete sort, as each may thereby have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to sustaine himselfe a while withall, untill by his further tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile and labour of the Earth, hee shalbe able to provide himselfe better.</p>

                     <p>But will you give the land then freely unto them, and make them heires of the former Rebells? so may you perhaps make them also heires of all their former villainies and disorders, or how else will you dispose of them?</p>

                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>Not so: But all the lands will I give unto <hi>Englishmen,</hi> whom I will have drawne thither, who shall have the same with such estates as shall bee thought meete, and for such Rent, as shall eft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soones bee rated; under every of those <hi>Englishmen</hi> will I place some of those <hi>Irish</hi> to bee Tennants, for a certaine Rent according to the quantity of such Land, as every man shall have allotted unto him, and shalbe found able to wield, wherein this speciall regard shall be had, that in no place under any Land-lord, there shall bee many of them placed together, but dispersed wide from their acquaintance, and scattered farre abroad thorough all the Country: For that is the evill which now I finde in all <hi>Ireland,</hi> that the <hi>Irish</hi> dwell altogether by their septs, and severall nations, so as they may practise or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire what they will, whereas if there were <hi>English</hi> well placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, they should not bee able once to stirre or to murmure, but that it should be knowne, and they shortened according to their demerites.</p>

                     <p>You have good reason, but what rating of rents meane you, to what end doe you purpose the same?</p>

                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>My purpose is to rate the rent of all those lands of her Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties, in such sort unto those <hi>Englishmen</hi> which shall take them, as they shall be well able to live thereupon, to yeeld her Maiesty rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Chiefrie, and also give a competent maintenance unto the garrisons, which shall be there left amongst them; for those Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours (as I tolde you) remaining of the former garrisons, I cast to maintaine upon the rent of those landes, which shall bee escheated, and to have them divided thorough all <hi>Ireland,</hi> in such places, as shalbe thought most convenient, and occasion may require. And this was the course which the <hi>Romanes</hi> observed in the Conquest of <hi>England,</hi> for they planted some of their Legions in all places convenient, the which they caused the Countrey to maintaine, cutting upon every portion of land a reasonable rent, which they called <hi>Romescot,</hi> the which might not surcharge the Tennant or Free-holder, and might defray the pay of the Garrison: and this hath beene alwayes observed by all Princes in all Countries to them newly subdued, to set Garrisons amongst them, to containe them in dutie, whose burthen they made them to beare, and the want of this ordinance in the first conquest of <hi>Ireland</hi> by <hi>Henry the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi> was the cause of the so short decay of that government, and the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:18659:241"/>
quicke recovery againe of the <hi>Irish.</hi> Therefore by all meanes it is to bee provided for. And this is that I would blame, if it should not misbecome mee, in the late planting of <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> that no care was had of this Ordinance, nor any strength of garrison provided for, by a certaine allowance out of all the saide Landes, but onely the present profite looked into, and the safe continuance thereof for ever heereafter negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>

                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>But there is a Band of Souldiours layde in <hi>Mounster,</hi> to the maintenance of which, what oddes is there whether the Queene receiving the rent of the Countrey, doe give pay at her pleasure, or that there be a settled allowance appointed unto them out of her lands there?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>There is great oddes: For now that said rent of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is not appointed to the pay of the Souldiers, but it is by every other occasion comming betweene, converted to other uses, and the Souldiours in time of peace discharged and neglected as unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whereas if the said rent were appointed and ordained by an esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment to this end only, it should not bee turned to any other, nor in troublous times upon every occasion, her Majestie, bee so troubled with sending over new Souldiours as shee is now, nor the Countrie ever should dare to mutinie, having still the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diour in their necke, nor any forraine enemie dare to invade knowing there so strong and great a Garrison, allwayes ready to receive them.</p>

                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>Sith then you thinke that this Romescot of the pay of the Souldiours upon the land, to be both the readiest way to the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and least troublesome to her Majestie; tell us (I pray you) how would you have the said lands rated, that both a rent may rise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out unto the Queene, and also the Souldiers receive pay, which (mee thinkes) wilbe hard.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>First we are to consider, how much land there is in all <hi>Vlster,</hi> that according to the quantity thereof we may cesse the said rent and allowa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce issuing therout. <hi>Vlster</hi> (as the ancient records of that Realme doe testifie) doth containe 9000. Plow-lands, every of which Plow-lands containeth 120. Acres, after the rate of 21. foote to every perch of the Acre, every of which Plow-lands I will rate at 40<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. by the yeare, the which yearely rent amounteth in the whole to 18000<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. besides 6<hi rend="sup">s</hi>.8<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. chiefrie out of every Plow-land. But because the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Louth,</hi> being a part of <hi>Vlster,</hi> &amp; containing in it 712. Plow-lands is not wholly to escheate to her Majestie, as the rest, they having in all their warres continued for the most part dutifull, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise a great part thereof is now under the Rebells, there is an abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be made thereout of 400. or 500. Plow-lands, as I estimat the same, the which are not to pay the whole yearly rent of 40<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. out of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Plow-land, like as the escheated lands doe, but yet shall pay for their composition of cesse towards the keeping of Soldiers, 20<hi rend="sup">s</hi>. out of
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:18659:241"/>
every Plow-land, so as there is to bee deducted out of the former summe 200. or 300<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. yearely, the which may neverthelesse be suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the rent of the Fishings, which are exceeding great in <hi>Vlster,</hi> and also by an increase of rent in the best lands, and those that lye in the best places neere the Sea-coast. The which eighteene thousand pounds will defray the entertainment of 1500. Souldiers, with some over-plus towardes the pay of the victuallers, which are to bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the victualling of these garrisons.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>So then belike you meane to leave 1500. Souldiers in garrison for <hi>Vlster,</hi> to bee payde principally out of the rent of those lands, which shall be there escheated unto her Majestie. The which, where (I pray you) will you have them garrisoned?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>I will have them divided into three parts, that is, 500. in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very garrison, the which I will have to remaine in three of the same places, where they were before appointed, to wit, 500. at <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane,</hi> and about <hi>Longhfoile,</hi> so as they may holde all the passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of that part of the Countrey, and some of them bee put in wardes, upon all the straights thereabouts, which I know to be such, as may stoppe all passages into the Countrey on that side, and some of them also upon the <hi>Ban,</hi> up towardes <hi>Lough-Sidney,</hi> as I formerly directed. Also other 500. at the Fort upon <hi>Lough-Earne,</hi> and wardes taken out of them, which shall bee layde at <hi>Fermannagh,</hi> at <hi>Bealick,</hi> at <hi>Ballyshannon,</hi> and all the streightes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes <hi>Connaght,</hi> the which I know doe so strongly command all the passages that way, as that none can passe from <hi>Vlster</hi> into <hi>Connaght,</hi> without their leave. The last 500. shall also remaine in their Fort at <hi>Monoghan,</hi> and some of them bee drawne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wardes, to keepe the <hi>Kaies</hi> of all that Countrey, both down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and also towardes <hi>O Relies</hi> Countrey, and the Pale, and some at <hi>Eniskillin,</hi> some at <hi>Belturbut,</hi> some at the blacke Fort, and so along that River, as I formerly shewed in the first plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them. And moreover at every of these Forts, I would have the seate of a Towne layde forth and incompassed, in the which I would wish that there should inhabitants of all sortes, as Merchants, Artificers, and Husbandmen, bee placed, to whom there should Charters, and Fraunchises bee graunted to imcorporate them. The which as it wilbe no matter of difficultie to draw out of <hi>England,</hi> persons which would very gladly be so pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, so would it in short space turne those parts to great commodity, and bring ere long to her Majestie much profit, for those places are so fit for trade and trafficke, having most convenient out-gates by divers rivers to the Sea, and In-gates to the richest parts of the land, that they would soone be enriched, and mightily enlarged, for the very seating of the garrisons by them, besides the safetie and assurance which they shall worke unto them, will also draw thither store of people and trade, as I have seene ensample at <hi>Mariborogh</hi> and <hi>Philipstowne</hi> in <hi>Leinster,</hi> where by reason of those two Fortes,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:18659:242"/>
though there were but small wardes left in them, there are two good Townes now growne, which are the greatest stay of both those two Countries.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>Indeed (me thinkes) three such Townes as you say, would doe very well in those places with the Garrisons, and in short space would be so augmented, as they would bee able with little to in-wall themselves strongly, but for the planting of all the rest of the Countrey, what order would you take?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                     <p>What other then (as I said) to bring people out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which should inhabite the same, whereunto though I doubt not but great troopes would be readie to runne, yet for that in such cases, the worst and most decayed men are most ready to remove, I would wish them rather to bee chosen out of all partes of this Realme, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by discretion of wise men thereunto appointed, or by lot, or by the drumme, as was the olde use in sending forth of <hi>Colonies,</hi> or such other good meanes as shall in their wisedome bee thought meetest.

                     <p>By that which I have already said of <hi>Vlster,</hi> you may gather my opinion for <hi>Connaght,</hi> being very answereable to the former. But for that the lands which shal therein escheat unto her Maiesty, are not so intirely together, as that they can be acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pted in one summe, it nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that they be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sidered severally. The <hi>Province of Connaght</hi> in the whole containeth (as appeareth by the records of <hi>Dublin</hi>) 7200 plow lands of the former measure, and is of late divided into sixe Shires or Counties. <hi>The Countie of</hi>

The which two counties of <hi>Sligo</hi> &amp; <hi>Maio</hi> are supposed to containe almost 3000. plow-lands, the rent whereof rateably to the former, I valew almost at 6000<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. <hi>per annum.</hi> The countie of <hi>Roscoman,</hi> saving that which pertaineth to the house of <hi>Roscoman,</hi> &amp; some few o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>English</hi> there lately seated, is all one, and therefore it is wholly
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18659:242"/>
likewise to escheate to her Majesty, saving those portions of <hi>English</hi> inhabitants, and even those <hi>English</hi> doe (as I understand by them) pay as much rent to her Majesty, as is set upon those in <hi>Vlster,</hi> counting their composition money therewithall, so as it may all run into one reckoning with the former two counties: So that this county of <hi>Ros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coman</hi> containing 1200. Plow-lands, as it is accompted, amounteth to 2400<hi rend="sup">li.</hi> by the yeare, which with the former two counties rent, maketh about 8300<hi rend="sup">l</hi>. for the former wanted somewhat. But what the escheated lands of the county of <hi>Gallway</hi> and <hi>Letrim</hi> will rise unto, is yet uncertaine to define, till survey thereof be made, for that those lands are intermingled with the Earle of <hi>Clanricardes,</hi> and others lands, but it is thought they be the one halfe of both those counties, so as they may be counted to the value of one whole county, which containeth above 1000. plough-lands, for so many the least county of them all comprehendeth, which maketh 2000<hi rend="sup">li.</hi> more, that is in all ten or eleven thousand pounds. The other 2. counties must remaine till their Escheates appeare, the which letting passe yet, as unknowne, yet this much is knowne to be accompted for certaine, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of these two counties, being rated at 20. shil: every plowland, will amount to above 2000. pounds more, all which being laide to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the former, may be reasonably estimated to rise unto 13000 pounds, the which summe, together with the rent of the escheated lands in the two last countyes, which cannot yet be valued (being as I doubt not) no lesse then a thousand pounds more, will yeeld pay largely unto 1000. men and their victuallers, and 1000. pounds over towards the Governour.</p>

                     <p>Not altogether yet upon uncertainties, for this much may easily appeare unto you to be certaine, as the composition money of every plowland amounteth unto, for this I would have you princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to understand, that my purpose is to rate all the lands in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> at 20. shil: every plowland, for their composition towards the Garrison.

So that there being in all <hi>Ireland</hi> (as appeareth by their old records) 43920. plowlands, the same shall amount to the summe likewise of 43920. pounds, and the rest to be reared of the escheated lands which fall to her Majesty in the said Provinces of <hi>Vlster, Connaght,</hi> and that part of <hi>Leinster</hi> under the Rebells, for <hi>Mounster</hi> wee deale not yet withall.</p>

                     <p>The reckoning is easie, but in this accompt, by your leave, (me thinkes) you are deceived, for in this summe of the composition money, you accompt the lands of the undertakers of that Province, who are by their graunt from the Queene, to bee free from all such impositions whatsoever, excepting their onelie Rent, which is surely enough.</p>

                     <p>You say true, I did so, but the same 20. shil: for every plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, I meant to have deducted out of that rent due upon them to her Majesty, which is no hinderance, nor charge at all more to her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty then it now is, for all that rent which shee receives of them, shee putteth forth againe to the maintenance of the <hi>Presidency</hi> there, the charge wherof, it doth scarcely defray, whereas in this accompt both that charge of the <hi>Presidency,</hi> and also of a thousand Souldiours more, shall be maintained.</p>

                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>It should be well if it could be brought to that: But now where will you have your thousand men garrisond?</p>

                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>I would have a hundred of them placed at the <hi>Bantry</hi> where is a most fit place, not onely to defend all that side of the west part from forraine invasion, but also to answere all occasions of troubles, to which that Countrey being so remote is very subject: And surely there also would be planted a good towne, having both a good haven and a plentifull fishing, and the land being already escheated to her Majesty, but being forcibly kept from her, by one that proclaimes himselfe the Bastard Son of the Earle of <hi>Clancar,</hi> being called <hi>Donell Mac Carty,</hi> whom it is meete to foresee to. For whensoever the Earle shall die, all those lands (after him) are to come unto her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, he is like to make a foule stirre there, though of himselfe no power, yet through supportance of some others who lye in the wind, and looke after the fall of that inheritance. Another hundred I would have placed at <hi>Castle Mayne,</hi> which should keepe all <hi>Desmond</hi> and <hi>Kerry,</hi> for it answereth them both most conveniently: Also about <hi>Kilmore</hi> in the county of <hi>Corke</hi> would I have 2. hundred placed, the which should breake that nest of theives there, and answere equally both to the county of <hi>Limericke,</hi> and also the county of <hi>Corke</hi>: Another hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred would I have lye at <hi>Corke,</hi> aswell to command the towne, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to be ready for any forraine occasion: Likewise at <hi>Waterford,</hi> would I place 2. hundred, for the same reasons, and also for other privy causes, that are no lesse important: Moreover on this side of <hi>Arlo,</hi> neere to <hi>Muskery quirke,</hi> which is the Countrey of the <hi>Burkes,</hi> about <hi>Kill-Patricke,</hi> I would have two hundred more to be garrisond, which should skoure both the <hi>white Knights</hi> country and <hi>Arlo,</hi> and <hi>Muske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry quirk,</hi> by which places all the passages of Theives doe lye, which
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:18659:245"/>
convey their stealth from all <hi>Mounster</hi> downewards towards <hi>Tip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perary,</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> pale, and from the <hi>English</hi> pale also up unto <hi>Mounster,</hi> whereof they use to make a common trade: Besides that, ere long I doubt that the county of <hi>Tipperary</hi> it selfe, will neede such a strength in it, which were good to be there ready before the evill fall, that is dayly of some expected: And thus you see all your Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons placed.</p>

                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>I see it right well, but let me (I pray you) by the way aske you the reason, why in those Citties of <hi>Mounster,</hi> namely <hi>Waterford</hi> and <hi>Corke,</hi> you rather placed Garrisons, then in all others in <hi>Ireland.</hi> For they may thinke themselves to have great wrong to bee so char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged above all the rest?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>I will tell you, those two Citties, above all the rest, doe offer an in-gate to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> most fitly: But yet because they shall not take exceptions to this, that they are charged above all the rest, I will also lay a charge upon the others likewise, for indeed it is no reason that the corporate townes enioying great franchizes and priviledges from her Majesty, and living thereby not onely safe, but drawing to them the wealth of all the land, should live so free, as not to be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the burthen of this Garrison, for their owne safety, specially in this time of trouble, and seeing all the rest burthened (and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) I will thus charge them all ratably, according to their abilities towards their maintenance, the which her Majesty may (if she please) spare out of the charge of the rest, and reserve towards her other costes, or else adde to the charge of the presidency in the North.

                     <p>It is easie <hi>Irenaeus</hi> to lay a charge upon any towne, but to foresee how the same may be answered and defrayed, is the cheife part of good advisement.</p>

                     <p>Surely this charge which I put upon them, I know to bee so reasonable, as that it will not much be felt, for the port Townes that have benefit of shipping, may cut it easily off their trading, and in land townes of their corne and cattle, neither doe I see, but since to them especially the benefit of peace doth redound, that they especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally should beare the burthen of their safeguard and defence, as wee see all the townes of the Low-Countryes, doe cut upon themselves an excise of all things towards the maintenance of the warre that is made in their behalfe, to which though these are not to be compared
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:18659:245"/>
in richesse, yet are they to bee charged according to their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie.</p>

                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>But now that you have thus set up these forces of Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and provided well (as you suppose) for their pay, yet there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth to fore-cast how they may bee victualled, and where pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance thereof may bee made, for in <hi>Ireland</hi> it selfe, I cannot see almost how any thing is to bee had for them, being already so pittifully wasted, as it is with this short time of warre.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>For the first two yeares, it is needefull indeede that they bee victualled out of <hi>England</hi> thoroughly, from halfe yeare to halfe yeare, afore-hand. All which time the <hi>English</hi> Pale shall not bee burdened at all, but shall have time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themselves, and <hi>Mounster</hi> also being reasonably well sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, will by that time, (if God send seasonable weather) bee thoroughly well furnished to supply a great part of that charge, for I knowe there is great plenty of Corne, sent over Sea from thence, the which, if they might have sale for at home, they would bee glad to have money so neere hand, specially if they were streightly restrayned from transporting of it. Thereunto also there will bee a great helpe and furtherance gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in the putting forward of husbandrie, in all meete pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as heereafter shall in due place appeare. But heereafter when things shall growe unto a better strength, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey bee replenished with Corne, as in short space it will, if it bee well followed, for the Countrey people themselves are great plowers, and small spenders of Corne, then would I wish that there should bee good store of Houses and Magazins ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in all those great places of garrison, and in all great townes, as well for the victualling of Souldiers, and Shippes, as for all Occasions of suddaine services, as also for preventing of all times of dearth and scarcitie; and this want is much to bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playned of in <hi>England,</hi> above all other Countreyes, who trusting too much to the usuall blessing of the Earth, doe never fore-cast any such hard seasons, nor any such suddaine occasions as these troublous times may every day bring foorth, when it will bee too late to gather provision from abroad, and to bring it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes from farre, for the furnishing of Shippes or Souldiers, which peradventure may neede to bee presently imployed, and whose want may (which GOD forbid) hap to hazard a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>

                     <p>Indeede the want of those Magazins of victualls, I have oftentimes complayned of in <hi>England,</hi> and wondered at in other Countreyes, but that is nothing now to our purpose; but as for these garrisons which you have now so strongly planted throgh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Ireland,</hi> and every place swarming with Souldiers, shall there bee no end of them? For now thus being (me thinkes) I doe see rather a Countrey of warre, then of peace &amp; quiet, which you
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:18659:246"/>
earst pretended to worke in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for if you bring all things to that quietnesse that you said, what then needeth to maintaine so great for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as you have charged upon it.</p>

                     <p>I will unto you <hi>Eudox.</hi> in privitie discover the drift of my purpose, I meane (as I tolde you) and doe well hope thereby both to settle an eternall peace in that Countrey, and also to make it very profitable to her Majestie, the which I see must bee brought in with a strong hand, and so continued, till it runne in a stead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast course of governement, which in this sort will neither bee difficult nor dangerous, for the Souldier being once brought in for the service into <hi>Vlster,</hi> and having subdued it and <hi>Connaght,</hi> I will not have him to lay downe his Armes any more, till hee have effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that which I purpose, that is, first to have this generall compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition for maintenance of these thoroughout all the Realme, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the troublous times, and daylie danger which is threatned to this Realme by the King of <hi>Spaine.</hi> And thereupon to bestow all my Souldiers in such sort as I have done, that no part of all that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme shall be able to dare to quinch: Then will I eftsoones bring in my reformation, and thereupon establish such a forme of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as I may thinke meetest for the good of that Realme, which being once settled, and all things put into a right way, I doubt not but they will runne on fairely. And though they would ever seeke to swerve aside, yet shall they not bee able without forreine vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, once to remoove, as you your selfe shall soone (I hope) in your own reason readily conceive, which if it shall ever appeare, then may her Majestie at pleasure with-draw some of the garrisons, and turne their pay into her Purse, or if shee will never please so to doe (which I would rather wish) then shall shee have a number of brave olde Souldiers alwayes ready for any occasion that shee shee will imploy them unto, supplying their garrisons with fresh ones in their steed. The maintenance of whome, shall bee no more charge to her Majestie, then now that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alme is, for all the revenue thereof, and much more shee spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, even in the most peaceable times, that are there, as things now stand. And in time of warre, which is now surely every se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth yeare, shee spendeth infinite treasure besides, to small pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</p>

                     <p>I perceive your purpose, but now that you have thus strongly made way unto your reformation, and that I see the people so humbled and prepared, that they will and must yeeld to any Ordinance that shall bee given them. I doe much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to understand the same; for in the beginning you promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to shewe a meanes how to redresse all those inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and abuses, which you shewed to bee in that state of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which now stands there, as in the Lawes, Customes, and Religion, wherein I would gladly know first, whether in steed of those Lawes, you would have new lawes made, for now for ought
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:18659:246"/>
that I see, you may doe what you please.</p>

                     <p>I see <hi>Eudox.</hi> That you well remember our first purpose, and doe rightly continue the course thereof. First therefore to speake of lawes, since wee first beganne with them, I doe not thinke it now convenient, though it bee in the power of the Prince to change all the lawes, and make new; for that should breede a great trouble and confusion, aswell in the <hi>English</hi> there dwelling, and to be planted, as also in the <hi>Irish.</hi> For the <hi>English</hi> having beene alwayes trayned up in the <hi>English</hi> governement, will hardly bee inured to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the <hi>Irish</hi> will better be drawne to the <hi>English,</hi> then the <hi>English</hi> to the <hi>Irish</hi> governement. Therefore sithence wee cannot now apply lawes fit to the people, as in the first institutions of common-wealths it ought to bee, wee will apply the people, and fit them unto the Lawes, as it most conveniently may bee. The Lawes therefore wee resolve shall abide in the same sort that they doe, both <hi>Common-law</hi> and <hi>Statutes,</hi> onely such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in the common-law, and inconveniences in the Statutes, as in the beginning wee noted, and as men of deeper insight shall advise, may be changed by some other new acts and ordinances to bee by a Parlament there confirmed. As those for tryalls of pleas of the Crowne, and private rights betweene parties, colourable conveyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and accessaries.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>But how will those be redressed by Parlament, when as the <hi>Irish</hi> which sway most in Parlament (as you said) shall oppose themselves against them?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>That may well now bee avoyded: For now that so many Free-holders of <hi>English</hi> shall bee established, they together with Burgesses of Townes, and such other loyall <hi>Irish</hi>-men, as may bee preferred to bee Knights of the Shire, and such like, will bee able to beard, and to counter-poise the rest, who also being now more brought in awe, will the more easily submit to any such ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as shall bee for the good of themselves, and that Realme ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>You say well, for by the increase of Free-holders, for their numbers hereby will be greatly augmented, but how shall it passe thorough the higher house, which still must consiste all of <hi>Irish?</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>Marry that also may bee redressed by ensample of that which I have heard was done in the like case by King <hi>Edward</hi> the third (as I remember) who being greatly bearded and crossed by the Lords of the Cleargie, they being there by reason of the Lords Abbots, and others, too many and too strong for him, so as hee could not for their frowardnesse, order and reforme things as hee desired, was advised to direct out his Writts to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Gentle-men of the best ability and trust, entituling them therein <hi>Barons,</hi> to serve, and sitt as <hi>Barons</hi> in the next Parlament. By which meanes hee had so many
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:18659:247"/>
Barons in his Parlament, as were able to weigh downe the Cleargy and their friends: The which Barons they say, were not afterwardes Lords, but onely Baronets, as sundry of them doe yet retayne the name. And by the like device her Maiestie may now likewise curbe and cut short those <hi>Irish</hi> and unruly Lords, that hinder all good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>

And first in this our <hi>Realme</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> it is manifest by report of the Chronicles, and auncient Writers, that it was greatly infested with Robbers and Out-lawes, which lurking in Woods and fast places, used often to breake foorth into the high-wayes, and sometimes into small villages to robbe and spoyle.

So that if any one of them did start into any undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull action, the Borsolder was bound to bring him forth, who joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning eft-soones with all his Tything, would follow that loose per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son thorough all places, till they brought him in.

                     <p>Yea marry, most especially; for this you must know, that all the <hi>Irish</hi> almost boast themselves to be Gentlemen, no lesse then the <hi>Welsh</hi>; for if he can derive himselfe from the head of any Sept, (as most of them can, they are so expert by their Bardes) then hee holdeth himselfe a Gentleman, and thereupon scorneth to worke, or use any hard labour, which hee saith, is the life of a Peasant or Churle: But thenceforth becommeth either an horse-boy, or a <hi>Stocah</hi> to some Kerne, inuring himselfe to his weapon, and to the gentlemanly-trade-of stealing (as they count it.) So that if a gentleman or any wealthy man Yeoman of them, have any Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, the eldest of them perhaps shall be kept in some order, but all the rest shall shift for themselves, and fall to this occupation. And moreover it is a common use amongst some of their Gentlemens sonnes, that so soone as they are able to use their Weapons, they straight gather to themselves three or foure straglers, or Kearne, with whom wandring a while up and downe idlely the Countrey, taking onely meate, hee at last falleth unto some bad occasion that shall be offered, which being once made knowne, hee is thenceforth counted a man of worth, in whome there is courage, whereupon there draw to him many other like loose young men, which stirring him up with incouragement, provoke

him shortly to flat Rebellion, and this happens not onely some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the sonnes of their Gentle-men, but also of their Noble-men, specially of them who have base Sonnes. For they are not onely not ashamed to acknowledge them, but also boaste of them, and use them to such secret services, as they themselves will not be seene in, as to plague their Enemyes, to spoyle their Neighbours, to oppresse and crush some of their owne too stubburne Free-holders, which are not tractable to their wills.</p>

                     <p>This indeed <hi>(Eudoxus)</hi> hath beene hitherto, and yet is a common order amongst them, to have all the people booked by the Lords and Gentlemen: but yet the worst order that ever was devised,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:18659:248"/>
for by this booking of men, all the inferiour sort are brought under the command of their Lords, and forced to follow them into any action whatsoever. Now this you are to understand, that all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions which you see from time to time happen in <hi>Ireland,</hi> are not begun by the common people, but by the Lords and Captaines of Countries, upon pride or willfull obstinacy against the government, which whensoever they will enter into, they drawe with them all their people and followers, which thinke themselves bound to goe with them, because they have booked them and undertaken for them, and this is the reason that in <hi>England</hi> you have few such bad occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by reason that the noble men, how ever they should happen to be evill disposed, have no commaund at all over the Communalty, though dwelling under them, because that every man standeth upon himselfe, and buildeth his fortunes upon his owne faith and firme assurance: The which this manner of tything the poles will worke al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in <hi>Ireland.</hi> For by this the people are broken into many small parts like little streames, that they cannot easily come together into one head, which is the principall regard that is to be had in <hi>Ireland,</hi> to keepe them from growing unto such a head, and adhering unto great men.</p>

For reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all which, I wish that there were a commission graunted forth under the great Seale, as I have seene one recorded in the old Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell Booke of <hi>Mounster,</hi> that was sent forth in the time of Sir <hi>William Drurie,</hi> unto persons of speciall trust and judgement to inquire tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughout all <hi>Ireland,</hi> beginning with one county first, and so resting a while till the same were settled, by the verdict of a sound and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall Iury, how every man houldeth his land, of whom, and by what tenure, so that every one should be admitted to shew and exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite what right he hath, and by what services hee houldeth his land, whether in cheife or in soccage, or by Knights service, or how else soever.

                     <p>Neither should their lands be taken away from them, nor the utmost advantages inforced against them: But this by discretion of the Commissioners should be made knowne unto them, that it is not her Majesties meaning to use any such extreamity, but onely to reduce things into order of <hi>English</hi> Law, and make them hould their lands of her, and to restore to her, her due services, which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine out of those lands, which were aunciently held of her.

                     <p>In truth <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> this is more then ever I heard, that any <hi>English</hi> there, should bee worse then the <hi>Irish</hi>: Lord how quickely doth that Countrey alter mens natures? It is not for nothing (I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) which I have heard, that the Councell of <hi>England</hi> thinke it no good policie, to have that Realme reformed, or planted with <hi>English</hi> least they should grow so undutifull as the <hi>Irish,</hi> and become much more dangerous: As appeareth by the ensamples of the <hi>Lacies</hi> in the time of <hi>Edward the Second,</hi> which you spake of, that shooke off their allegiance to their naturall Prince, and turned to <hi>Edward le Bruce,</hi> to make him King of <hi>Ireland.</hi>

                     <p>No times have bene without bad men: but as for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the Councell of <hi>England</hi> which you spake of, that they should keepe that Realme from reformation, I thinke they are most lewdly abused, for their great carefulnesse, and earnest endeavours doe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse the contrary. Neither is it the nature of the Countrey to alter mens manners, but the bad mindes of the men, who having beene brought up at home under a straight rule of duty and obedience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alwayes restrayned by sharpe penalties from lewde behaviour, so soone as they come thither, where they see lawes more slackely ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the hard restraint which they were used unto now slacked, they grow more loose and carelesse of their duty, and as it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all men to love liberty, so they become flat libertines, and fall to all licentiousnes, more boldly daring to disobey the Law, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the presumption of favour and friendship, then any <hi>Irish</hi> dareth.</p>

                     <p>Then if that be so, (me thinkes) your late advisement was very evill, whereby you wished the <hi>Irish</hi> to be sowed and sprinckled with <hi>English,</hi> and in all the <hi>Irish</hi> Countryes to have <hi>English</hi> planted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, for to bring them to <hi>English</hi> fashions, since the <hi>English</hi> sooner drawe to the <hi>Irish,</hi> then the <hi>Irish</hi> to the <hi>English</hi>: for as you said before, if they must runne with the streame, the greater number will carry away the lesse: Therefore (me thinkes) by this reason it should bee better to part the <hi>Irish</hi> and <hi>English,</hi> then to mingle them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>

                     <p>Not so <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> but where there is no good stay of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and strong ordinances to hould them, there indeede the fewer will follow the more, but where there is due order of disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline and good rule, there the better shall goe foremost, and the worst shall follow. And therefore now, since <hi>Ireland</hi> is full of her owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ought not to be rooted out, and somewhat stored with <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish</hi> already, and more to be, I thinke it best by an union of manners and conformity of mindes, to bring them to be one people, and to put away the dislikefull conceipt both of the one, and the other, which will be by no meanes better, then by this intermingling of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:18659:250"/>
them: For neither all the <hi>Irish</hi> may dwell together, nor all the <hi>English,</hi> but by translating of them and scattering them amongst the <hi>English,</hi> not onely to bring them by dayly conversation, unto better liking of each other, but also to make both of them lesse able to hurt. And therefore when I come to the tything of them, I will tithe them one with another, &amp; for the most part will make an <hi>Irish</hi> man, the tything<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, whereby he shall take the lesse exception to partiality, and yet be the more tyed thereby. But when I come to the <hi>Head Borough,</hi> which is the head of the Lathe, him will I make an <hi>English</hi> man, or an <hi>Irish</hi> man of speciall assurance: As also when I come to appoint the <hi>Alderman,</hi> that is the head of the Hundreth, him will I surely choose to be an <hi>English</hi> man of speciall regard, that may be a stay and pillar of all the Borough under him.</p>

                     <p>Both that which you said <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> is true, and yet that which I say not untrue, for that which you spake of deviding the Countrey into hundreds, was a devision of the lands of the Realme, but this which I tell, was of the people, which were thus devided by the pole: So that hundreth in this sense signifieth a 100. pledges, which were under the command and assurance of their Alderman, the which (as I suppose) was also called a Wapentake, so named of touching the weapon or speare of their Alderman, and swearing to follow him faithfully, and serve their Prince truly: But others thinke that a Wapentake was 10. hundreds or boroghs: Likewise a Borogh, as I here use it, and as the old lawes still use, is not a Borogh towne, as
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:18659:251"/>
they now call it, that is a franchised towne: But a maine pledge of 100. free persons, therfore called a free borough or (as you say) <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci-plegium</hi>: For <hi>Borh</hi> in old <hi>Saxon</hi> signifieth a pledge or surety, and yet is so used with us in some speeches (as <hi>Chaucer</hi> saith) <hi>S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Iohn to Borroh,</hi> that is for assurance and warranty.</p>

                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>I conceive the difference: But now that you have thus devided the people into these Tythings and Hundreths, how will you have them so preserved and continued, for people doe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten change their dwelling places, and some must die, whilst other some doe growe up into strength of yeares, and become men.</p>

                     <p>These Hundreds I would wish to assemble themselves once every yeare with their pledges, and to present themselves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Iustices of the peace, which shall bee thereunto appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to bee surveyed and numbred, to see what change hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened since the yeare before, and the defects to supplie, of young plants late growne up, the which are diligently to bee overlooked and viewed of what condition and demeanour they be, so as pledges may bee taken for them, and they put into order of some Tything, of all which alterations notes is to be taken, and Bookes made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of accordingly.</p>

                     <p>Now (mee thinkes) <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> you are to bee warned to take heede lest unawares you fall into that inconvenience which you formerly found fault with in others: Namely, that by this booking of them, you doe not gather them into a new head, and having broken their former strength, doe not unite them more strongly againe: For every <hi>Alderman</hi> having all these free pledges of his Hundred under his commaund, may (me thinkes) if hee be evill disposed drawe all his Companie into an evill action. And likewise by this assembling of them once a yeare unto their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derman by their Weapentakes, take heede lest you also give them occasion and meanes to practise together in any conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racyes.</p>

                     <p>Neither of both is to be doubted, for their Aldermen and Head Boroughes, will not be such men of power and countenance of themselves, being to be chosen thereunto, as neede to be feared: Neither if hee were, is his Hundred at his commaund, further then his Princes service, and also every Tything man, may controll him in such a case. And as for the assembling of the Hundred, much lesse is any danger thereof to be doubted, seeing it is before some Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of Peace, or some high Constable to bee thereunto appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: So as of these Tythings there can no perill ensue, but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine assurance of peace and great good, for they are thereby with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawne from their Lords, and subjected to the Prince: Moreover for the better breaking of these heads and septs, which (I tould you) was one of the greatest strengthes of the <hi>Irish,</hi> me thinkes it should bee very well to renewe that ould Statute, which was made in the <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>The next that I will doe, shalbe to appoint to every one that is not able to live of his Free-holde, a certaine Trade of life, to which he shall finde himselfe fittest, and shalbe thought ablest, the which trade hee shalbe bound to follow, &amp; live onely thereupon. All trades therefore are to be understood to be of three kindes; <hi>Manuall, Intellectuall,</hi> &amp; <hi>mixed.</hi> The first containing all such as needeth exercise of bodily labour, to the performance of their profession. The second consisting only of the exercise of wit &amp; reason. The third sort, part of bodily labor, &amp; part of the wit, but depending most of industrie and carefulnes. Of the first sort be all handy-crafts &amp; husbandry labour. Of the second be all Sciences, and those which be called the liberall Arts. Of the third is Merchandize &amp; Chafferie, that is, buying &amp; sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, &amp; without all these three, there is no Common-wealth can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most consist, or at the least be perfect. But the Realme of <hi>Ireland</hi> wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the most principall of them, that is, the intellectuall; therfore in seeking to reforme her state, it is specially to be looked unto. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by husbandry, which supplyeth unto us all things necessary for food, wherby we chiefly live. Therefore it is first to be provided for. The first thing therefore that wee are to draw these new tythed men into, ought to be husbandry. First, because it is the most easie to be learned, needing onely the labour of the Body. Next, because it is most generall and most needfull, then because it is most naturall; and lastly, because it is most enemy to warre, and most hateth unquietnes: As the Poet saith,
<q>—bella execrata colonis.</q>
for husbandry being the nurse of thrift, &amp; the daughter of industrie and labour, detesteth all that may worke her scathe, and destroy the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18659:252"/>
travaile of her hands, whose hope is all her lives comfort un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Plough, therefore are those Kearne, Stocaghes and Horse-boyes to bee driven and made to imploy that ablenesse of Bodie which they were wont to use to theft and villainy, hencefoorth to labour and industry. In the which, by that time they have spent but a little paine, they will finde such sweetenesse and happy contentment, that they will afterwardes hardly bee haled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from it, or drawne to their wonted lewde life in theeverie and roguerie. And being once thus inured thereunto, they are not onely to bee countenanced and encouraged by all good meanes, but also provided that their children after them may be brought up likewise in the same, and succeede in the roomes of their Fathers. To which end there is a <note n="*" place="margin">Anno 25<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
                           <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.</note> Statute in <hi>Ireland</hi> already well provided, which commaundeth that all the sonnes of husbandmen shall be trained up in their Fathers trades, but it is (God wot) very slenderly executed.</p>

                     <p>But doe you not count in this trade of husbandry, pastu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of cattle, and keeping of their Cowes, for that is reckoned as a part of husbandrie.</p>

                     <p>I know it is, and needefully to bee used, but I doe not meane to allow any of those able bodies, which are able to use bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily labour, to follow a few Cowes grazeing. But such impotent persons, as being unable for strong travaile, are yet able to drive Cattle to and fro to their pasture, for this keeping of Cowes, is of it selfe a very idle life, and a fit nurserie for a Thiefe. For which cause (you remember) I disliked the <hi>Irish</hi> manner of keeping <hi>Boolies</hi> in Summer upon the mountaines, and living after that savage sort. But if they will algates feede many Cattle, or keepe them on the Mountaines, let them make some townes neare to the Mountaines side, where they may dwell together with neighbours, and bee conversant in the view of the world. And to say truth, though <hi>Ireland</hi> bee by nature coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a great soyle of pasture, yet had I rather have fewer Cowes kept, and men better mannered, then to have such huge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of Cattle, and no increase of good conditions. I would therefore wish that there were some ordinances made amongst them, that whosoever keepeth twentie Kine, should keep a Plough going, for otherwise all men would fall to pasturage, and none to husbandry, which is a great cause of this dearth now in <hi>England,</hi> and a cause of the usuall stealthes in <hi>Ireland</hi>: for looke into all Countreyes that live in such sort by keeping of Cattle, and you shall finde that they are both very barbarous and uncivill, and also greatly given to warre. The <hi>Tartarians,</hi> the <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,</hi> the <hi>Norwegians,</hi> the <hi>Gothes,</hi> the <hi>Armenians,</hi> and many other doe witnesse the same. And therefore since now wee purpose to draw the <hi>Irish</hi> from desire of warre and tumults, to the love of peace and civility, it is expedient to abridge their great custome of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:18659:252"/>
hardening, and augment their trade of tillage and husbandrie. As for other occupations and trades, they need not bee inforced to, but every man to bee bound onely to follow one that hee thinkes himselfe aptest for. For other trades of Artificers will be occupied for very necessitie, and constrayned use of them, and so likewise will merchandize for the gaine thereof, but learning and bringing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And for that end every Parish should be forced to keepe a pettie Schoole-master, adjoyning unto the Parish Church, to bee the more in view, which should bring up their children in the first Elements of Letters: And that in every Countrey or Baronie, they should keepe an other able Schoole-master, which should instruct them in Grammer, and in <note n="*" place="margin">How requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site also an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversitie is for the further growth in learning, the judicious well know.

                     <p>I have in minde so to doe; but let me (I pray you) first finish that which I had in hand, whereby all the ordinances which shall afterwardes bee set for Religion, may abide the more firmely, and bee observed more diligently. Now that this people is thus tythed and ordered, and every one bound unto some ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest trade of life, which shall bee particularly entered and set downe in the tything Booke, yet perhappes there will bee some
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:18659:253"/>
stragglers and runnagates, which will not of themselves come in and yeeld themselves to this order, and yet after the well finishing of the present warre, and establishing of the Garrisons in all strong places of the Countrey, where their wonted refuge was most, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose there will few stand out, or if they doe, they will shortly bee brought in by the Eares: But yet afterwardes, lest any one of them should swerve, or any that is tyed to a trade, should afterwardes not follow the same, according to this institution, but should straggle up and downe the Countrey, or mich in Corners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst their Friends idlely, as <hi>Carrowes, Bardes, Iesters,</hi> and such like, I would wishe that a Provost <hi>Marshall</hi> should bee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in every Shire, which should continually walke about the Countrey, with halfe a dozen, or halfe a score horsemen, to take up such loose persons as they should finde thus wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, whome hee should punish by his owne authority, with such paines as the person shall seeme to deserve; for if hee be but once so taken idlely roguing, hee may punish him more lightly, as with stockes, or such like; but if hee bee found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine so loytering, hee may scourge him with whippes, or rodds, after which if hee bee againe taken, let him have the bitternesse of Marshall lawe. Likewise if any reliques of the olde rebellion bee found by any, that either have not come in and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themselves to the Law, or that having once come in, doe breake forth againe, and walke disorderly, let them taste of the same cuppe in Gods Name, for it was due to them for their first guilt, and now being revived by their later loosenesse, let them have their first desert, as now being found unfit to live in the Common-wealth.</p>

                     <p>This were a good ordinance: but mee thinkes it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary charge, and also unfit to continue the name or forme of any Marshall-Law, when as there is a proper Officer already appointed for these turnes, to wit the Sheriffe of the Shire, whose peculiar Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it is to walke up and downe his Bayli-wicke, as you would have a Marshall to snatch up all those Runnagates and unprofitable mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and to bring them to his Gaole to bee punished for the same. Therefore this may well be spared.</p>

                     <p>Not so (me thinkes) for though the Sheriffe have this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of himselfe to take up all such stragglers, and imprison them, yet shall hee not doe so much good, nor worke that terrour in the hearts of them, that a Marshall will, whom they shall know to have power of life and death in such cases, and specially to bee appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for them: Neither doth it hinder that, but that though it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the Sheriffe, the Sheriffe may doe therein what hee can, and yet the Marshall may walke his course besides, for both of them may doe the more good, and more terrifie the idle Rogue, knowing that though he have a watch upon the one, yet hee may light upon the other: But this proviso is needefull to bee had in this case,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:18659:253"/>
that the Sheriffe may not have the like power of life, as the Marshall hath, and as heretofore they have beene accustomed; for it is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to give power of life into the hands of him which may have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by the parties death, as if the said loose liver have any goods of owne, the Sheriffe is to seize thereupon, whereby it hath come to passe, that some who have not deserved iudgement of death, though otherwise perhaps offending, have beene for their goods sake caught up, and carryed straight to the bough, a thing indeed very pittifull &amp; horrible. Therefore by no meanes I would have the Sheriffe have such authority, nor yet to imprison that Lozell, till the Sessions, for so all Gaoles might soone be filled; but to send him to the Marshall, who eftsoones finding him faultie, shall give him meete correction, and ridd him away forthwith.</p>

                     <p>For Religion little have I to say, my selfe being (as I said) not professed therein, and it selfe being but one, so as there is but one way therein, for that which is true onely is, and the rest is not at all, yet in planting of Religion, thus much is needefull to bee observed, that it bee not sought forcibly to bee impressed into them with terrour and sharpe penalties, as now is the manner, but rather delivered and intimated with mildenesse and gentlenesse, so as it may not be hated before it be understood, and their professors despised and rejected. And therefore it is expedient that some discreete Ministers of their owne Countrey-men, bee first sent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver amongst them, which by their meeke perswasions and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as also by their sober lives and conversations, may draw them first to understand, and afterwards to imbrace the doctrine of their salvation; for if that the auncient godly Fathers, which first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted them, when they were Infidells, to the Faith, were able to pull them from Idolatry and Paganisme, to the true Beliefe in <hi>CHRIST,</hi> as <hi>S.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:18659:254"/>
Gods harvest, which is even ready for the sickle, and all the Fields yellow long agoe, doubtlesse those good olde godly Fathers, will (I feare mee) rise up in the day of judgement to condemne them.</p>

                     <p>Leave we that to their grave considerations; but proceed we forward. Next care in Religion is to build up and repayre all the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined Churches, whereof the most part lye even with the ground, and some that have bin lately repayred, are so unhandsomely pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and thatched, that men doe even shunne the places for the uncomelinesse thereof; therefore I would wishe that there were order taken to have them built in some better forme, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Churches of <hi>England</hi>; for the outward shewe (assure your selfe) doth greatly drawe the rude people to the reverencing and frequenting thereof. What ever some of our late too nice fooles say, there is nothing in the seemely forme, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:18659:254"/>
comely order of the Church. And for the keeping and continuing them, there should likewise Church-wardens of the gravest men in the parish be appointed, as they bee here in <hi>England,</hi> which should take the yearely charge both hereof, and also of the Schoole-houses which I wish to be built neere the said Churches, for maintenance of both which, it were meete that some small portion of lands were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted, sith no more Mortmaines are to be looked for.</p>

                     <p>There is no way to helpe that, but to lay 2. or 3. of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, untill such time as the Countrey grow more rich and better inhabited, at which time the Tythes, and other obventions will also be more augmented and better valued: But now that we have thus gone through all the 3. sorts of trades, and set a course for their good establishment: let us (if it please you) goe next to some other neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full points of other publicke matters no lesse concerning the good of the Common-wealth, though but accidentally depending on the former. And first I wish that order were taken, for the cutting and opening of all places through woods, so that a wide way of the space of 100. yards might be layde open in every of them, for the safety of travellers, which use often in such perillous places to be robbed, and sometimes murdered. Next that Bridges were built upon the Rivers, and all the fordes marred and spilt, so as none might passe any other way but by those Bridges, and every Bridge to have a gate and a gate-house set thereon, whereof this good will come that no night stealths which are commonly driven in by-wayes, and by blinde fordes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used of any, but such like shall not be conveyed out of one country into another, as they use, but they must passe by those Bridges, where they may either be haply encountred, or easily tracked, or not suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to passe at all, by meanes of those gate-houses thereon: Also that in all straights and narrow passages, as betweene 2. boggs, or through any deepe foord, or under any mountaine side, there should be some little Fortilage, or wooden Castle set, which should keepe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund that straight, whereby any Rebells that should come into the country, might be stopped that way, or passe with great perill. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over that all High wayes should be fenced and shut up on both sides, leaving onely 40. foote breadth for passage, so as none should be able to passe but through the high wayes, whereby theeves and night Robbers might be the more easily pursued and encountred, when there shall be no other way to drive their stolne cattle, but therein, as I formerly declared. Further that there should bee in sundry conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient places, by the high wayes, townes appointed to bee built, the which should be free Burgesses, and incorporate under Bayliffes, to be by their inhabitants well and strongly intrenched, or otherwise
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:18659:255"/>
fenced, with gates on each side thereof, to be shut nightly, like as there is in many places in the <hi>English</hi> pale, and all the wayes about it to be strongly shut up, so as none should passe but through those townes: To some of which it were good that the priviledge of a market were given, the rather to strengthen and inable them to their defence, for there is nothing doth sooner cause civility in any countrie then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Market townes, by reason that people repairing often thither for their needes, will dayly see and learne civill manners of the better sort: Besides, there is nothing doth more stay and strenghthen the Country, then such corporate townes, as by proofe in many Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious hath appeared, in which when all the countryes have swerved, the townes have stood fast, and yeelded good releife to the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours in all occasions of services. And lastly there is nothing doth more enrich any country or Realme, then many townes, for to them will all the people drawe and bring the fruits of their trades, aswell to make money of them, as to supply their needefull uses, and the Countrymen will also be more industrious in tillage, and rearing of all husbandry commodities, knowing that they shall have ready sale for them at those townes, and in all those townes should there be convenient Innes, erected for the lodging and harbouring of Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, which are now oftentimes spoyled by lodging abroad in weake thatched houses, for want of such safe places to shroude them in.</p>

                     <speaker>Eudox.</speaker>
                     <p>But what profit shall your market townes reape of their market? when as each one may sell their corne and cattle abroad in the country, and make their secret bargaines amongst themselves as now I understand they use.</p>

                     <p>Indeede <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> they doe so, and thereby no small incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience doth rise to the Common-wealth, for now when any one hath stolne a Cowe or a Garron, he may secretly sell it in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try without privity of any, wheras if he brought it to a market towne it would perhaps be knowne, and the theife discovered. Therefore it were good that a straight ordinance were made, that none should buy or sell any cattle, but in some open market, (there being now market townes every where at hand,) upon a great penalty, neither should they likewise buy any corne to sell the same againe, unlesse it were to make malt thereof, for by such ingrosing and regrating wee see the dearth that now commonly raigneth here in <hi>England,</hi> to have beene caused. Hereunto also is to bee added that good ordinance, which I remember was once proclaimed throughout all <hi>Ireland.</hi> That all men should marke their cattle with an open severall marke upon their flanckes or Buttockes, so as if they happened to be stolne, they might appeare whose they were, and they which should buy them, might thereby suspect the Owner, and be warned to abstaine from buying them of a suspected person, with such an unknowne marke.</p>

                     <p>They were not omitted, for there were through all places of the Country convenient, many good townes seated, which tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough that inundation of the <hi>Irish,</hi> which I first told you of, were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly wasted and defaced, of which the ruines are yet in many places to be seene, and of some no signe at all remaining, save onely their bare names, but their seates are not to be found.</p>

                     <speaker>Iren.</speaker>
                     <p>The cause thereof was, for that after their desolation, they were begged by Gentlemen, of the Kings, under colour to repaire them, and gather the poore reliques of the people againe together, of whom having obtained them, they were so farre from reedifying of them, as that by all meanes they have endeavoured to keepe them waste, least that being repaired, their Charters might be renewed, and their Burgesses restored to their lands, which they had now in their possession, much like as in those old monuments of Abbeyes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious houses, we see them likewise use to doe: For which cause it is judged that King <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, bestowed them upon them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that thereby they should never bee able to rise againe. And even so doe these Lords, in these poore old corporate townes, of which I could name divers, but for kindling of displeasure. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as I wished many corporate townes to be erected, so would I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine wish them to be free, not depending upon the service, nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the commaund of any but the Governour. And being so, they will both strengthen all the Country round about them, which by their meanes will be the better replenished and enriched, and also be as continuall houldes for her Majesty, if the people should revolt or breake out againe, for without such it is easie to forrage and over-run the whole land. Let be for ensample all those Free-boroughes, in the Low-Countryes, which are now all the strength thereof.

                     <p>I delight not to lay open the blames of great Magistrates to the rebuke of the world, and therefore their reformation I will not meddle with, but leave unto the wisedome of greater heads to be considered, only thus much I will speake generally thereof, to satisfie your desire, that the government and cheife Magistracy, I wish to continue as it doth, to wit, that it be ruled by a Lord Deputy or Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, for that it is a very safe kinde of rule, but there withall I wish that over him there were placed also a Lord Lieutenant, of some of the greatest personages in <hi>England,</hi> such a one I could name, upon whom the eye of all <hi>England</hi> is fixed, and our last hopes now rest, who being intituled with that dignity, and being here alwayes resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, may backe and defend the good course of that government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all maligners, which else will through their cunning working under hand, deprave and pull backe what ever thing shall be begun or intended there, as we commonly see by experience at this day, to the utter ruine and desolation of that poore Realme, and this Leiutenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie should be no discountenancing of the Lord Deputy, but rather a strengthning of all his doings, for now the cheife evill in that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is, that no Governour is suffered to goe on with any one course, but upon the least information here, of this or that, hee is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stopped and crossed, or other courses appointed him from hence which he shall run, which how inconvenient it is, is at this houre too well felt: And therefore this should be one principall in the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Lord Deputies authority, that it should bee more ample and absolute then it is, and that he should have uncontrouled power, to doe any thing, that he with the advisement of the Councell should thinke meete to be done: For it is not possible for the Councell here, to direct a Governour there, who shall be forced oftentimes to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the necessitie of present actions, and to take the suddaine advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of time, which being once lost will not bee recovered, whilst through expecting direction from hence, the delayes whereof are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes through other greater affaires most irkesome, the oportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nityes there in the meane time passe away, and great danger often groweth, which by such timely prevention might easily bee stopped: And this (I remember) is worthily observed by <hi>Machiavel</hi> in his discourses upon <hi>Livie,</hi> where he commendeth the manner of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> government, in giving absolute power to all their Councellors and Governours, which if they abused, they should afterwards deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly answere: And the contrary thereof he reprehendeth in the States of <hi>Venice,</hi> of <hi>Florence,</hi> and many other principalityes of <hi>Italy</hi>: who use to limit their cheife Officers so strictly, as that thereby they have oftentimes lost such happy occasions, as they could never come unto againe: The like whereof, who so hath beene conversant in that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of <hi>Ireland,</hi> hath too often seene to their great hinderance and hurt. Therefore this I could wish to be redressed, and yet not so but that in particular things he should be restrained, though not in

the generall government, as namely in this that no offices should bee sould by the Lord Deputy for money, nor no pardons, nor no prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions bought for reward, nor no beoves taken for Captainries of Countryes, nor no shares of Bishopricks for nominating of Bishops, nor no forfeytures, nor dispensations with poenall Statutes given to their servants or friends, nor no selling of licences for transportation of prohibited wares, and specially of corne and flesh, with many the like, which neede some manner of restrainte, or else very great trust in the honorable disposition of the Lord Deputy.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have <hi>Eudoxus,</hi> as briefly as I could, and as my memorie would serve me, run through the state of that whole Country, both to let you see, what it now is, and also what it may bee by good care and amendment: Not that I take upon me to change the policy of so great a kingdome, or prescribe rules to such wise men, as have the handling thereof, but onely to shew you the evills, which in my small experience I have observed, to be the cheife hinderance of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and by way of conference to declare my simple opinion for the redresse thereof, and establishing a good course for government, which I doe not deliver as a perfect plot of mine owne invention to be onely followed, but as I have learned and understood the same by the consultations and actions of very wise Governours and Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, whom I have (sometimes) heard treate hereof: So have I thought good to set downe a remembrance of them for my owne good, and your satisfaction, that who so lift to overlooke them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though perhaps much wiser then they which have thus advised of that State, yet at lest by comparison hereof, may perhaps better his owne judgment, and by the light of others fore-going him, may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after with more ease, and haply finde a fairer way thereunto, then they which have gone before.</p>

                     <l>There was the Liffie, rolling downe the lea,</l>
                     <l>The sandy Slane, the stony Aubrian,</l>
                     <l>The spacious Shenan spreading like a sea,</l>
                     <l>The pleasant Boyne, the fishy fruitfull Ban,</l>

                     <l>Whereof conceiving, she in time forth brought</l>
                     <l>These three faire sons, which being thence forth powrd</l>

                     <l>The next the stubburne Newre, whose waters gray</l>

                     <l>The third, the goodly Barow, which doth hoord</l>
                     <l>Great heapes of Salmons in his deepe bosome:</l>
                     <l>All which long sundred, doe at last accord</l>
                     <l>To joyne in one, ere to the sea they come,</l>

                     <l>There also was the wide embayed Mayre,</l>
                     <l>The pleasant Bandon crownd with many a wood,</l>
                     <l>The spreading Lee, that like an Iland faire</l>

                     <l>With many more, whose names no tongue can tell.</l>
                     <l>All which that day in order seemely good</l>

                     <l>With whom the woody gods did oft consort:</l>

                  <lg>

                     <l>For first she springs out of two marble Rocks,</l>
                     <l>On which, a grove of Oakes high mounted growes;</l>
                     <l>That as a girlond seemes to deck the locks</l>
                     <l>Of some faire Bride, brought forth with pompous showes</l>
