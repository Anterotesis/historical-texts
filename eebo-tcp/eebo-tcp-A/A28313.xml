            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <hi>PROV. xxvii. iv. Latter part of the Verſe.</hi>
               </bibl>
               <q>
                  <p>— Who is able to stand before Envy?</p>
               </q>
               <bibl>
                  <hi>The whole Verſe runs thus:</hi>
               </bibl>
               <q>
                  <p>Wrath is Cruel, and Anger is Outragious: But who is able to ſtand before Envy?</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>AND in theſe Words the Wiſe Man deſigns to ſet forth the great Evil of <hi>Envy,</hi> to ſhew us how violent and miſchievous a Paſſion it is; and to that end he compares it with two very exorbitant commotions of Mans mind, with Wrath, and with Anger, or <hi>F<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RY</hi>; for ſo it ſhould rather have been Tranſlated, the word in the Original, implying the higheſt degree, or utmoſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Anger. Now, a man that is in Wrath or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger againſt any one, forgets all kindneſs to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; he will no longer be govern'd by any law of Love or Charity, in any of his Actions towards him. Therefore ſayes the Wiſe man, <hi>Wrath is Cruel,</hi> all Kindneſs is loſt in an angry, or wrathful mans heart.</p>
            <p>And yet perhaps ſuch an one will not do a manifeſt wrong or injuſtice to the perſon he is Angry with: But then, when Anger riſes to a great exceſs, it is rightly term'd Fury; and one, that is poſſeſs'd with
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65178:3"/>
it, is a Mad-man for the time. He hath no regard to Right or Wrong, he cares not what injury or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief he doth, and therefore ſayes the wiſe man, <hi>Fury is Outragious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet worſe than either of theſe, more unkind and uncharitable, more unjuſt, more violent, and much more miſchievous than either of them, is <hi>Envy</hi>; There is neither any goodneſs, nor yet any ſtrength, that is a ſufficient guard againſt it. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is no mans Innocency, no mans Vertue, that can ſecure him from the direful ſtrokes of Envy. Nay, many times the more Innocent, the more Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, uſeful and beneficial a man is in his place and ſtation, Envy encreaſes the more againſt him. The Reputation, Dignity, or Profit, ſuch a man gains by his good Qualities, inflames the hearts of the Envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and makes them contrive and act all they can for his Ruine.</p>
            <p>When there were but two Brothers in the world, and there muſt be the ſtrongeſt, and moſt engaging Tie between them, both of natural Affection, and Love of Society; yet Envy broke through all this, and made one of them inhumanly Murder the other; and that for no other reaſon, but becauſe <hi>Abel,</hi> for the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſincerity of his heart, was more approv'd of by God than <hi>Cain.</hi> This example of the violent and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious cruelty and injuſtice of Envy we have in the beginning of the World; we have another like it in the beginning of Gods chuſing him a peculiar Church. There we find <hi>Eſau</hi> would have killed his Brother, for no other reaſon, but becauſe <hi>Jacob</hi> valued being the Father of the Faithful more than profane <hi>Eſau</hi> did, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:65178:3"/>
ſo God determin'd to have his Church in <hi>Jacob</hi>'s off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring. And in that very off-ſpring we have preſently a ſtrange inſtance of the blind and inexorable cruelty of Envy in the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> otherwiſe good men, who for no other reaſon, but becauſe God had in Viſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd his favour to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and his Father lov'd him, ſet themſelves in the moſt bitter manner againſt the poor innocent child, and had no compaſſion on him, when <hi>They ſaw the anguiſh of his Soul</hi>; when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought them, they wou'd have kill'd him: The greateſt pity they cou'd ſhew him, was, to ſell their Brother to be a ſlave to Infidels, as St. <hi>Stephen</hi> ſayes, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.9. <hi>The Patriarchs mov'd with Envy, ſold</hi> Joſeph <hi>into</hi> Egypt.</p>
            <p>We have likewiſe a Signal Inſtance in the Hiſtory of <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> of the great Injuſtice and Vile In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude of Envy; For certainly never was Maſter better ſerv'd, than <hi>Saul</hi> was by <hi>David</hi>; never did one man receive greater Benefits from another; For firſt, the man, whom the whole Hoſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> fear'd was ſlain by <hi>David</hi>; the Kings Enemies were often diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited and deſtroyd by <hi>David. Saul</hi> himſelf was frequently refreſh'd and comforted by him, when he lay under the heavy oppreſſion of a Melancholly and an Evil Spirit; His life alſo was divers times ſav'd and preſerv'd by him, <hi>David</hi> had married his Daughter, and was his ſon's friend; He never had done the leaſt Injury either to him or his, but ſhew'n all kindneſs to the Houſe of <hi>Saul</hi>; and yet <hi>Saul</hi> looking upon him with an Envious Eye, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.9. continually with great eagerneſs hunted after his life to deſtroy it.</p>
            <p>But the greateſt inſtance of all, of the moſt wicked
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:65178:4"/>
Injuſtice and baſeneſs of Envy, is in the Envy of the Scribes and Phariſees againſt our Saviour; who was purely Envied for the Reputation of his goodneſs, and nothing elſe; for he neither had nor ſought any earthly Title or Riches; neither cou'd they accuſe him of any ſin; And yet for Envy, as <hi>Pilate</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf cou'd ſee, They deliver'd him up to the moſt cruel and ſhameful Death.</p>
            <p>And as there is no Innocency ſo clear, no Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo perfect, that can preſerve a Man from the ſoul Reproaches, the malicious Contrivances, and the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ining practices of Envy: So,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is no Man ſo great or powerful, or of ſo ſecure an Eſtate or Fortune, but the Violence of Envy hath been capable of overthrowing him. Sometimes a private Envy hath been able to do it; but a common Envy hath ſeldom fail'd of accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Mans ruine. We have many Inſtances in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writ of Great Men deſtroy'd by Envy; as <hi>Abner</hi> Captain of the Hoſt of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Amaſa</hi> Captain of the Hoſt of <hi>Judah,</hi> both of them, as <hi>David</hi> obſerv'd, better Men than <hi>Joab,</hi> who through Envy ſlew them. And in Civil Hiſtory, in the Hiſtory of all Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, we find innumerable Examples of Great and Mighty Men, that have been overthrown and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd purely by Envy. Nay, we have Inſtances even of Princes themſelves, when they have thought their Honour oblig'd them to ſtand between their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites and a general Envy, that have fallen together with them. There is no ſtanding before a Common Envy; there is nothing to be done but to get out of the way of it, unleſs a Man will bravely reſolve to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65178:4"/>
become a Sacrifice for Truth, and the Common Good: For 'tis to no purpoſe for a Man to ſtand on his Innocency, to plead his Merit, to ſeek to oblige or gain favour, to oppoſe ſtrength or intereſt in this Caſe. A Common Envy, like an Hurricane or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous Torrent, overturns and carries all before it; at leaſt it doth ſo for a time, till the Truth of things comes to be known by ſome woful experience; ſo that the Wiſe Man may well ask this Queſtion in my Text, <hi>Who is able to ſtand before Envy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus given you a Taſt of the Evil Nature of Envy, whereby we may perceive it to be the moſt violent and unruly of all the Paſſions, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the very worſt of all the Diſeaſes of Man's Mind: That we may the better avoid it in our ſelves, beware of it in others, and uſe proper Remedies to cure it, either in our ſelves or others, I ſhall,</p>
            <list>
               <item>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Endeavour to give a juſt Deſcription of it, that we may perfectly know it.</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Particularly ſet forth the uſual miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Effects of it, that we may the more hate and avoid it: And,</item>
               <item>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Propoſe ſuch Remedies as will effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually cure it; that ſo we may apply them, as we ſee occaſion. And,</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. To know what <hi>Envy</hi> is, we ſhall find, if we conſider it, That it is a Diſpleaſure or Trouble a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing in a Man's mind from the ſight or knowledge of another Perſon's proſperity, (of whatſoever ſort
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:65178:5"/>
that Proſperity be, whether it conſiſt in Reputation, Honour, Riches, or any other like advantage,) which cauſeth a man to hate the Perſon, whoſe Proſperity he beholds, and to wiſh and contrive and endeavour what he can to leſſen, if not to ruine that Perſon.</p>
            <p>And this commonly ariſes on the ſight of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity of Inferiours, or Equals.</p>
            <p>Men are Envious, when they ſee ſuch as they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted much their Inferiours, begin to draw near them; Or thoſe they accounted ſcarce their Equals get above them. And therefore <hi>Envy</hi> frequently breeds amongſt Relations, near Neighbours, or men of a like ſort. Men Envy that to others, which they think themſelves as well or better to deſerve.</p>
            <p>They ſeldom envy Things, that are far out of their Reach; or Perſons that are very much above them. As for Inſtance, a Peaſant or a mean Man never thinks of Envying the Greatneſs of Noblemen or Princes; But Nobles are envied by ſuch as come near them, and Monarchs only by thoſe of the ſame High Station, and that, by the way, gives an Advantage of peace and quiet to a Government that is under One; ſince if he takes care of his own Affairs, none can envy his Actions: Whereas, where many Govern, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours are almoſt upon the Level with the Subject, <hi>Envy</hi> creates endleſs ſtrife and contention.</p>
            <p>But, I ſay, <hi>Envy</hi> is amongſt them that at leaſt think themſelves of equal Merit and Pretenſions. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may obſerve in Hiſtory, That the Courſe which Wiſe Rulers have always taken to prevent this
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:65178:5"/>
miſchief, hath been with great Care to proportion Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to Merit. And tho' this hath not been always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do it, becauſe men are very partial Judges of their own merit, and ſome will ever be envious; yet this they found the beſt Expedient to keep <hi>ENVY</hi> from being propagated, or growing to a miſchievous Height; for if Envious men can do ſo much hurt, when they only take an occaſion, How much more will be in their power, when great Occaſions are given them?</p>
            <p>There is indeed a Commotion, that ariſes in Mens Hearts upon the like occaſion of ſeeing the Proſperity or Honour of another, which they think themſelves as capable of; that is very different from Envy, and is term'd by the Moraliſts <hi>Emulation</hi>; &amp; is that Vertue, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts to in thoſe words, <hi>Let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one another to provoke unto Love and to good Works, Heb.</hi> 10.24. Which doth not like Envy covet the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but the work too; and which hath always this great Difference to diſtinguiſh it from <hi>Envy,</hi> or thoſe Carnal <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which are ill Tranſlated <hi>Emulations</hi> in the 5<hi>th.</hi> of the <hi>Gal.</hi> that theſe are always joyn'd with Hatred and evil-Will; whereas the virtuous <hi>Emulation</hi> always creates <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Eſteem</hi> of the perſons whom we ſee in Honour and Proſperity, and a Deſire to imitate them, that by a like Induſtry and Virtue, we may come to the ſame advantages.</p>
            <p>We have a lively Inſtance of the difference of theſe two Qualities in <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Jonathan</hi> upon the very ſame occaſion of <hi>David</hi>'s killing <hi>Goliah. Saul,</hi> we ſee, envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for that great Action, and therefore hated and ſought to deſtroy him; but <hi>Jonathan</hi> on the contrary
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65178:6"/>
emulated his Vertue, and therefore lov'd and admir'd the man, and deſired to make him his Friend; and yet the Fame that <hi>David</hi> got by this Action, was no more, nay, rather leſs oppoſite to the Intereſt of <hi>Saul,</hi> whom <hi>David</hi> was never like to hurt, than it was to the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of <hi>Jonathan</hi> the Heir of his Father's Crown.</p>
            <p>There is then a wide Difference between noble Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and wicked Envy; the One of which ought to be rooted out, and the other cheriſh'd and cultivated as much as is poſſible; becauſe it is the Spring and Riſe of all Noble and Worthy Actions, and that on which all good <hi>Example</hi> works, and no great Genius was ever yet found without a great deal of Emulation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his Lives gives us two Notable Examples of the powerful working of Emulation in the hearts of two Famous Captains, <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> among the Greeks, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> among the Romans. He relates that <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtocles</hi> complain'd to his Friends, that the Victory of <hi>Miltiades</hi> wou'd not ſuffer him to ſleep; And <hi>Caeſar,</hi> when he read the Actions of <hi>Alexander,</hi> wept to think he was paſt his Age before he had done any thing memorable. Theſe great Men had no ill Will to the perſons they emulated; nor did they go about to leſſen, but rather magnify'd their Deeds; and never griev'd that others did well, but that they had not done the like themſelves.</p>
            <p>Such a Gallant Emulation we often read of in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our Anceſtors, and cannot but wiſh that the ſame Noble Spirit might revive again, when there is ſo much occaſion for it, and theſe want not ſome great and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Examples to kindle it. For how much more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable were it for men to emulate one another in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:65178:6"/>
Actions for the Defence of their Country, than to ſpend their time in the little Intriegues of envy?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Emulation</hi> is a Great &amp; a Noble Virtue, but <hi>Envy</hi> a poor and a ſneaking Vice: A Vice that always ſculks &amp; hides it ſelf: For tho' men are ſometimes ſo wicked as to boaſt and glory in other Vices, yet no man will own him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be envious, which ſhews it to be an Infamous Quality in the eyes of all Men. A Man is afraid to be found in it, aſham'd to own it. And therefore an envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man uſes great Art to hide and colour his envy, and to make it look like ſomething elſe: Sometimes he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes it under a Mighty pretended Zeal for the Truth, ſometimes under a great Love for the publick Good and Welfare, ſometimes under a Charitable Concern and great Tenderneſs for the Good or Credit of his Neighbour, whom he ſeems to pity, whilſt he diſpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; and, if you will believe Men's pretences, there is not a man living that has the leaſt Envy in him. And yet if we enquire into the certain marks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and undoubted ſymptoms of this Vice, we ſhall hardly find any man wholly free from it; for if a man is griev'd or troubled, when he hears of another's good Succeſs; if he finds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Delight in his mind, when he hears of any Diſgrace or Misfortune, that hath befallen his Neighbour; if he loves to hear of the weakneſs or miſcarriages of thoſe that are in proſperity; if he is glad to have an ill thing to tell of them; if he is out of Humour, when he hears their praiſe or commendation; if in relating their Actions he ſlily endeavours to leſſen them, or when he does commend them, puts in ſtill ſome malicious Buts or Exceptions; if, as the Apoſtle in few Words expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes all this, <hi>A man rejoyces in Iniquity, and not in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65178:7"/>
Truth.</hi> In iniquity, that is, to the Diſgrace of any Perſon, and not in the Truth, that is to his advantage, That Man is certainly Envious. And how few then are wholly free from this Vice? In ſome indeed it grows to a moſt wicked and pernicious Height: but in all that have not wholly mortified their carnal Affections (amongſt whith S. <hi>Paul</hi> reckons this) there is ſome Taint of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, according to the words of St. <hi>James,</hi> ch. 4. v. 5. <hi>Do ye think that the Scripture ſaith in vain, The Spirit that dwelleth in us, luſteth to Envy?</hi> Without the powerful Grace of God to pluck it up, this Root of bitterneſs will grow in the hearts of all the Corrupt Children of <hi>Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have ſeen then what envy is, Let us in the</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>d.</hi> Place take a view of the uſual miſchievous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of it, and ſee what Abundance of Evil it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly does in the world; that we may be the more ſet againſt it, that we may avoid it our ſelves, that we may beware of it in others, that we may uſe our utmoſt endeavours to quench this Flame, to diſpatch this <hi>Hydra,</hi> to ſhut up this <hi>Pandora</hi>'s Box, out of which miſcheif hath and doth continually fly over all the Earth, according to the words of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>Where Envy is, there is confuſion, and every evil Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For if we conſult Hiſtories, either Sacred or Civil, or the experience of any obſerving men, we ſhall find, that there hath been no Diſturbance in the ſtate, no Hereſy or Schiſm in the Church, no trouble in any little Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood or private Family, but it is chiefly owing to envy.</p>
            <p>In the State, when one man is advanc'd to any Place of Truſt, or Dignity, or Profit, preſently thoſe that
<pb facs="tcp:65178:7"/>
think themſelves as capable, or as deſerving as he, raiſe a clamour, ſeek to diſparage, endeavour to oppoſe him, lay plots for his Downfal and Ruin; and that many times for no other Reaſon, but becauſe the man has obtain'd what they would gladly have had themſelves. For a man that has ſo many Vices, that they cannot be reckon'd up, when once he has a little got the ſtart of his Neighbours in his Fortune, had been as good and as innocent a man as any one living, if he had continued upon the ſame Level with them, and joyn'd in their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Calumnies againſt others: But having got above them, they diſparage, they hate, they endeavour to thwart him in all things, tho' it be to the hind'rance and detriment of the Publick Intereſt. In which, tho' they themſelves have a common ſtake; Yet envy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times ſo blinds mens eyes, that they will rather hurt themſelves, injure the common Good and Safety, ruine their Native Country, hazard all that is dear or preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, rather than not do what they can to pull down and deſtroy thoſe whom they envy.</p>
            <p>And as envy hath and doth work continually ſuch Confuſion in the State, ſo it hath no leſs been a Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Peace of the Church.</p>
            <p>For though the Scriptures of the New Teſtament are full of Precepts againſt envy, ſuch as that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 5.26. <hi>Let us not be deſirous of Vain Glory, provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another, envying one another.</hi> And though our Bleſſed Saviour, both by his example and precept, taught all Chriſtians not to ſeek Earthly, but Heavenly Riches and Honours, (the way to which could never be the ſame with that by which Satan fell from them) and tho' he gave to the Miniſters of his Church the greateſt Caution againſt vain Ambition, and would have thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:65178:8"/>
that are in the Higheſt Station be moſt humble and meek, and as officious to do good, as if they were the leaſt, and ſervants of all, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.35. Yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, becauſe no Society can conſiſt without Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and there can be no Government without Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bordination; for there is no Authority, and there can be no obedience, amongſt thoſe that are in all Reſpects equal; therefore our Lord himſelf did conſtitute diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Orders; he ordained Apoſtles, whoſe Office is in the 1<hi>ſt.</hi> of the <hi>Acts,</hi> called a Biſhoprick; He likewiſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd Elders, who were not of ſo great Authority as the Apoſtles; and the Apoſtles, who were endued with Power from on high, ordained Deacons, all the Orders we now retain. Now, becauſe Authority is that which all ambitious and worldly-minded men do ſeek; and it is impoſſible that any Church, or any Society here on earth, ſhould be without any worldly-minded men in it: Thence hath ariſen the Diſturbance of the Peace of the Church, there have been men like <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> whom we read of in the 3d. Epiſtle of <hi>John,</hi> ver. 9. who <hi>lov'd Preeminence,</hi> and therefore envyed the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it by any other Perſons; and as it is at the Tenth Verſe, firſt began to prate againſt them, and then made Diviſions from them</p>
            <p>This in all Ages of the Church, if we look into Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, we ſhall find to be the firſt and chief Cauſe of all Hereſies, Sects and Schiſms. There were men that would fain have had the Preeminence, that were very angry that it fell to other mens Lots; and ſo firſt prated againſt them, and then made Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions from them. Thus of Old, the <hi>Novation, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natist, Arrian,</hi> and many other both Schiſms and He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65178:8"/>
began: And therefore we muſt not think ſtrange, if we ſee ſuch things happen again in our Age. We have ſeen the effects of this, not only in Diviſions in the Church, but alſo in Sub-diviſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Dividers themſelves. For when a Proud man has made himſelf Head of a Sect, others of the ſame Sect, as Proud as he, have Envy'd that his Preeminence, and divided from him to make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chief of other Sects, and in their turn have felt the ſame effect of Envy. For let men talk what they will of Parity or Equality, it is utterly impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible in any Society or Company that hold together, but that there will and muſt be ſome that will be more Eminent, and that will bear a greater ſway than others, and in effect Govern; and whereſoever there is Superiority, that will be a But of Envy, and that Envy will be the Cauſe of Diviſion; and Sub-divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are the eaſieſt things in the world, becauſe there is neither Authority nor Argument to reſtrain them, but what had been rejected before by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viders. So that if God ſhould leave Human Nature to it ſelf, as long as there is ſuch a thing as Envy in it, there could be no Church-Government, there could be no Unity in the World.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſpoken of the Diſturbance of Church and State that is given by Envy, I need ſay nothing of that Trouble and Vexation, that flood of Evil ſpeaking, of Evil ſurmiſing, the multitude of Feuds and Quarrels, that Envy begets in every little Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, in every private Family; ſince mens too common experience of this, to their Coſt, will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently excuſe me from enlarging upon this Point;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:65178:9"/>
and indeed we have no Relation in Hiſtory, Sacred or Civil, of the private Affairs of any Family, but we find therein ſome dreadful Marks of Envy.</p>
            <p>And to what end is all this Miſchief done by En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Men? What do they get by it? There is certainly a great deal of Labour, in contriving, in proſecuting, and yet hiding Envious Deſigns. There is much pain and anguiſh to the Envious Man, not only from a ſenſe of the Guilt of his Sin, but in the Sin it ſelf, beſides the puniſhment he muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect hereafter, which can be no other than what is inflicted upon the Devils, his Sin being the ſame with theirs.</p>
            <p>Envy is alſo its own Puniſhment; a Puniſhment ſo great, that when a man becomes extreamly Envious, it even pines him away, it waſtes his fleſh, conſumes his bones, eats his very heart; ſo that no man can find a greater Torment for a very Envious Man, than he inflicts upon himſelf. And what profit, I ſay, hath he for all this pain? His Envy is not only a diſcouragement to Worthy Men in the doing of their Duty, when they find ſo much ill-will for their pains; but is alſo an hinderance to himſelf, from treading in their ſteps, and taking the ſame Courſe to Vertue, and the Rewards of it: For when he has reproach'd others, he is aſham'd, and too proud to imitate them; for which Reaſon <hi>Job</hi> charges the Envious with folly, as well as wickedneſs, ſaying, <hi>Envy ſlayeth the ſilly one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe a Crafty Envy may ſometime obtain its purpoſe, and pull down the man aim'd at; 'tis
<pb facs="tcp:65178:9"/>
but ſeldom that the Perſon, whoſe Envy chiefly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd this, has the fortune to ſtep into his Place; or if he does, the Envy that he propagated againſt his Predeceſſor, often becomes as troubleſome to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when he arrives at the ſame ſtation; and ſo the Envious Man is very good at overturning or deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing, but at building or ſettling of nothing.</p>
            <p>But ſince <hi>Envy</hi> is ſuch a Plague to all the Earth, ſuch a Diſturbance to Society, ſuch a Breeder of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content and Faction in the State, ſuch a never-ceaſing Cauſe of Schiſm and Diviſion in the Church: It is a Wonder, ſome Man may ſay, that the good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God endures Envious Men upon the face of the Earth, that the Divine Juſtice does not, as it did once in the Caſe of the Envious <hi>Levites,</hi> ſend them all down quick to thoſe evil Spirits, whom they ſo nearly reſemble, and not ſuffer them to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble this earth any longer.</p>
            <p>But this is an Objection to be made by ſuch as do not underſtand or conſider the ſtate of this preſent Life: We ought to know that this is an imperfect State, wherein evil muſt be mixt with good, of which there can be a perfect ſeparation onely in the future Life; that it is, as it were, the ſtate of Infancy to good Men, who muſt be bred up here as Children in a School, for the ſtate of Perfection; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore here they muſt paſs through many Tryals and difficult Methods of Diſcipline and Improvement, amongſt which, the <hi>Envy</hi> both of Men and Devils, as 'tis manag'd by the Wiſe Providence of God, who can bring good out of evil, may very well be reckon'd for one.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65178:10"/>For Firſt, All Men are very apprehenſive of ſhame and diſgrace, to which the Envious ſtand ready, and are watchful, to expoſe men on any fault or miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage; and this doubtleſs keeps many Perſons from being ſo bad as otherwiſe they would be.</p>
            <p>Again; The beſt Men are but weak and frail, and the ſnares of the Devil manifold; ſo that by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding one ſin, we often run into another; and the moſt perfect Men on earth, if they do not erre on the left hand, yet are apt to erre on the right, to fall into ſome unreaſonable extreme or other: And good Men, when they have attain'd to any excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, are apt to be puft up with ſome degree of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and in ſome ſort to deſpiſe and contemn others, and to become more remiſs in their own Duties. And theſe Faults, though they cannot ſee in themſelves, and the kindneſs of their Friends makes them over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look them, and perhaps Flatterers may commend as Vertues; yet the quick ſight of the Envious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſcovers them, and they blow them up into great Crimes, and blaze them abroad, ſo that Men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves can be no longer ignorant of their faults.</p>
            <p>And again, Though the Envious do often Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate the beſt Men, yet they never directly Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate them for their Vertues, but they find out ſome fault, or at leaſt ſome appearance or probability of a fault to Calumniate withal: As we read in the Firſt of <hi>Job,</hi> the Devil, when he could not find any diſobedience to charge <hi>Job</hi> with, charg'd him with worldly and ſelf-ends in his obedience: So Envious Men, who are the Devil's moſt apt Scholars, never
<pb facs="tcp:65178:10"/>
plainly reproach a Man for his Piety, Juſtice, or Charity, Prudence or Diligence, Temperance or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, though it be for the Reputation and Rewards of theſe, that they envy him; but they will charge him with Vain glory, or Hypocriſie, or Self-endedneſs, or the like: And if they can find the leaſt Colour of any of theſe Vices; they take this for a Diſcovery, and magnifie it to the uttermoſt. So that in effect, Envious Men are the moſt curious and exact Cenſors of Manners; they keep the World in a great deal of Awe, and are oftentimes our trueſt Friends to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to us thoſe faults which otherwiſe we ſhould have over-look'd. They make us circumſpect in every Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and I believe, a great many may ſay by experience, That the <hi>Envy</hi> of their Enemies (though it is no thank to them) hath contributed more to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and the perfecting of their Manners, than all the kindneſs of their Friends. This good uſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of <hi>Envy,</hi> though in it ſelf a very wicked thing, and dwelling only in the moſt wicked hearts, the All-wiſe and Over-ruling Providence of God doth make; and every wiſe and good Man ought to make this Advantage of others <hi>Envy,</hi> he ought to grow the more careful and circumſpect in all his ways, and ſo to profit thereby.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the generality of the World are not wiſe, and the beſt Men on earth are but imperfectly ſo; therefore, when Envious Men raiſe ſlanders, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive evil devices againſt thoſe they Envy, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons envyed are apt to retort them, to render evil for evil, and the ſtanders-by take part with the one ſide or the other, according as their <hi>Envy</hi> or other Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb facs="tcp:65178:11"/>
incline them; and ſo Quarrels are inflam'd, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are form'd, and it often ends in War and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. The beſt way then to prevent ſo much Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, as <hi>Envy</hi> uſually brings into the World, is to uſe what means we can to cure this evil Diſeaſe in Mens Minds, which is the</p>
            <p>Laſt Enquiry, What are the proper Remedies for this Diſeaſe? And there are Four ſufficient and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Remedies, if we will but carefully ſeek and Apply them. The</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt is, <hi>A Right Apprehenſion of the Nature of the things of this World, a true <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Value of them.</hi> The</item>
               <item>Second, <hi>A Due Submiſſion to the Will of God in all things.</hi> The</item>
               <item>Third, <hi>A True Humility.</hi> And the</item>
               <item>Fourth, <hi>A Chriſtian Charity.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. Then, A true underſtanding of the Nature, and the Value of the things of this preſent world, will be a powerfull Remedy againſt <hi>Envy</hi>; For indeed, when Vertuous and Worthy men are envied, it is not for their Vertue, but it is for thoſe worldly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which they get by it. As for Vertue it ſelf, 'tis in every mans power: He may have it if he will go to the Coſt. But thoſe Advantages which are the Rewards of it, are commonly in the Power of others. And men do not grieve for want of that, which it is in their own power to have, but for want
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:65178:11"/>
of that, which it is in the power of others to give. This is plain in the Inſtance I mention'd of <hi>Cain</hi>'s en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vying his Brother; for God told him, that he need not be caſt down, ſince he might do well and be accepted; But he had no mind to do well, and yet he had a Mind to be Accepted, and to have the Benefit of it; ſo that he envyed not his Brother's Goodneſs, which he might have had, if he pleas'd, but he envied God's Acceptance of him, and the Bleſſings that were like to follow thereupon. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, in that other memorable Inſtance of the <hi>Envy</hi> of <hi>Saul</hi> gainſt <hi>David; Saul</hi> envyed not <hi>David</hi>'s Courage in venturing to go againſt <hi>Goliah,</hi> for that he might have had himſelf; he might have gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Champion then, or afterwards againſt any of his Gygantick Bretheren, but <hi>Saul</hi> envyed the praiſe, that <hi>David</hi> got by this, when the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men celebrated his Valour in their Songs, ſaying, Saul <hi>hath ſlain his Thouſands, but</hi> David <hi>his Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands.</hi> He was very willing that <hi>David</hi> ſhou'd have the Fighting, but he wou'd fain have had the praiſe.</p>
            <p>Now, beſides that it is moſt unjuſt, that the work and the reward ſhou'd be ſeperated, or that they ſhould deſire the one, that have no mind to the other: I ſay beſides this, if men wou'd but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what there is in popular praiſe, in worldly Wealth or Greatneſs, they wou'd find them ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and improper to give true Content or Satisfaction to man's Mind; ſo uncertain alſo, for they do not alwayes happen to thoſe that beſt deſerve them; and if it be our hap to obtain them, they can be ours but ſo little a while; that a wiſe man wou'd
<pb facs="tcp:65178:12"/>
hardly ſpend one anxious or ſolicitous thought about them, much leſs torment his mind with ſo grievous and ſore a paſſion (as <hi>Envy</hi> is) for them: Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when that more ſubſtantial good of doing well, and performing our Duty, and what becomes us in all Circumſtances, is always within our Reach and Power, the Grace of God waiting continually to aſſiſt us therein; and this, beſides the unconceivable Comfort every good and generous mind muſt feel therein, will entitle us to Rewards, that are not empty, uncertain, and tranſitory, but unſpeakably Happy and Eternal. The</p>
            <p n="2">2. Remedy againſt <hi>Envy,</hi> is a dutiful Submiſſion to the will and pleaſure of God, by whoſe providence all things here below are order'd and diſpos'd. If we conſider how much it is our duty to ſubmit to him, whoſe all things are, and even we our ſelves, (and he cannot but have a juſt Title to do whatſoever he will with his own) we can never have an evil or an envious Eye at the Proſperity of any of our Brethren. For even this is wholly the Gift of God; So the Scripture ſaith, The Lord maketh rich, and maketh poor, he lifteth up and caſteth down; and How dares man then, by his <hi>Envy,</hi> cenſure the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his Maker, or ſay unto God, <hi>What doeſt thou?</hi> He hath wiſe Reaſons for all his Doings, tho' we ſometimes are not able to find them out. We know not the meaning of His Providence oftentimes, and why then ſhou'd we preſume to judge it? For we cannot, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays in the 9. of <hi>Eccles.</hi> ver 1. <hi>Judge either of God</hi>'s <hi>Love or Hatred, by the things that are before us,</hi> by the diſpoſal of worldly Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; for worldly Goods are not always Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,
<pb facs="tcp:65178:12"/>
and God may in Judgment and Anger ſuffer ſome to be rich and great in this Moment of Life, whilſt others, whom he loves better, may be mean and deſpis'd. Even, according to Natural Reaſon, and the Judgment of the Philoſophers, thoſe that are term'd the good things of this World, are not good in themſelves, but as they are us'd: A wiſe and good Man will be ſure to uſe them well, and he were an ill Man that would envy him any thing. But Riches or Honours heap'd upon a fool, or a wicked man, are rather a Miſchief than a Benefit to him: They make him but more remarkably fooliſh, they greaten and ſhew his faults more advantageouſly, and in a clearer light, they alſo blow up and inflame his Luſts and Paſſions: For either they lead him into Pride and Vanity, Ryot and Exceſs, and ſo there is a quick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch both of the Man and his Fortune together; or elſe Covetouſneſs ſeizeth him, and renders all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance uſeleſs to him, and fear of loſing what he has, keeps him always in anxiety. Now who would envy a man in ſuch a ſtate of miſery? This may cure <hi>Envy</hi> in the worſt natur'd man living. How much more, if we conſider what the end of all this is like to be? God may ſuffer wicked men to proſper in this World, to fill up the meaſure of their Iniquities; or they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving plac'd their happineſs in earthly things, he may in Judgment make them all their portion, as <hi>Abraham</hi> told
<pb facs="tcp:65178:13"/>
               <hi>Dives,</hi> they had been his. God may ſuffer them, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>ch.</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>To ſpend their days in wealth, and in a moment to go down into the Grave:</hi> Nay, below the Grave, to a Place, as <hi>David</hi> tells us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.19. where they are conſum'd with Terrors. And is this a Condition to be envyed? Who can envy a moments folly, that muſt end in never-ceaſing Torment and Miſery?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Humility is alſo an Effectual Remedy againſt <hi>Envy</hi>: For <hi>Envy</hi> ariſes from Pride, Self love, and Self-conceit; and a man is never envious, who has humble thoughts of himſelf: He that looks carefully into his own Infirmities and Failings, will have but little heart to be ambitious or envious, or to cenſure others; he will find it ſo neceſſary to judge himſelf, that he will never think of judging his Neighbour; and ſeeing plainly how much weakneſs he himſelf might be lyable to, if he were in place or power; he will be ſo far from envying others Advancement, that he will be glad, that he himſelf is not ſet in ſo ſlippery a place, where he knows not, whether he ſhould be able to ſtand upright. It is therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Advice, that is given by the wiſe Son of <hi>Syrach, Seek not to be Judge, not being able to take away Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> And if men would impartially examine their own fitneſs for the Stations they envy others, they
<pb facs="tcp:65178:13"/>
might eaſily cure themſelves of this troubleſome Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) men neither <hi>meaſuring</hi> nor <hi>comparing</hi> themſelves, as they ought, are not wiſe, but fall into many fooliſh and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Luſts and Paſſions.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, A true Chriſtian Charity is a moſt effectual Remedy againſt <hi>Envy</hi>; For this pluks it up by the very Roots, and plants in our Hearts what is moſt contrary thereunto. For he, that truly loves his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, can never <hi>Envy</hi> him, ſo ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty envyeth not.</hi> He, that loves his Neighbour as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Nay, that accounts his Neighbour to be him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, (for ſo the Apoſtles Words imply, <hi>Ye are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers one of another,</hi> Rom. 12.5. And again, <hi>Ye are one Body,</hi> 1 Cor. 10 17.) will be ſo far from envy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or repining at any good, that happens to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he will find a ſenſible Joy and Delight there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; according to the Words of the Apoſtle, 1 Cor. 12.26. <hi>If one member be honour'd, all the members rejoyce with it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a wonderful Alteration, that true Charity (if it once take poſſeſſion of a mans heart) maketh in all the Paſſions and Affections of his mind. For nothing in our Brethren can be grievous to us, when we have Charity: Nothing can, but what is an Evill to them, and that alſo moves Compaſſion, and not Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65178:14"/>
not only Hatred and Malice, and <hi>Envy,</hi> and all thoſe troubleſom and tormenting Paſſions, are utterly baniſh'd out of our hearts by Charity; but our hearts are thereby mightily enlarged; Our Joy and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light are made more Noble and more Abundant; we have a Spiritual and Rational Delight inſtead of that, which is ſenſual and brutiſh, to which a man, that has a baſe Self-love, is only confin'd; neither is our Joy ſo poor and narrow, as to be limited within the Compaſs of one Particular. But he whoſe Heart is enlarg'd with Charity, partakes of Joy in all mens Happineſs, which he accounts his own, becauſe they are dear to him, and of the ſame Body. For as a man, that has natural Affection, rejoyces in the Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of his Children, or near Relations; or he, that hath a true ſence of friendſhip, reioyces in the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of his Friend; ſo a truly Charitable man, that accounts himſelf nearly related, and a friend to all men, rejoyces in any good that happens to any man, if it be indeed a good to him.</p>
            <p>By planting this Noble Charity then amongſt men, our Bleſſed Saviour hath countermin'd all the devices of Satan, hath deſtroy'd the works of the Devil, which he chiefly promoted and carried on by <hi>Envy.</hi> And as the Devil by <hi>Envy</hi> firſt diſturb'd Heaven it ſelf, and hath ſince wrought all manner of miſchief
<pb facs="tcp:65178:14"/>
and Confuſion in the Earth, ſo our Bleſſed Saviour on the contrary, by Charity, of which himſelf was the Greateſt and Nobleſt Example, and which he hath made his Chief Commandment, and taken the greateſt care to inſtruct us in, and preſs upon us, hath reſtor'd all things, hath eſtabliſh'd the Bleſſed Angels in their Happy State, hath given Peace on Earth, and put us into a Capacity, if we continually walk in Charity, of coming to the ſame unalterable ſtate of Glory and Happineſs, that the Holy Angels are in; of coming to thoſe Regions of Bliſs and Joy, where all Rejoyce in one anothers Felicity; where mutual Love, and moſt ſincere kindneſs, makes the Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all that Glorious Society, the Bleſſedneſs of every particular Member of it; where being moſt nearly united together in the moſt intimate concern for one another, in the ſtraiteſt Bond of Friendſhip, and having, as it were, but one Mind and one Soul, they partake of one common and unexpreſſible Joy together.</p>
