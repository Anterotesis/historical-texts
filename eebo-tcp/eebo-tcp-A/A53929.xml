            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Ingenious READER.</head>
            <p>WHen the Wisedome, Prudence, and Learning, of Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi> lively depainted in his Booke entituled <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to a Son,</hi> had five times been invested with the <hi>Trabea Triumphali,</hi> the honourable Robe of universal applause, we had lesse reason than the female instructer hath braines, to suspect an <hi>Homero-mastix,</hi> one that durst malepertly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deovour by the interposition of his opacous and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous conceptions, to eclipse the splendour of such an eminent Author.</p>
            <p>Had any Man of Learning and Modesty throwne downe his Gantlet in defiance of some particulars, referring to study, Travail, Government, Religion, or perhaps like a Knight Errant in defence of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies seemingly wrong'd, my Pen should still have retain'd its quiet repose, and onely my wishes have supplyed the place of Heralds, to search the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, least instead of the Sword of Truth, he should wound his Antagonist with the unlawfull weapon of Malice, lent him by her Sister Vainglory. But
<pb facs="tcp:61739:3"/>
since the Master of <hi>Gotham Colledge,</hi> a grand proficient in <hi>Bacchus</hi>'s Schoole, and meriting to be chiefe professour of <hi>Billings-Gate</hi> begins to bark, I shall (he being far unworthy of Mr. <hi>Osborn</hi>'s Lash) muzle him, and thank my auspicious for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, if in requitall of my journy to fetch him Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebore, I might pluck Narcissus, the Secretary of God and Nature, (as he stiles himselfe) from a fond admiration of the Chymaeraes of his owne braine.</p>
            <p>He will brag perhaps that I durst not affix my Name to these my castgations of his <hi>Advice to a Daughter;</hi> and very true, for if a Cedar in literature be a namelesse overworn wittall, what may a shrub whose<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> highest honour is onely to be a lover of such, expect? I for my part e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme it little wit, and lesse breeding, to use such dirty language as he delights in, which a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man should abhor to vent, when a just offence hath blown his possion into a flame,</p>
            <p>Yet he shall finde me so favourable as to interpret what is dubious to the best sense, and to let every thing passe for weight, which wound up in candour, shall proove equally ponderous to one graine of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. the Author often boasts, that this his Gourd sprang up in Sixteen dayes, I may truly affirme that what you see, was but the employment of a few vacant houres.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:61739:3"/>Let your candid approbation <hi>(Courteous READER)</hi> second me whilest I fight this great Gyant, whose thundring name would affright many, although nothing is able to terrifie me; but a non-permission to subscribe your ready Servant,</p>

                  <q>In opposition to the Advice to a Sonne.</q>
                  <p>Your opposition is onely culpable in this, that such a Pygmy as you, wage war with an Eagle in stead of a Crane.</p>

                  <q>Under these generall heads.<lb/> 1 Studies.</q>
                  <p>What shall your Daughter be a Minerva, or rather a Pope Jone, for she must it seemes be a Student, and your first two heads treat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Free-Schooles, and Universities, that there wants nothing but the pretty little Elixar, and then Squire <hi>Rosa-Crucian</hi> the trick is done.</p>
                  <q>2 Marriage.</q>
                  <p>Any that we will allowe, let them have their longing.</p>
                  <q>3 Travell.</q>
                  <p>Your Daughter must be a gossip forsooth, but let her travell we shall not want any of your breed, and perhaps by diligent enquiry, she may find out and transport her Fathers wits; which have so long been a wool gathering in <hi>Spaine,</hi> or at least in <hi>Vino Hispanico,</hi> and are now fallen under the inquisition.</p>

A woman shall not need to make <hi>Machiavel</hi> her sampler: And tis the priviledge of the weaker Vessels to lie at ancre in safe Harbours, whilest men, the serviceable ships of war frequently sinke one another, by the impetuous firing of open violence; or give chase, untill the quick sands of dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and envy, glory in the wrack of the now transparent carrick.</p>
                  <q>5 Religion.</q>
                  <p>Let serious study first embroyder your own soul, with the eleven morall vertues, resolutely solicit Heaven untill you obtain the three Christian graces, Faith, Hope, and charity: Then when your soul shall be a pure fountain, I shan't resist, that all your daughters should zealously imbibe your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious precepts.</p>
                  <q>Conclusion.</q>
                  <p>I am glad your Book shall have an end although sorry that you should stagger six
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61739:6"/>
miles in such a difficult road, where your despicable wit, and indiscernable learning know scarce one step of the way, yet you are sure of fit company, if the Adage be true, <hi>Stultorum omnia plena.</hi> But it matters not when your book ends, for a few lines will make the Reader weary, and inable him to conclude, what both it and the Author are; that is to say none of the wisest. And if there be any one misdoubts it, let him or her rather (for 'tis the advice to a dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghter,) open, and they may at the first search receive an undeniable demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration.</p>

if your Patron instead of every way, be but any way accomplished, you never spake truer, then when you said I trouble you.</p>
                  <q>It is no laboured piece,</q>
                  <p>That's easily granted,</p>
                  <q>And indeed no fit present!</q>
                  <p>That's right, unlesse it be to <hi>Dunne</hi> Lord of Tyburn, who by way of requitall, may for the small sum of thirteen pence halfpeny, added as a gratuitie, make you tenant for life of his tri-angular patrimony.</p>
                  <q>But I begge your acceptance,</q>
                  <p>you may

                  <p>may be so, but had'st thou had but half the conference with the starres, that <hi>Nic.

                     <p>Advice to a Daughter.</p>
                     <p>Who is this that darkneth Knowledge by Words without understanding?</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>I answer, <hi>Iohn Heydon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>Come thou Embrio of an History, thou Cadet of a Pamphleteer.</q>
                  <p>Why thou Geoffrey in swabberslops, thou little Negro mounted on the Elephant of thy owne Folly, you and I will be sure to write something Authentick, as long as we can steale from Mr. <hi>Cleeveland</hi>'s Diurnall-Maker.</p>
                  <q>And now I thinke upon it, I will allow thee time to Breath.</q>
                  <p>Bravely resolved, a Noble Enemy is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies courteous.</p>
                  <q>It speaks like a Man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Then by your own confession it is rational.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:61739:13"/>It is the first tincture and Rudiments of a Writer, dipped as yet in the preparative Blew, like an Almanack Well-willer.</q>
                  <p>Our Gentleman likes Mr. <hi>Cleeveland</hi>'s en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment so well, that he is come againe for the other Dish, and falls on like a most undaunted Plagiarie. Send out an Hue and Crye, and you will overtake him in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of a Characteriz'd Diurnall-Maker.</p>
                  <q>Behold his directions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>Under the five generall Heads I will cut off, and you will think him the Tripple-headed Porter of Hell.</p>
                  <p>Alas Sir, that you should forget to make a Commentary in Folio upon this Mysticall Expression: Your Enemies five Heads shall be cut off, <hi>Ergo</hi> the leaving Him no Heads, is the way to make him Tripple-Headed. If Little <hi>David</hi> (as you style your selfe) stumbles thus upon Non-sence, the Ladies may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a sad Omen, that their Champion may chance not to kill great <hi>Goliah.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>I scorn to kill him, I'le onely box Bim, Kick, and Cudgell him for his boldnesse.</q>
                  <p>You scorn to kill him; Oh shew me the like favour, and let us both Live to make Panegyricks of your Clemency, yet
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61739:13"/>
we are couragious; Against your Cudgell wee'le furbish our old rusty Back-sword, and since you are Nettled, you shall have leave to Kick. And let him know, he is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Man, who hath besiedged and taken a Towne; not plotted to rob an Orchard.</p>
                  <q>The robbing of an Orchard was not attributed to the better Man, but to the craftier Boy. But whither you are that better Man that besiedged and tooke a Towne, I'le not dispute: However, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out question since you wrote this Excellent Piece, the Towne hath beene your owne.</q>

                  <q>Para. <hi>1.</hi>Here, Hee complaines of the losse of those times, which I could wish I had not known.</q>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Osburn</hi> complaines of losing the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his most docil time, but you see our Author loves not Learning so well, as to thinke his most docil time worth taking notice of. Then he runs from the Sence of his Antagonist, and lends his Daughter an Use of Instruction, which he borrowed himselfe.</p>
                  <q>2 I believe our much use of Srong Beer,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61739:14"/>
and grosse flesh, is a great occasion of dreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging our Spirits and corrupting them, till they shorten life.</q>
                  <p>You may believe him, for <hi>Experientia docet Ebrios, aequÃ¨ ac Stultos.</hi>Experience is the Mistresse of Ale-adorers, as well as of Fooles. And those grosser fumes corrupting the Spirits are the probable cause why his Stile is so languishing, and Booke-short-Liv'd.</p>
                  <q>Weigh every Mans Education as his meanes have been.</q>
                  <p>If you were as Rationall in every thing as in this, you had saved me the trouble of Animadversions: It is indeed in vaine to expect the modestly-blushing-Roses, and the dapled Gilliflowres, vapouring with their double and treble diadems, in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated Field, which an affected neglect of the despairing Tenant, hath dedicated to Bryars, Nettles, and the contemptible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Thorns and Thistles.</p>
                  <q>3 Besides, if I must describe a meer Scholler, he is an Intelligible Asse, or a sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Eellow in Black.</q>
                  <p>Must I? must <hi>Sir Thomas Overbury,</hi> you should have said? from whom without so much as
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61739:14"/>
mention of his Name, you impudently steale a whole Leafe: See over Character of a meere Scholler.</p>
                  <q>4 There is no Syntax betwixt a Cap of Maintenance, and an Helmet.</q>
                  <p>What's the reason, but because most Men like Hacknyes, can't endure to goe out of their Usuall Road? for if a Scholler durst as well read the lines Engraven in Men's Foreheads, as those written in Cassick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors; He (being not only Gold Ore, as he is a Scholler, but refined Gold, as having learn'd to exchange <hi>Probo quod Non.</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory humour, into <hi>Sir I kisse your Hand,</hi> a Politick and Submissive complyance) would become fit to receive the impresse of supream Authority; Being Stampt with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour on the forepart, and bearing on the Ranverse Regall Favour and Munificency.</p>
                  <p>5 Here he fancies the Habit of the <hi>Iesuites.</hi> This is without controversie, that what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarily good may and ought to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, let whose will be the Professours, Even pur-blinde <hi>Pagans,</hi> and the more barbarous <hi>Turks.</hi> And although some Fellowes of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, have more Pride than Learning, yet since they are as petty Magistrates, their Place commands Reverence from Inferiours.</p>
                  <q>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:61739:15"/>6 Here he would have his Son make some inspection into Physick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>It is implanted in all Men by Nature to desire long life; And consequently, his Society must be acceptable, who is supposed a fit Embassadour, to perswade a League be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the four Elements, that they may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animously concurre in resisting Death, their common and Fatal Enemie.</p>
                  <p>The seventh is tollerable.</p>
                  <q>8 Idle Bookes (like you Naturall Knave and Artificiall Dissembler) are nothing else but corrupted Tables, in Ink and Paper.</q>
                  <p>What still more of the Beere-Warders Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect? I must confesse your foul-mouth'd Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolts can't be retorted; For you are no Naturall Knave, although a Naturall Foole, and you are no Artificiall Dissembler, although you be an In-arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall Slanderer, and so long you are safe.</p>
                  <q>Our Law makes no difference betwixt the Thiefe and the Receiver.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Then wo be to them who buy your Bookes, where there is so much stoln.</p>
                  <q>His foolish Sentences dropt upon Paper in his <hi>Advice to a Son,</hi> hath set folly on an Hill, and is a Monument to make Women infamous Eternally.</q>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="23" facs="tcp:61739:15"/>
                     <hi>I Answer,</hi> They are wise Sentences; but onely when they stand in competition for the Garland with yours; But without an Ironie, I take leave to suspect you looked through the Vitiated <hi>Medium</hi> of your own stupendious Ignorance, when you saw his Folly upon an Hill, for if it were so evident, some other should have seene it as well as you, And if it be folly, (<hi>Te ipso Iudice</hi>) it is as long liv'd as the greatest Wisdom; for it is an Eternall Monument, although not to make Women infamous.</p>
                  <q>9 Would you know what kinde of Stuffe this is?</q>
                  <p>It is all his owne, and that's a very punctuall Answer.</p>
                  <p>10 This is full of very significant Expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Mr. <hi>Cleeveland</hi> is huge happy, that he hath so much worth the borrrowing by such a Learned Author.</p>
                  <q>12 He adviseth his Son to converse with the wits of the Towne, to refine his Spirit better than Bookes.</q>
                  <p>He speakes of no wits in the Towne, but saith Good Company is a better refiner of the Spirits, than Ordinary Bookes: Good Sir, be a little more honest in citing your Author.</p>
                  <q>13 <hi>Of the Advice to a Son.</hi> Propose not them for patterns, who make all places rattle where they come with Greek, and Latin.</q>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:61739:16"/>
                  <p>Now marke <hi>Heydon</hi>'s Inference, I should be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him a foolish Jugler, that sprinkles his words in any vulgar Tongue against the Lawfull Magistrate, Ecclesiasticall or Civill: A Rare Commentator, you don't blame them who murmur against a Magistrate; ay, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a Lawfull Magistrate, so it be but in an unknown Tongue.</p>
                  <q>14 Arm! Arm!</q>
                  <p>The Advice to a Son speaks Treason against the Majesty of our Rosa-Crucian, and yet you never regard it: He affirmes no Thiefe (The Genius of a Plagiary) is sufferable, who comes not off like a <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> without discovery.</p>
                  <p>16 Here he commends <hi>Iohn Cleeveland.</hi> What plaine <hi>Iohn?</hi> your fellow? but let that passe towards the latter end. He insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates want of Study makes fugitive Divines, like Cowards to run away from their text. He is an expert Disciple of theirs, and loves dearly to run quite away from the Subject he undertakes.</p>
                  <p>The 18 is nothing to the purpose; yet we will allow Sir <hi>Tho. Over.</hi> Paradox to be witty.</p>
                  <q>19 He that reads the Fathers, shall finde them written, as it were with a Crisped Pen.</q>
                  <p>Although this be true, I suppose I may passe without being branded as censori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61739:16"/>
if I Judge the Languages the Fathers are written in, no very intimate acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Mr. <hi>Iohn Heydon</hi>'s.</p>
                  <q>23 This is the Author of <hi>Advice to a Son,</hi> that goes to Sermons onely to shew his Gay Cloathes.</q>
                  <p>It is very unjust that the Accuser should be Judge; but I'le grant you an Admirable Chymist, if you can extract Pride out of this Advice: Weare your Cloathes neat.</p>
                  <q>But it is no Prodigy, if an Author be Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously interpreted, on whom Ignorance and Malice are Scholiasts.</q>
                  <p>Here is almost an other Leafe stoln from Sir <hi>Tho. Overburie</hi>'s Charact. of a Proud Man.</p>
                  <p>26 To the Father advising his Son not to Gallop through a Towne. He replyes thus;</p>
                  <q>Why so? A Party may be riding post upon Life and Death, and then it is but being carefull, and there is no danger.</q>
                  <p>Who can forbeare adoring this Mans In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity? But to his exception, I may ad ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; That if he should chance to croud a Cart up <hi>Holborn Hill,</hi> he shall have leave to make the Horse Gallop as fast as he can.</p>
                  <p>29 Our Author commends Hunting; and I shan't discommend it, provided the Hounds chase not away Moderation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, the Choisest Recreations are culpable. But for my owne part I affect no

                  <p>I do not think the greatest Clerks are nearest Heaven, much of their Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is superfluous. Since <hi>England</hi> was made A Goshen, by the distinguishing light of refined Religion, whilest some of her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Nations were left groping, and stumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the langible darkenesse of Error, and Superstition; Scholers have not (as I may say) Monopolized Heaven: But the unlearned can understand God, speaking in their owne language, by the mouth of His holy Word. Let Agrippa write <hi>de vanitate Scientiarum</hi> to to prove that Every Science, hath its mixture of vanity: Onely Ignorance, the profest Enemy of the Muses, dares take up the Gantlet against this Truth, That Men po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht with Literature, are more adapted to serve God, and their Countrey, and to become Vessels of the Sanctuary, then the knotty Blocks of common Capacities which never were so happy as to meet with the Plainer of Education: But although this is
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:61739:30"/>
confest, yet let those brave Souls, whose Victories over the most crabbed and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartning Sciences, have merited Statues upon the Ambitious Brow of <hi>Parnassus;</hi> take this as A <hi>Memento;</hi> that God is no respect or of Persons: And Pride, that tumbled Angells out, shall exclude from Heaven Man, who is but Dust, and the Son of Man, who is but A Worm. A Scholers greatest Embellishment is Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty usher'd into the World, by an inaffectate affabilitie.</p>
                  <q>No pleasure can make deceit lawfull, &amp;c.</q>
                  <p>When the Scribes, and Pharisees, by vailed and claudestine Wickednesse, had so farre insenced the Lamb of God, that takes away the Sinnes of the World; as that He like A Lyon of the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> denounces <hi>Vae Vobis Scribis, et Pharisaei.</hi> We be unto you Scribes, and Pharisees! the Ever blessed Jesus, oft times immediately subjoyns <hi>Hipocritae,</hi> ye Hipocrites: denot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Hipocrasie, was A principall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in their indictment: it being of so heighnous A Nature, that it forces A curse from the bowells of infinite Mercy. Some of the ancient Heroes, have detested A Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story, borrowed from their Enemies secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61739:31"/>
and the opportunity of A dark night<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> (When Sol taking repose after his diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Careere, and fair Phaebe Neglecting to light her Torch,) woed them to surprize their Enemies Pavilions, And makes them Exchange an opacous Skye, for the gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Tenements of solitary Ghosts. And what A shame is it for Christian Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who fight under the Banner of the crosse, to steale a Victory over their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therens Lives, and Estates, be trayed by an innocent Credulity, not able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the frownes of An Enemy, toucht under the Mask of A formal Hypocrasie: yet this Glo-worme, although it shines to the heedlesse passinger, taken up in the Hand of prudent Circumspection, loses its fraudent splendour; And He that was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> odious in the Eyes of God, becomes now dispicable in the sight of the World. A Man can't cheat another of A penney, but He loses. A Talent of that caelestiall Gold, which will Crown uprightnesse, and Pietie, in the Heaven of Heavens.

No wonder, if under the Churches persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they liv'd together who were to die together, They might well sacrifice their Estate to Charity, who every day expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to have their Lives offered up to malicious Fury: And this community was by Consent, not by Constraint; And so
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61739:32"/>
now, A Man may Lawfully share halfe another Mans Estate, by the owners per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission. We need no other Stratagem to tumble down the <hi>Levellers</hi> Scaling-La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, then this; That the maugurating Sentence, <hi>Come yee Blessed, &amp;c.</hi> As also that dreadful Doome, <hi>Go yee Cursed,</hi> are expresly referr'd by the Omnipotent Lord Cheife Justice of Heaven to works of Charity. As feeding the Hungry, Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Naked, &amp;c.

                  <p>Now if every ones Estate be equall, where will be the Object of Charity, of which there is such A singular Care taken by the Holy Jesus?
