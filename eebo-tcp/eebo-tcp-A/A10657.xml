            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>PSAL. 47. 9.</bibl>
               <q>The Shields of the Earth belong
unto God: He is Greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Psalme is a Psalme
of shouting and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph
at the proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
of a King. At
which solemnitie the
use of the people hath
beene to clap their hands,<note place="margin">1 Reg. 1. 39.</note> to sound the
trumpets,<note place="margin">2 Reg. 11. 12.</note> and with united acclamations
to professe both their joy and their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.
The Gentiles are here called
upon unto this dutie and triumph of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, <hi>vers. 1. 6.</hi> and great reason for
it, in two respects. 1. So great is the
King, who is here proclaimed, as that he
is able to make all his subjects, Kings
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:38630:3"/>
too. He chooseth the excellencie of
<hi>Iacob</hi> for their inheritance, <hi>vers. 4.</hi> And
that was the Primogeniture and right of
Government, <hi>Gen. 49. 3, 4. 10. 2.</hi> So
Great a King he is besides, as that he is
able to subdue all the Princes of the
earth to his obedience, and make them
gather together, or resort unto him,
which is a phrase expressing subjection,
<hi>Gen. 49. 10. Hos. 1. 11.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will say, Is it then so strange
a thing for one Prince to conquer ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
No, the greatnesse of Christs King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is this;<note place="margin">Zach. 4. 6.</note> That Princes doe volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
become his Subjects, not by might
compelling them, but by his Spirit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
them; Not by Armes, but by
Arguments, not by Conquest, but by
Conviction: The princes, the Volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the people are gathered together;
that is, are become obedient to the God
of <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how come Princes to be so flexible
to termes of subjection? How come
they to be willing, nay, ambitious to
stoop to another Scepter? How come the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:38630:3"/>
Grandies of the world to be caught by fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shermen,
and young Lions to be led by
a little childe,<note place="margin">Isai. 11 6.</note> as the Prophet speakes?
The reason of that follows in my Text,
<hi>The Shields of the Earth belong to God,</hi> and
when he will be pleased to exalt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
he can easily subdue and perswade
them.</p>
            <p>Few there are of those whom I have
looked into, who retaining the original
word, <hi>Shields,</hi> doe not understand it in
the same sense with the first word of the
verse, <hi>Princes. Calvin,</hi> I confesse, and
from him some others, though appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
this exposition as consonant to the
scope of the Text, doe yet understand it
in <hi>Abstracto. The Protection of the earth
is of the Lord.</hi> Or, <hi>the Lord is the Shields,</hi>
that is, the manifold Protection of the
earth. And so much doe I honour the
judgement of that most learned Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter,
that as he acknowledgeth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
exposition to be consonant to the
Text, so I shall not altogether neglect
his; but take both the Abstract and
Concrete together, the <hi>Protection,</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38630:4"/>
the <hi>Protectors,</hi> the <hi>Office,</hi> and the <hi>Persons</hi>
protecting the Earth belong all to God.</p>
            <p>But because I finde, 1. The learned
Lexicographers in the Hebrew tongue,
<hi>Pagnin</hi> and <hi>Shindler,</hi> both noting out
this place in speciall, where Princes and
Magistrates are called <hi>Shields.</hi> 2. The
learned Expositors, <hi>Bucer, Melancthon,
Musculus, Illyrious, Tirinus, Muis,</hi> with the
Hebrew Doctors, <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> and <hi>Kimchi</hi>
taking the word here to note <hi>Princes.</hi>
3. Because I finde the harmonie of the
Scriptures, making way, and giving full
allowance to this exposition, <hi>Hos. 4. 8.</hi>
where Rulers are expresly called by the
name of <hi>Shields;</hi> I shall, I hope, with
cleere satisfaction to better judgements
choose chiefly to insist on that sense, as
being in all confessions very pertinent
to the scope of the Text, and most sute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the businesse of the Time.</p>
            <p>Here then we have the <hi>Rulers of the
Earth</hi> set forth by a double relation. <hi>The
one upward,</hi> they are <hi>Scuta Deo,</hi> they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to God: The other <hi>downward,</hi> they
are <hi>Scuta Terrae,</hi> the <hi>Shields of the earth;</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:38630:4"/>
and both these noting two things, their
<hi>Dignitie,</hi> and their <hi>Dutie.</hi> They belong
to God, it is <hi>their honour</hi> that he hath <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi>
them; they belong to God, it is their
<hi>dutie</hi> to be <hi>subject</hi> to him. They are the
<hi>Shields</hi> of the earth, it is their <hi>Honour</hi> that
they are <hi>above others;</hi> they are the <hi>Shields</hi>
of the Earth, it is their <hi>duty to protect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
And surely great reason they
should doe their dutie, when they have
honour and dignity of their owne to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
and to support them in it. But
there is a further reason than that in the
Text, namely the <hi>Honour of God:</hi> for
when the Rulers of the people doe not
only by the sacrednesse of their persons,
but by the holinesse of their lives belong
to God; when they are above the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
not in honor only, to overtop them,
but in love and righteousnesse to protect
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> too, then, never more <hi>vehementer
exaltatur,</hi> the God of Israel is highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted.</p>
            <p>This then is the summe of the words.
A twofold <hi>Dignitie,</hi> a two-fold <hi>Dutie,</hi>
and <hi>Gods honour</hi> the end and ground of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38630:5"/>
all. Of all which by Gods gracious assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
with due respect to the time and
your great businesse. And first of their
relation <hi>Vpward,</hi> They <hi>belong to God,</hi>
their <hi>office to God,</hi> their <hi>persons to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Their</hi> Office, <hi>the Protection of the
Earth belongs to God. The earth is the
Lords, and the fulnesse thereof, and all
the Princes in the world are but his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putles
and Vicegerents, He the Supreme
and the maine Protector. It is not in
man,</hi> he that runneth, nor he that willeth,
but mercy comes from God, Rom. 9. 16. <hi>It
is not in the Church,</hi> he that planteth, or
he that watereth, but the increase comes from
God, 1 Cor. 3. 7. It is not in the battel, the horse
or the rider, but safetie comes from God,
Prov. 21. 31. It is not in the State, the wise
man, nor the rich man, nor the mighty man,
but iudgement and kindnesse come from God,
Ier. 9. 23. <hi>In matters of judicature,</hi> Hee
the Law-giver to rule the cause, Iam. 4. 12.
<hi>He the</hi> Iudge to heare it, Psal. 50. 6. <hi>Hee
the</hi> pleader to argue it, Psal. 35. 1. <hi>Hee the</hi>
witnesse to confirme it, Mal. 3. 5. <hi>Hee the</hi>
King to determine and over-rule it, <hi>and all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38630:5"/>
to the purposes of safetie and Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
The Lord is our Iudge, the Lord is
our Law-giver, the Lord is our King, <hi>hee
will save us,</hi> Isai. 33. 22. O Israel thou hast
destroyed thy selfe, but in me is thy helpe, I
will be thy King, Hos. 13. 10. <hi>It is the divels
stile to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an</hi> Accuser, <hi>it is Christs,
to be <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> an</hi> Advocate <hi>and</hi> Comforter.
<hi>It is the divels worke to be</hi> Abaddon, <hi>a
Destroyer, it is Christs to be</hi> Goel, <hi>a</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.
<hi>When it comes to punishing and
pulling downe, then he calls it</hi> Opus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienum,
<hi>a worke strange unto him,</hi> Ier. 28.
21. <hi>He is not willing to afflict, it comes
not from his heart,</hi> Lam. 3. 33. <hi>But when he
is to build up, to protect, to shew mercy,
to be a</hi> Shield of the earth, <hi>then he delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in that,</hi> Mic. 7. 18.</p>
            <p>You see the Protection of the Earth
belongs to God. 1. <hi>By his Providence,</hi> he
supporteth it, the same vertue being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to conserve the world which was
to create it. 2. <hi>By his Ordinance,</hi> hee
setteth up and establisheth those Orders
of Government which are to administer
it. 3. <hi>By his Assistance and benediction,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:38630:6"/>
he encourageth and prospereth the just
and honourable endeavours of those
that are dispensers of Peace and Iustice.
Lastly, <hi>By the powerfull restraint of his
Law,</hi> over the consciences of evill men,
by the sweet influence of his Grace on
the soules of good men, by planting an
awefull reverence, towards Authoritie,
in the mindes of all men, by his secret
and wonderfull wisdome tempering and
reducing the various events and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies
in the world, to his owne
mercifull ends of peace. By these and
the like powerfull operations, are Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and Common-wealths marvellous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
protected, amidst so many machinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Satan, so many mutinous and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent
affections of men, so many jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies,
and antipathies of States, so
many principles of commotion and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
as a piece of rich and beautiful
Arrasse is curiously wrought out of the
mixture of various and contrary co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.
That every one which looketh
on may say, Verily He must needs be a
God which judgeth the Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:38630:6"/>
O Therefore let us all learne to rest
upon this Protection, not to trust in our
owne counsels, purses, policies, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations,
<hi>The Name of the Lord is the
only strong Tower,</hi> for persons or States
to fly unto. Without this, walls of sea,
and towers of munition, mines of India,
and horses of Aegypt, mountaines of
brasse, and men of Iron would doe no
service, afford no succour or helpe at all.
All the defences of men, without God,
are but a shadow. Their Defence, their

our <hi>Salomon</hi> hath made, and the Lions
about his Throne, since you all belong
to God, above all judge for God. Your

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:38630:13"/>
with his owne power, to be <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum
scutum,</hi> a shield of Protection to
the <hi>Shields of the earth.</hi> Since then you
have so high a Commission, so imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
a Master, so strict a charge, so great
a trust, so strong a fence, so severe a rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning,
so sure a Reward: Above all
things let the Causes of God, to whom
you belong, bee dearest in your eyes.
Those that most neerely concerne the
honour, safetie, and service of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed,
the succour and dignitie of his
Church, the puritie and support of his
worship, the frequenting of his Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
the punishing of his enemies, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
of his Ministers. As God
shall have the glory, and his Church
the benefit, so your consciences shall
have the comfort, your soules the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and your names the honour of
thus Belonging unto God. And so
much of their <hi>first Relation,</hi> their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>Next, they are <hi>Scuta Terrae</hi> too, The
Shields and protectours of the Earth. I
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:38630:14"/>
shall not need tell you that it notes their
Dignitie above others; No Militarie
instrument more honourable than a
shield. When <hi>Salomon</hi> would setforth the
glory and magnificence of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
this the way, two hundred Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets,
and three hundred Shields of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
gold, <hi>1 Kings 10. 16, 17.</hi> Power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is to be able to Hurt, but above
all, Protection and mercy are the works
of Honour. And therefore Princes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
their power of punishing, and
workes of Iustice to their Instruments,
and Ministers, but workes of clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and power of pardoning, as a more
sacred impresse, and more immediate
character of royaltie, they reserve to
themselves. God himselfe, who is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
in all his Attributes, yet singleth
out his Goodnesse and Protection to
shew himselfe glorious by: for Iustice
and Power make Majestie terrible; but
Goodnesse and mercie make it Amiable
too. <hi>I beseech thee</hi> (saith <hi>Moses) shew me
thy Glory:</hi> the answer, <hi>I will make all my
Goodnesse to passe before thee. Who is a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:38630:14"/>
God like unto thee? Who so glorious, that
pardoneth iniquitie, and passeth by trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression,
Mic. 7. 18.</hi> Great Dignitie then
it is to bee Shields of the Earth. It is
so to God, and therefore so to Man
too.</p>
            <p>But it is safer for mortall men to
heare of their Dutie, than of their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
Let us chiefely therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
it in that sense. Not your <hi>Honour</hi>
onely, but your <hi>Office</hi> too it is to bee
the <hi>Shields of the Earth.<note place="margin">Cicero pro Clu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entio.</note> Non tantùm

Orator. Iudges have not onely Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

in them for dispensation of a Dutie, and
that so great a Dutie, as that even of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of Religion doe but stinke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it. <hi>I will not smell in your solemne

and Iudgement, is more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to God than Sacrifice, <hi>Prov. 21. 3.
When you make many prayers, I will not
heare: Goe, seeke Iudgement, relieve the

many Things amongst us which must
not be violated. His Temple, Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,

and Sacraments. How many are there
which rob him of their attendance, how
many <hi>Goliahs,</hi> which defie the armies
and congregations of this our Israel?
<hi>His Name,</hi> a dreadfull and glorious
Name. How many are there which
rob him of their Reverence, How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Rabshakees,</hi> which shoote out blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies

<hi>Psalm. 69. 12. Iob 30. 8, 9.</hi> In these
cases you that are the Shieldes of the
Earth, must rise up to helpe the LORD:
Either as <hi>Phineas,</hi> by lifting up the
sword to punish, or as <hi>Moses,</hi> by lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
up the hand to pray. There is a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:38630:17"/>
double curse, and a bitter one too,
against those which did not. Curse

            <p>Secondly, you are <hi>Scuta inter Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
&amp; Terram,</hi> betweene Injury and
Innocence, to protect the oppressed,
and to punish the offender. Such a
Shield <hi>Iob</hi> was, An eye to the blinde,
a foot to the lame, a father to the
poore, whose cause hee diligently sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
out, when haply the poore man
had more sense to feele the wrong he
suffered, than skill to open it, <hi>Iob. 29.

Shieldes of the Earth. If any of my
friends, Courtiers, or servants have
wronged any man, let him without
feare come unto me my selfe, let him
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:38630:18"/>
make his plaint, and produce his
proofes, I will not onely right him,
but reward him too. It was one of the
miseries which <hi>Salomon</hi> observed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Sunne, that such as were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
had none to comfort them, <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastes
4. 1.</hi> Here then you shall have
much use of your Shield.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>Inter Innocentem &amp; Actorem,</hi>
Betweene Innocence and the Accuser,
who many times out of malice, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequiousnesse,
or a desire to squeeze
money out of simple mens purses, or
some other purse end, doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,
but sycophantize and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niate:
Either forging crimes where
there is no ground at all, as in the case
of <hi>Naboth</hi> and <hi>Mephibosheth, 1 Kings
21. 13. 2 Sam. 16. 3, 4.</hi> Or by cunning
representing Innocent actions under
the shape of crimes, as in the case of
<hi>Davids</hi> messengers to <hi>Hanun, 2 Sam.
10. 3.</hi> It were well these men, or rather
these Wolues, would remember whose
stile it is to be the Accuser of the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<hi>Revel. 12. 10.</hi> That they may
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:38630:18"/>
speedily make use of Saint <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists</hi>
refuge from the wrath to come.
<hi>Doe violence to no man, neither accuse any
falsely, Luke 3. 14.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Inter Innocentem &amp; Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem,</hi>
Betweene innocence and the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
Who haply may sometimes out
of ill will, feare, or some base end, either
forge a Testimonie, as <hi>Gashmu, Nehem.
6. 6, 7.</hi> or at least stretch, and tenter a
truth beyond measure, to doe mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
with it, as <hi>Doeg, Psalm. 52. 3, 4.</hi>
It were well these men would remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
too, that a witnesse should be <hi>Cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peus,</hi>
not <hi>Malleus,</hi> a Shield, not a Maule
or Hammer, <hi>Prov. 25. 18.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Inter Innocentem &amp; Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum.</hi>
Betweene Innocence and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell
sometimes, who haply <hi>Per ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borum
aucupia &amp; tendiculas,</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi>
speakes, by cunning construction ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Lawes or actions, may una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares
protect Injury, and wrong In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence.
I hope they too will take
GODS charge, not to speake in a cause
to wrest Judgement, <hi>Exod. 23. 2.</hi> But ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38630:19"/>
resolve with Saint <hi>Paul, I can doe
nothing against the truth, 2 Cor. 13. 8.</hi>
Remembring that Pleading should bee
to binde and heale, not to wound or
destroy, <hi>Ierem. 30. 13.</hi> It is a noble Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
to bee a Shield of the Earth, but a
very ill office it is to bee <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Scu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
praedatorum,</hi> as the old Glossarie
hath it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Inter Innocentem &amp; Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
facti,</hi> Betweene Innocence and the
jurie: for many times a Tame jurie (as
one speakes) by the craft of one cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
fellow in the company, who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comes possessed with prejudice to
the cause, or ill will to the person, may
swallow any thing, and give in a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
to the oppression of Innocence. It
were well they would learne too, not
to goe like sheepe one after another,
<hi>(quâ itur, non quâ eundum,)</hi> but to bee
led by the sacrednesse of their oath,
and the light of their evidence, not
blindly to suffer their consciences to
bee over-ruled by another mans pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:38630:19"/>
Lastly, <hi>Inter Innocentem &amp; ministros.</hi>
Betweene Innocence and the Officers
and servants of the Court. By whose
Arts it may sometimes happen, as he
said, <hi>Vt tu victrix provincia plores,</hi> That
a mans reliefe shall be as heavie as the
Injurie it removes. I have heard of a
Great <hi>Diana,</hi> called Expedition, by
which there is brought no small gaine
to the Crafts-men. It was a good
speech of an evill Emperour, That by
bad servants <hi>Cautus &amp; optimus vende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur

In a publike famine for the crueltie of
<hi>Saul</hi> against the Gibeonites, first hee
went to GOD, and then hee executed
judgement, and so the famine ceased,
<hi>2 Sam. 21.</hi> Such a Shield was <hi>Ioshua,</hi>

<hi>Moses,</hi> when GODS wrath waxed hot
against Israel for the golden Calfe,
first hee went to GOD to pray for the
people, then <hi>Levi</hi> to the sword to
prune them, and by that meanes the
breach was stopped, and the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
prevented, <hi>Exod. 32. 14.</hi> But when
it came once to this, There is Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,

in the gap, and make up these breaches,
and there was not one, <hi>Ezek. 22: 30.</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:38630:20"/>
When to this Once, Runne to and fro

answer returned but this: The poore
are foolish and cannot, the Great proud
and will not; when thus bones out of

that the flood-gates of GODS judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:38630:21"/>
Your protection must be generall, your
care and benignitie universall, every
member of the Land, must finde shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
under your shade. You must bee
like the Sunne, whose beames shine
with as sweet a benignitie on a garden
of Cucumbers, as on the Forrest of
Libanon. Your justice must extend
it selfe like <hi>Salomons</hi> wisedome, from
the Cedar to the Hyssop. You shall
heare the small as well as the great,
and not bee afraid of the face of man,
<hi>Deut. 1. 17.</hi>

               </gap> is the Apostles
rule in Ecclesiasticall, and it reacheth
to all Iurisdictions: observe these things
without prejudice, or preferring one

should not bee either like nets, to let
out little fishes, and to catch great
ones: nor yet like Cobwebs, to bee
broken by greater offenders, and to

are here called <hi>Scuta Terrae,</hi> so the Law

universall benignitie thereof, and the
equall interest which each person is to

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>You are Shieldes.</hi> Remember: First,
A Shield is a mercifull weapon, none
more: Weapons are distinguished in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Arma ad Tegendum,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Arist. ad Alexand.</note> and <hi>Arma ad no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendum.</hi>
You are of the first sort, and
that not <hi>Galea,</hi> onely for the Head,
nor <hi>Lorica,</hi> onely for the breast. But
a <hi>Shield,</hi> which being a moveable wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon,
carries protection up and downe
to the whole bodie. Your Power is
like that of the Church for Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not for destruction, <hi>2 Cor. 10. 8.</hi>
It is noted by <hi>Tacitus</hi> amongst the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of Agricola,<note place="margin">Vid. Aug. Epist. 158.</note> 
               <hi>Non poenâ semper, sae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pè

if with <hi>Abraham</hi> you can drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the birds from the Sacrifice, though
it bee more troublesome, yet it is more
mercifull than to shoot them. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
some evils must be scattered with
the wheele, but where the eye can doe
it,<note place="margin">Basil. Epist. 79. ad Eustachium.</note> it is farre the better, <hi>Prov. 20. 8. 26.
Basil</hi> the Great noteth it in his times
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:38630:22"/>
as a custome in secular judicature, not
to give sentence on a malefactour,
<hi>Nisi prius obductis velis.</hi> The judges
withdrew themselves under a Curten,
considered weightily the merits of the
fact, heard what could bee alleaged in
favour of the delinquent,<note place="margin">Sic Succenseas iniqui<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

consultation, to let it appeare
that when they punished sinne, yet
they pitied humanitie. When you
must needs passe sentence, yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
you doe it on a man, whose na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is the same with yours, whose
soule as immortall and precious as
yours: and therefore though the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
must die, doe all you can that the
soule may live.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Nerva apud Plin. Ep. lib. 10.</note> Remember a Shield is a
venturous weapon, a kinde of sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
which beares the blowes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
the injuries which were intended
to another,<note place="margin">Iustitia soras spectat, tota se ad alienas utili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates porrigit. Cicere.</note> ventures the cutting and
tearing to doe good, as a candle which
wastes it selfe to illighten others.<note place="margin">Senec. Consolat. ad Polyb. c. 26. Arist. Ethic. lib. 8. cap. 10.</note> Such
a Shield was <hi>David, Not against the
sheepe,<note place="margin">Zenoph. de Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabil. Socrat.</note> rather against mee let thine hand
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:38630:23"/>
bee, 2 Sam. 24. 17.</hi> Such was <hi>Moses,
Blot mee out of thy Booke rather than
not forgive thy people, Exod. 32. 32.</hi> And
such should all the <hi>Annointed ones,</hi>
The Magistrates and the Ministers
bee, like <hi>Ioshua</hi> and <hi>Zerubbabel,</hi> who
emptied themselves of the golden
oyle, and were content to bee dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
for the good of others, <hi>Zach.
4. 12.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Remember a <hi>Shield is a
strong weapon,</hi> to repell the darts of
wickednesse, and to breake them in
pieces. Your Tribunals should bee
<hi>Reorum scopulus,</hi> as hee said of <hi>Cassius,</hi>
or as <hi>Salomon</hi> speakes, You should
scatter the wicked, <hi>Prov. 20. 26.</hi> If a
man bee <hi>Impius ad mortem,</hi> Guiltie of
high crimes, capitall both by munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
and divine Law too; there the rule
is peremptorie, <hi>Non parcat oculus, non
accipias pretium.</hi> No pitie, no price
must ransome there, <hi>Deut. 13. 8. Numb.
35. 21.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, Remember a Shield is an
honourable weapon, none more. Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:38630:23"/>
away of Shields was a signe of
victorie,<note place="margin">Brisson. de form. lib. 4.</note> 
               <hi>2 Sam. 8. 7.</hi> Preserving them
a signe of glory, <hi>Ezek. 27. 10.</hi> They
used to inscribe their Armes and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signes
of Honour upon their Shieldes:<note place="margin">Plin. Hist. Nat. lib. 35. cap. 2, 3.</note>
To raise their Princes,<note place="margin">Petr. Crinitus, lib. 16. cap. 3.</note> and to shew
them to the people upon their Shields.
Doe you so too. The mercie, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
and pietie of our dread Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne,
can no better way shine forth
with sweete influence and gracious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignitie
upon his people, than by your
Iustice. As CHRIST was crucified
before the eyes of the Galatians in
Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> ministery, so, I may say,
A Prince is honoured before the eyes
of all his subjects in a Iudges inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Remember a <hi>Shield must
ever have an eye to Guide it.</hi> You the
Shieldes, and the Law the Eye. GOD
himselfe, when hee judgeth, maketh
speciall use of his Eye, <hi>Being I have
seene, in the case of Israel,</hi> Exod. 3. 7.
<hi>I will goe downe and see, in the case of
Sodome, Gen. 18. 20.</hi> Hee did it not to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:38630:24"/>
informe himselfe, Hee did it to instruct
you. There are many intricacies and
perplexities in businesse, wicked men
are like harmefull beasts, they love <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusa
vestigia.</hi> There are nimble and
cunning Fencers, men that weigh vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<hi>Psalm. 58. 2.</hi> that they may doe
it within compasse, men that plow lyes,
as <hi>Syracides</hi> speakes,<note place="margin">Psal. 50. 19. 94. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Ecclesiasticus. 7. 13.</hi>
that are Artificers at it, and teach it their
tongues, <hi>Ierem. 9. 5.</hi> That lay nets and
contrive injurie with cunning. <hi>Ier. 5. 26.</hi>
That use all the art that may bee,<note place="margin">Job 13. 4.</note> as
<hi>Tully</hi> boasted of himselfe, to cast a mist
before the eyes of the Iudges. In this
case Innocence may quickely suffer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurie,
except the Shields bee guided by
a curious and perspicacious eye. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
States-men and Ministers of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
amongst the Persians, were called
<hi>The eyes of the King,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Brisson. de Reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Persarum, lib. 1. pag. 125, 126.</note> by whom hee did
dispence the affaires of his Kingdome
with wisedome and righteousnesse: In
this point, GOD is very strict in his
charge to the Iudges of Israel, not to
huddle or slubber businesses over with
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:38630:24"/>
an halfe hearing, but to inquire, and
make search, and aske diligently, and
finde out the truth and certaintie of
a thing,<note place="margin">Deut. 13. 14. 17. 2. 19. 17.</note> before they proceed to sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
            <p>It were good to Remember you of
one thing more before wee leave this
point, it will preserve you humble, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right,
and mercifull, and that is this:
As you are <hi>Scuta Terrae,</hi> so you are <hi>Scu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
Terrea</hi> too: <hi>Shieldes of the Earth,</hi> but
yet Shields of Earth. Nothing better
in the warre to dead the Cannon, than
a mound of Earth, but yet it will moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and decay of it selfe. The gods
of the Earth must die like men, <hi>Psal.
82. 6.</hi> The Kings of the Earth must
vanish like foame upon the waters, <hi>Hos.
10. 7.</hi> And when they are gone from
their owne Tribunals, they must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
before a Greater.</p>
            <p>I will now begge but one inch of
your time and patience more, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
you of our third particular,
<hi>Exaltatus est,</hi> never better can the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet
sound, or the people say Amen to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:38630:25"/>
any thing, then to that. <hi>When the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
of the Earth doe belong to God,</hi> doe
submit their Crownes and consciences
to his Kingdome, doe countenance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store,
and advance his Truth and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
when they are <hi>Shields,</hi> to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
justice, and protect the Land,
then never more, <hi>Vehementer Exaltatus
est.</hi> Is the GOD of Israel highly Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
When the Rulers and Princes
that rid on white Asses, and sate in
Iudgement, offered willingly to the
Lord, <hi>Then praise yee the Lord, Blesse yee
the Lord, Awake, awake Debora, rise Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rak,
and lead thy captivitie captive, Iudg.
5. 2. 8.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> and his Nobles
offered willingly to the House of the
Lord, Then, <hi>Vehementer Exaltatus, Thine
O Lord, is Glory, and victory, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie,
and thou art exalted as Head above
all, 1 Chron. 29. 6. 11.</hi> When Kings stand
up, and Princes worship, because of
the Lord. <hi>Then sing O Heaven, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
O Earth, and breake forth into singing
O yee mountaines, Isai. 49. 7. 13.</hi> When
the Kings of Tarshish and the Isles of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer

gifts, and fall downe before him,
<hi>Then let all the world be filled with his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
Amen, and Amen, Psal. 72. 10. 19.</hi> As
on the other side, when it came to this,
<hi>Aedificantes reprobarunt, And doe any of
the Rulers beleeve on him? Iohn 7. 48.</hi>
When it came to <hi>Herods Illusit,</hi> to <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi>
his <hi>Expedit,</hi> to <hi>Pilats Tradidit,</hi> that
they gathered together not unto him,
but against him, <hi>Act. 4. 26.</hi> Then I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
there was an <hi>Exaltatus</hi> still, but like
that of the Brazen Serpent, <hi>Ioh. 3. 14.</hi> On
a <hi>Pole,</hi> not on a <hi>Throne;</hi> and wee know
what a few yeares after produced even
wrath to the uttermost. Consult the
Prophecies of it, <hi>Matt. 24.</hi> Or the storie
of it in <hi>Iosephus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ioseph. de Bello Iudaico. lib. 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 7. Egesip. de Exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio Hierosolym. lib. 5.</note> and <hi>Egesippus,</hi> you
shall finde that there was never sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
like the sorrow of that Nation,
who made their Messiah a man of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
            <p>If I should bee asked the reason of
that long, uninterrupted and most bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Tranquillity which these our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
have, to the envie and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
