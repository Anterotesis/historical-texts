            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Therfore, the verie neceſſarie duetie of a Prince, and<note place="margin">Sapi. vii.</note> aboue all other ordeined by God, is to rule and gouerne his people, which although he be naturally borne (for no euer kyng had any other beginnyng) and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng hath obteined the ſparcles, bothe of equitie and of a princelike courage, yet he muſte bee taught, and made fit for the gouernement, whiche he ſhall take vpon him, whereby he ſhall learne bothe to rule hymſelf, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome thoſe affections, whiche almoſte make a kyng naturally fierce, and knowe hymſelf to bee ſuche a man, in whom, yet no poinct of man muſt appeare, and thinke hymſelf appoincted a Prince ouer other, not onely to be kyng ouer them, but alſo to feade the people, committed to his charge, and to exhorte them to vertue, wherein eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially he muſt hymſelf trauaile, to ſurmount the reſt.</p>
               <p>For as Paterculus writeth, a good Prince teacheth<note place="margin">Lib. ii. hiſto.

For performaunce whereof, he muſt not reſt at any one vertue, but ioyne altogether, that he bee, valt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aunt, chaiſte, ſtoute, liberall, modeſt, gentle, princelike,<note place="margin">Princelike giftes.</note> free, ſober, godly, rightuous, and ſo in all other vertues, whiche be required in a noble gouernours life.

For ſo ſhall he doe his duetie well, ſo ſhall he builde and edifie all thinges, to the glorie of God, ſo ſhall he not onely here in yearth, receiue honour due to a kyng, but in recompence of his watchyng and endeuour, he ſhall receiue an immortalle reward, to be placed emong the nomber of the holy ſain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes.

               <p>Howbeit, no manne is ſo ignoraunt, but he knoweth that the prince is a man, and ſomtyme miſledde, whoſe fall is the occaſion of ſo muche the more harme, the more in ſight his eſtate is emongeſt menne. In whom Dauid warneth vs not to truſt, but as in the ſonnes of men, in whom there is no health. And theſe mightie gouernors be ſore corrupte, when thei begin to ſet little by the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of their life, whiche thei doe then diſpiſe, when as thei ones vnderſtande, that thei be princes aboue lawes, and haue the prerogatiue of honour in their owne hand. For fleſhe and bloud, whereby we bee ſeduced, doe make vs more prone to euill.

               </lg>
               <p>But when the Prince hath been well trained vp, it is hard to kepe hym to doe his duetie, and ſo muche the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the more occaſiions he hath to bee ſeduced, ſo that it ſeameth verie well ſaied, that good princes bee ſo fewe, that thei maie all be wellnigh ſhut in one ring. For the greatnes of their libertie, and knowledge that thei ſhall not be puniſhed, cauſeth theim, either not to heare good counſaill, or to contempne it, and to go forwarde in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng euill. Herevpon commeth it, that ſome princes be ſo rauiſhed with the fonde deſire of huntyng, that thei can not be kept, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer beyng in the woodes, or be ſo giuen
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:2157:28"/>
to riotuous liuyng, that thei neither take any thought, nor any care of their people. Whereas a Magiſtrate ſhould looke to his people, wake when thei ſleape, kepe rekenyng of all mennes behauiours, and to be carefull, leaſt thei deſpiſyng the rule of lawe, growe to a wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.

Beholde I will viſite ouer you, the malice of your deſires, ſaieth the Lorde.</p>
               <p>Then naughtie courtiers, doe corrupt a good prince, and make hym to forſake the waie of rightuouſneſſe, as Vopiſeus writeth in Aurelianus his life: Theſe thinges<note place="margin">Cauſes of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill princes.</note> make euill Princes: firſte of all to muche libertie, then wealth of thinges, thirdly naughtie frendes, a vile gard, courtiers either fooliſhe or deteſtable. For of all this no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, how many thinke you are thei, that either can, or will giue their prince good aduiſe. But one edgeth hym to moue warre, and that vppon no occaſion, for hereby thinketh he to be enriched, though his Prince leſe ſome parte of his landes. I neede not to make mention of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocente bloud, whiche muſt be thereby ſhedde. An other counſaileth hym earneſtly, when he hath miſpente his goodes, to charge his ſubiectes with ſome exactio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, or Tares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> intolerable to theim, but perchaunce not altogether hurtfull to hymſelf. Some, yea, though the Princes bee thereto vnwillyng, thinke it beſt, to breake couenaunt with their creditours, neither to ſtande vnto ſuche licences, as thei haue graunted, and if thei obteine this, thei thinke it a greate vertue. Hereby enſueth it that the people aliene their myndes from their Princes, beginne to miſtruſte, and fall to rebellion, ſo that it ſhall

               <p>Neither muſt we onely impute it to the Princes, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either naughtie men be put in office, or after thei bee ſo made officers, bee corrupte: but rather to our ſynnes,<note place="margin">An euill Prince is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for our ſinnes ſake.</note> whereby we doe leudely ſtraie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the commaundemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of God, and bee vnworthie of a good gouernour, but be conſtraigned to ſuffer the ſcourge, wherewith, when we haue been well canuazed and beaten, it ſelf alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caieth.

For what kinde of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie ſhould that be, wherein one ſhould be compelled to bee hungrie, and he and his children, as it were, to ſtarue for famine (which is a wonderfull piteous caſe) either for want of thinges, wherewith the life ſhould be mainteined, or y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> bicauſe of great dearth, thei ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not bee releiued: and an other hauynge his barnes full, ſhould liue at riot, or alone, as one hauing quicke vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teraunce of wares, ſhould ſticke vpon to moche gaine, oppreſſe the neadie, and ſeke his owne commoditie, to the vndoyng of other, contrary to the verie courſe of nature?

Well then graunt the grounde were quietlie ploughed: yet the fruite would not be deuided with out great trouble and diſſenſion: whiche as it would growe yearely, ſo it would be occaſion of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter debate. Beſides this the neadie ſhoulde beare the bourden, and the riche would take the profite.</p>
               <p>Therefore it were moſte conuenient, this opinion<note place="margin">A proprietie is thinges is moſt allowed.</note> reiected, that euerye man knewe his owne, that ſo the dominion of thinges might bee diſtinguiſhed among men, that euerie man mighte knowe what were his owne, what were not, that goodes might not hange in any vncertaintie. Whereupon Iuſtinian ordeyned manie Lawes for the eſchewinge of iniurie, for the getting of the dominion of thinges, that the common weale fenced therby, might ſtand in quiete, and euery man with regarde to the law, ſhould be content with his owne. And certainlye there be manie reaſons to proue that the pryuate dominion of thinges is verye neceſſary. Firſte bicauſe they be more diligentlie ſeen to: for euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is more affectionate toward his own, then to that whiche is another mans, ſpeciallye when we know that it ſhall deſcend to our heyres and poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, which was the cauſes, why Themperour made a conſtitution that vaſſalles goodes, which eſcheted by death of the tenaunte, ſhoulde be enheritable to the poſteritie, that is, Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Coſens, and heyres males. So greatlie do we delight in thinges that ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newe with vs, and deſire that thei maie be preſerued. Secondlye we be taught by nature to requite ſuch as haue deſerued well of vs, whiche by our goodes maye beſt be doone. For it is not accepted to winne a friend with other mens goodes. For there were no liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in that, accordyng vnto the Prouerbe: A man maie cut large thonges of an other mans leather. There be beſides theſe many reaſonable cauſes to proue that
<pb facs="tcp:2157:127"/>
there ought to be a priuate dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thinges: which euen experience teacheth vs, &amp; there was neuer wiſe man that diſproued the ſame. Yea the hiſtories are ful of enſamples of holye fathers whereof euerie one had his owne in ſeueralle. For Abraham and Loth had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall flockes, in ſo much that when their hearde men coulde not agree (bicauſe they did ſtriue who ſhoulde ſeede theyr cattaill beſt) and the lande could not ſuffice them to dwell together: Lothe remoued to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey about Iordane.</p>

And therefore in the primatyue churche ſuche as were conuerted to the faieth, woulde rather ſell their goodes, and be without theim ſelues, then geue occaſion that others ſhould lacke. Whiche might alſo haue beene moued with this, becauſe the goodes of the faithfull were openly ſolde, and by Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes diſpoyled, which they thought more profitable to conuerte vnto the common and true vſe, that is to the cheriſhement of the poore.

Whiche conuencions becauſe they be priuate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do not

preiudice the common lawe, neither diſpence with the proprietaries. As for example: Xenophon reporteth that Lycurgus in the Lacedemonian common weale, ordeined that the vſe of horſes and houndes ſhould be common.</p>
               <p>But when a proprietie was once permitted, it could not long continue vnabuſed, becauſe mannes nature is eaſilie corrupted, and wil not ſtand ſtill in one ſtaie, but euerie man is ledde after his owne fantaſie, yet ſo muche the more to be borne withall, the leſſe he hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> commoditie.

And therfore we muſt learne our rule to liue by, not out of the Philoſophers writinges, but out of the word of truthe. So in the fifth of Mathew: ye haue<note place="margin">We muſt loue our enemies.</note> heard that it is ſayd, thou ſhalt loue thy neighbour &amp; hate thine enemie: But I ſaye vnto you, loue your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, wiſhe well to them that curſe you, do well to them that hate you, praye for them that hurt and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe you, that you maye be the ſonnes of your father whiche ſuffereth the ſunne to riſe vpon the good and euill, and ſendeth raine vpon the iuſt and vniuſte. For if you loue them that loue you, what reward ſhall you haue? do not the Publicanes ſo? Whiche ſainct Paule<note place="margin">Roma. xii.</note> opening biddeth vs ſeade our enemie, if he be hungry, and geue him drynke, if he be thirſtie: for ſo we ſhall heape coles of fyre vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his heade: theſe be his wordes: if thine enemie bee hungrie, geue him meate, if he bee thirſtie, giue him drinke, for ſo ſhalt thou heape coles of fyre vpon his heade.

<pb facs="tcp:2157:131"/>
But the Fiſher men here it, and they that be poore in ſpirite, merciful, gentle, peace makers, lowlie in hart, ſuch as thirſte for iuſtice: bycauſe theyres is the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen.</p>
               <p>Whiche thinges admit no diſſimulation, but belo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g onelye to perfit men, and we muſte not thinke that a man maie be a true chriſtian, altho he ſuffer his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to die for hunger and thirſte, as they would beate into our heades whiche nether be themſelues parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the heauenlie kyngdome, nether ſuffer other to enter into it: for it is the worde of trueth whereof no iote ſhall paſſe vnfulfilled. Therefore if thou doeſt not feede thine enemie with meate and refreſhe him with drinke, thou ſemeſt to be a manquellour, offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding againſt the lawes, and if thou be founde giltie in one, thou ſhalt be giltie in all.

               <p>This learned leaſure and vacante time is aſcribed vnto them that employ their time to learning, and to the ſtudie of Philoſophie, in maners concerning both GOD and manne, whiche haue neade of ſoche quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of time, that they maie in the meane while apply their ſtudies, and ſo eſtabliſhe their mindes in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placion, that they maie attaine vnto the knowlege of the natures bothe of heauenly and earthlie thinges, ſo farre forthe as mannes knoweledge will reatche.

Therefore Ariſtotle the chiefe Philoſopher (Plato as Tullie thinketh onely except) writeth, that a mannes minde, while he is fitting, is made the wiſer. For they which are wiſe and learned do know with how great endeuour we muſte followe thoſe ſciences whiche are no leſſe comfortable in aduerſitie, then profitable in proſperitie, and euerlaſting witneſſes of the power of God. In conſideracion whereof, we do ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence idle time and occupie our ſelues moſte buſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye therein: accordynge vnto the ſaiyng of Seneca the philoſopher: that idle time not ſpente in learnyng, is<note place="margin">Cato de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publi.</note> verie death and a quicke mans graue.

A certayne euill diſpoſed perſon wente to Apollo at Delphos and aſked him whether that which he had in his hande were aliue or no: now had he a quicke ſparow in his hande, ſo that if anſwere had bene made that it had ben alyue, he woulde haue wronge his hande together and ſo haue killed the pore byrde: but if aunſwere had bene that it had ben deade, he woulde haue caſte it furthe a liue. Therfore Apollo perceyuing the maliciouſnes of the man, aunſwered: it is in thy power whether thou wilt ſhewe it forth aliue or dead. And this fable hath this meanyng: that it is verie harde for vs to deceyue God which ſeeth euen our verie thoughtes. Another: The Lion, the Aſſe, and the Fore, wente on huntinge and gote a praye: which the Aſſe was appoynted to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, and ſo did deuide it into three equall partes: but the Lion, for that he looked for the greateſt porcion ſtomaking the matter, ſtreight wayes deuoured the Aſſe, and bade the foxe make a diuiſion: which heaped all to one for the Lion, and reſerued little for himſelfe. Then the Lion aſked hym howe he learned ſo to do: by the Aſſes miſhappe, <expan>

               <p>Gabrias alſo ment the ſame thinge in thoſe his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles compriſed in eight verſes: The Aſſe cariynge an ymage of ſiluer, the people ranne and worſhipped it: the Aſſe thought the worſhip had bene giuen to him, and therefore caſte of the parkeſadle, and woulde no lenger be an Aſſe but a God: but beyng ofte told that he was not a God, but that which he caried, he left his ſtatelines, and fell agayne to his caryage. Which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble warneth vs to be content with our owne eſtate and not lightlie to become hautie of ſtomake. So, it fortuned on a time that there was a greate conflicte betwene the beaſtes and the birdes, then the Oſtriche (which is partelie a byrde and partelie a beaſt) promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ayde bothe ſides, conditionallye that whether ſo euer of the two had the vpper hande, ſhe mighte be partaker with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of theyr victorie.

               <p>God likewiſe vſeth the elementes oftimes for the reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gment of mans iniquitie.

               <p>There be many ſoche enſamples which daily come in vre, with great terrour, to warne vs that for our ſinnes we be ſore plagued: and that vnles we amend our liues, the axe is laid to the roote of the tree, and the vengeaunce of God hangeth ouer our heades.</p>
               <p>To returne vnto the wicked Magiſtrate, it is moſt certaine that he is ſent vnto vs for our vicious liuing ſake, to anoye and vexe vs, and to make vs remember our Creatour.

               <p>Then ought not we to drawe our weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceablie to labour to depoſe him whiche is ſent vnto vs to viſit ouer our iniquitie, by goddes appointment.

Yet this muſt be added as a finall conſummating of our doinges and trauayle, which apperteyneth vnto the ſcriptures, and Chriſtiane life: That Goddes lawes muſte be ioygned with mannes ordinaunces, the tenne commaundementes muſte be kepte, idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie<note place="margin">Politike ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces muſte not diſagree with the lawes of God.</note> &amp; wicked worſhipping, muſt be rooted out, Gods worde muſt euerie where be preached in churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for godly purpoſes, morall diſcipline muſt be obſerued, ſcholes muſte be diligentlye ſeene to, that youth may be trained vp in good learning and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the tounges, for the vnderſtandyng of goddes worde, for the rulyng and gouerning of the common weale, and ſpecially for the ſettyng furthe of goddes glory. Which is the chiefe cauſe why God would that mans life ſhoulde be ciuill, and commaunded the magiſtrate as a more honorable perſone, to be the ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per &amp; preſeruer thereof, vpon whom as vpon a glaſſe, we are bounde to looke, to learne of him a perfecte trade of life, and to embrace with all our hartes that whiche he ordeineth for the common commoditie.</p>
               <p>And ſurely I cannot finde that their is anie thing more profitable for the eſtabliſhment of ſoche thinges wherby a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon weale is adourned, &amp; daylie holpen, then a parlemente godlily aſſembled.
