         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A free, but modeſt Cenſure on ſome late Debates, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT is an odd Humor in ſome men to cry down all Books that look towards <hi>Polemicks,</hi> and they imagine they ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently diſparage this period of Time we are caſt into by ſaying, it is an <hi>Age of Controverſies.</hi> If they dip into an Author, and find he is upon the Diſpute, they preſently lay him aſide, and will have no more to do with him, becauſe he is a wrangler, and hath faſtned on an Adverſary to debate the caſe with him. It may be obſerved, that theſe who pretend to be ſuch peaceable Souls, are generally of the number of the <hi>indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,</hi> and queſtion whether there be <hi>Truth</hi> on either ſide, or on any ſide: But thoſe who believe there is, and think (as with reaſon they do) that <hi>Truth</hi> is worth the contending for, have an other apprehenſion of thoſe Writings that are Controverſial, and know them to be of great uſe in the World. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we find that ſome of the beſt Writers that were extant in all Ages, have entred theſe Liſts, and have thought it abſolutely neceſſary to appear as Champions in defence of an aſſaulted Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The main Diſputes of late have been about thoſe Points which have reference to the <hi>Trinity,</hi> but I will paſs by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed <hi>Socinians,</hi> whoſe Writings and Diſcourſes have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd and ſifted by ſome of the Learnedeſt men of our Church, as the late Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Worceſter, Gloceſter, Sarum,</hi> the Dean of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> Dr. <hi>Wallis,</hi> Dr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> Dr. <hi>Williams,</hi> Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> and others. All which have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their parts extremely well, but with ſome difference and variety; and there have been infinite deſcants on their ſeveral Attempts, which are now almoſt worn off and forgotten; and I will not call thoſe Diſputes back again, and renew the battel. My deſign is to offer a few Remarks upon ſome other Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies that have been ſtarted of late, wherein one or two of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:59345:3"/>
the forementioned Combatants are ingaged, as well as other freſh ones, who have more lately appear'd on the Stage, and have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited a great number of Spectators to obſerve them.</p>
            <p>The firſt is an ingenious Gentleman, who, tho he hath not profeſſedly liſted himſelf into the <hi>Socinian</hi> Camp, ſeems at leaſt to be a friend and well-willer to that Cauſe, and is again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended and well eſteemed by that party<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſome think is ſet on work by thoſe that favour them. He hath had the fortune to light on two ſhrewd Adverſaries, the one a Reverend and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prelat, the other a worthy and Learned Prieſt of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> both known by their Writings on divers Subjects. The firſt took occaſion in the cloſe of his <hi>Vindication of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity,</hi> to reflect on ſome Paſſages in the <hi>Eſſay of Human <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> as ſome ways prejudicial to the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and other Myſteries of the Chriſtian Faith; and accordingly theſe Paſſages had been made uſe of (as his Lordſhip of <hi>Worceſter</hi> obſerv'd) by another Writer, to confront and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe thoſe Sacred Myſteries; for that zealous oppoſer of <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries</hi> (ſetting up with the other Gentleman upon the ſame Stock, and being Joint-partners in the ſame Principles) contends that we cannot be certain of the Truth of any thing, unleſs we have clear and diſtinct perceptions of it, and therefore where theſe are wanting, there is no <hi>Certainty;</hi> for all certainty of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg depends upon <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and Reaſon depends on <hi>clear Ideas,</hi> which are inconſiſtent with <hi>Myſteries.</hi> It is the managing and applying of this Notion of clear and diſtinct Ideas, ſo as to make them the ſole foundation of Knowledg, Reaſon, and Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, that the foreſaid excellent Prelat hath been pleaſed to examine and diſprove in the 10<hi>th</hi> Chapter of the <hi>Vindication of the Trinity.</hi> And afterwards in his <hi>Anſwers</hi> to Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> this Opinion of Mr <hi>Lock</hi> (for Mr. <hi>T.</hi> took it from him) is narrowly ſerch'd into, accurately diſcuſſed, and fully baffled by his Lordſhip who hath proved that <hi>clearneſs of Ideas</hi> is not the only baſis of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and (the conſequence of that) <hi>Certainty,</hi> but that it is poſſible to be certain of the truth and reality of a thing without clear and diſtinct Ideas of it: and ſome other Principles and Aſſertions of Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> concerning the <hi>Ideas</hi> of things, are ſhewed to be very precarious and groundleſs, and the mere Creatures of his own Fancy. This the Reader will
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:59345:3"/>
find performed with great ſolidity and depth of Mind, together with the mixture of divers fine Thoughts and Conceptions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning other matters bordering on that Subject, with great variety of reading: And this more particularly I have obſerved, and I ſee others agree with me in it, that the Reverend Biſhop hath all along proved that Mr. <hi>Lock contradicts himſelf,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently thwarts his own Notions, which is as ill a thing as can be ſaid of any Writer.</p>
            <p>But that whereby his Lordſhip hath moſt obliged the World is, his accurate anatomizing of this Gentleman; for his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is one that dives into Men as well as Books. Accordingly he hath given us this double Character of him, that he is a great <hi>Sceptick,</hi> and that he hath an inclination to overthrow ſome of the chiefeſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Articles of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith.</hi> This is a high Charge, but that Learned Pen proves it to a tittle, ſhewing out of ſeveral plain and direct Paſſages in Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Book of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> that he takes away all certainty of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, that (as he confeſſes himſelf) he hath <hi>no Idea of a Man,</hi> and that he induſtriouſly labours to make it out, that <hi>there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that we are Men.</hi> Eſſay of Human Underſtanding, <hi>Book</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>Book</hi> 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. His Lordſhip goes on further to ſhew out of his <hi>Letters,</hi> that from his Notion of <hi>Ideas</hi> he can't poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly prove a <hi>God.</hi> And truly if the Idea of a man was bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled at by him, it was to be expected that he would advance further, and ſcruple the Idea of a Deity. Moreover the Biſhop makes it evident that Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> is enclined to hold <hi>no other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in man than Matter;</hi> and then if there be any Idea of a <hi>God,</hi> we know what it muſt be, for he that is for a Corporeal Soul, will (with Mr. <hi>Hobbes)</hi> maintain the Notion of a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Deity. The ſame Learned Pen acquaints us, from his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid <hi>Letters</hi> to him, that he denies the <hi>Identity of the ſame Body</hi> at the Reſurrection with that which died: He makes it appear from the ſame Papers, that he queſtions the <hi>two Natures</hi> in Chriſt, and that he diſbelieves the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and <hi>Incarnation;</hi> and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place (yea in divers) he ſhews that he denies the <hi>certainty of all Faith;</hi> and yet all along talks of the <hi>certainty of Ideas.</hi> Thus this Learned and Judicious Father hath laid that Writer open, and hath let the World ſee, that the more that Author handles his Pen, the farther proofs he gives of the ill diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:59345:4"/>
of his Mind, and the uncouth Notions that harbour there.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable, that the Biſhop ſhews how this Gentleman hath introduced <hi>new Terms</hi> to unſettle the knowledg of things, and amuſe the Minds of the unwary, and how he pleaſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with <hi>paradoxical</hi> Conceits. To which I will add what I have lately obſerved my ſelf out of his <hi>Eſſay of Human <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi> That he hath a great mind to ſcepticize, and to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Paradoxes, we may perceive by what he ſaith of the <hi>Will: Whether man's Will be free or no, is an unreaſonable and unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble queſtion; for Liberty belongs not to the Will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is no attribute or modification of it.</hi> So he, <hi>Book</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. Again, in the ſame place he tells us, that <hi>in reſpect of Willing a man is not free, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty conſiſting in a Power to act, or not to act, which, in regard of Volition, a man hath not.</hi> Some that have read this, think he may go with that <hi>Petition</hi> he talks of in another place, <hi>Pray give me a little Senſe.</hi> Afterwards in the ſame Book and Chapter he concludes thus, <hi>This then is evident, a man is not at liberty to Will or not to Will any thing in his Power that he once conſiders of.</hi> Now from theſe and ſeveral other things that occur in his Writings, we may gather, that my Lord Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi> had reaſon to ſet him forth to the world as a <hi>Sceptick,</hi> and to charge him with <hi>laying ſuch foundations as tend to the overthrow of the Myſteries of our Faith. Anſw.</hi> to Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s 2<hi>d</hi> Letter. This is the true Portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that Author, which is abundantly made good in his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips excellent Obſervations on the <hi>Eſſay of Human <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> and on the <hi>Letters</hi> of the ſame Writer; whence he hath been pleaſed to communicate to the World the true apprehenſions we ought to have of him. This is the beſt and ſhorteſt way of dealing with him, and it is a proof of his Epiſcopal Integrity and Sincerity.</p>
            <p>But what ſaith the <hi>Eſſayer,</hi> and the writer of <hi>Letters</hi> to this? Why, he charges the Biſhop with <hi>unaccurate Thoughts,</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable ways of ſpeaking,</hi> and <hi>vulgar and popular Diſcourſe.</hi> Letter 1. p. 153. And in other Places he will not allow him to underſtand <hi>the Connection of words,</hi> or <hi>true Engliſh,</hi> p. 155, 156. and the Contents of moſt of his <hi>Vindication</hi> and <hi>Anſwers</hi> he pronounces <hi>unintelligible, incomprehenſible, difficult, impoſſible, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding.</hi> And yet all along he lards his pages with ſeeming Compliments and Commendations of his Lordſhip, with feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Submiſſions, and doing of Homage. This double ſtrain is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:59345:4"/>
uſual with him, which makes him inconſiſtent with himſelf: and in his laſt <hi>Edition</hi> of his <hi>Eſſay</hi> he retracts ſome things which he had inſerted into the former, <hi>Book</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. He makes bold, he ſaith in his 23<hi>d</hi> Chapter, <hi>to propoſe an extravagant Conjecture,</hi> and ſoon after he begs the Readers Pardon for his <hi>wild fancy,</hi> and ſo much for that, he ſaith. In another place <hi>(Book</hi> 4. <hi>Ch.</hi> 4.) to the Queſtion, <hi>What are Changlings?</hi> His ſtudied anſwer is, <hi>They are Changlings. Query,</hi> Whether this be not the ſame with <hi>Condign Puniſhment is Condign Puniſhment.</hi> The like profound way of writing the Biſhop takes notice of in his <hi>Letters,</hi> telling us, that inſtead of a ſober and ſteady <hi>Reply</hi> to his Allegations, <hi>he ſpends above fifty Pages in renewing and enlarging a Complaint wholly concerning himſelf.</hi> Anſwer to Mr. <hi>L</hi>'s 2<hi>d</hi> Letter. And the reſt is ſpent (as he objects to him) in miſrepreſentations of things, in groundleſs exceptions, in weariſom repetitions out of his own Writings, and ſometimes in looſe and poor <hi>Jargon;</hi> a goodly Inſtance whereof we have in his <hi>Dialogue</hi> (from <hi>p.</hi> 117, to <hi>p.</hi> 161. Letter 2.) <hi>between him and a certain Gentleman,</hi> tho in reality it is a Conference between Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> and himſelf, unleſs you will add <hi>Couſheda,</hi> or ſome other of his <hi>Drills</hi> to bear him Company. This it is <hi>to write out of a mans own Thoughts</hi> (as we know who ſaith of himſelf) this it is to be ambitious to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the pages of a Book, and to ſtudy to make it bulky: this it is to be a grave and ſolemn Trifler. Hence he lets the Biſhop know, that he will go on with the Controverſy ſtill, and not let it fall, becauſe he is not ſatisfied with what his Lordſhip hath ſaid (and ſome are of opinion that he is reſolv'd never to be) and that he will fill the World with Replications, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joinders, Surrejoinders.</p>
            <p>But let that be as he pleaſes, it is ſufficient that we have ſhew'd the invalidity of what he hath writ already. I confeſs I was inclined to Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s ſide, before I read and well peruſed the Biſhops remarks upon him. He hath gained a Name by diſſenting from others in the Subjects he diſcourſed of, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I looked upon him as a man of free Thoughts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd he meant no ill in that liberty which he took, but acted only as a man of good Parts, and ingenious freedom would do. But his Lordſhip's judicious Animadverſions on his <hi>Letters,</hi> and other Writings, have given me another Idea of him. And I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:59345:5"/>
can entirely depend upon his Lordſhip's judgment, becauſe I ſee it is founded on moſt natural and rational Collections, made from what Mr. <hi>Lock</hi> hath expreſly aſſerted, and often repeated. So that I am a Proſelyte by his Lordſhip's Writings, and I am the more ſo, becauſe I ſee his Antagoniſt hath not been able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn any tolerable Anſwer to what hath been ſaid. Some had thought that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> had been too ſevere with this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and repreſented him in falſe colours; but now the diſcovery which the Biſhop hath made juſtifies Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s Proceedings: and all men of conſideration and due thoughts conclude, that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> had juſt occaſion (tho we knew it not ſo well as he did) to alarm the World with the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the danger of Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Writings.</p>
            <p>We come then in the next place to conſider <hi>theſe two</hi> noted Writers, and to make ſome Remarks on their reſpective Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings. And firſt I will begin with Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> for tho I did not give him the priority in the Title-page, he ſhall have it now. Thinking is the great excellency and prerogative of our Human Nature; and there are none that ever arrived to true and ſolid Apprehenſions of things, without the exerciſing this noble Faculty, and that with great ſeriouſneſs and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. But it is poſſible that a Perſon may be very Thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and yet not attain to any conſiderable Notions of what is true, becauſe his Thoughts are tinctured with ill Principles and Deſigns, and conducted and managed all along by Caprice, and Prejudice, and Opiniatrity. We have an example of this in the Author who is now under our hands; it can't be denied that he hath ſhew'd himſelf a Thinking man in his <hi>Eſſay of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> (of which I ſpoke before) and in his later writings concerning the <hi>Reaſonableneſs of Chriſtianity</hi> (as he calls it) and his <hi>Vindication</hi> of them, of which I am now to ſpeak. Theſe latter ſufficiently diſcover him to be one of a muſing Head, and a thoughtful Brain; but at the ſame time they teſtify him to be either a great Stranger to the Chriſtian Religion, or elſe a great Corrupter of it; and truly it is this latter which he chuſes to be known and ſignalized by, as appears from his ſtiff Defence of this Aſſertion, that of all the Articles and Points of the Chriſtian Religion, there is but <hi>one</hi> that is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:59345:5"/>
to be believ'd, to conſtitute us true Chriſtians, and that is this, <hi>Jeſus is the Meſſias.</hi> And as for the Apoſtolical <hi>Epiſtles, it is not there,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>that we are to learn what are the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Articles of Faith.</hi> One would ſcarcely think, that a man never ſo thoughtful and muſing, could light on ſuch a Notion as this; much leſs would it enter into a mans Thoughts, that he ſhould with ſo much zeal and earneſtneſs perſiſt in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. To evade the Doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and our Saviour's <hi>Satisfaction</hi> (both which I find he hath been urged by Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> to own, but he begs his Pardon, he will not ſubmit to any ſuch acknowledgment) and to render the other great Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of Chriſtianity ſupernumerary, and uſeleſs to give men the denomination of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and ſo to caſhier <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity</hi> it ſelf, he hath unhappily placed in the room of all theſe, the belief of that one ſingle Article before mention'd. And herein he runs counter to the poſitive determinations of the Holy and Inſpired Writings, and the ſuffrages of all the wiſe, intelligent, and godly Chriſtians in all Ages ſince the foundation of that Holy Inſtitution, as well as the perſwaſion of all that have a true ſenſe of the nature of Chriſtianity at this day: This is a thing which his <hi>Fellow-Collegian</hi> will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him for, who delivers it among his other Maxims, that <hi>a man of a ſound and well-weigh'd judgment is afraid always of ſtanding by himſelf in a new Opinion.</hi> Mr. <hi>Charles Boyle</hi> againſt Dr. <hi>Bently,</hi> p. 226. And he tells him further, <hi>p.</hi> 237. that <hi>Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Paradoxes are not the true way to a laſting Reputation. The firſt point of Modeſty and Senſe, is never to contradict the whole World needleſly; and the next to that, to be ſure never to do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out very good Grounds.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> cannot avoid the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a <hi>Pedant,</hi> according to this noble Gentleman; for it is another of his learned Maxims<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That <hi>an itch of contradicting great Men, or eſtabliſh'd Opinions upon very ſlight grounds, is an inſtance of Pedantry,</hi> p. 97. And in the ſame place this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Writer makes it another mark of a <hi>Pedant,</hi> that he relies on his own performances, and <hi>ſpins Volumes</hi> (as one ſaith he hath the gift of it) <hi>barely out of his own Thoughts.</hi> Tho this muſt be granted that he can make bold with another ſpin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Thoughts, and impoſe upon the World with borrowed Cobwebs, for Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> and others have ſhew'd, that the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59345:6"/>
               <hi>one Article</hi> was borrow'd from Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>'s <hi>Citizen</hi> and <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>athan.</hi> Nor indeed is this the only thing wherein he jumps with Mr. <hi>Hobbs,</hi> as in the <hi>Materiality of Human Souls.</hi> Letter to the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> p. 68.</p>
            <p>Theſe things have purchas'd him a great diſeſteem among all men of ſtaid Minds, all that retain a regard to ſober Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy and Orthodox Divinity: as on the contrary Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi>'s obſervation is true, that Perſons of looſe Principles, Scepticks, and Deiſts, applaud his undertakings, and are his humble admirers. I find that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> in his <hi>Thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Cauſes and Occaſions of Atheiſm,</hi> was the firſt that attack'd him, briefly laying open the weakneſs, folly, and abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, as alſo the extreme danger of aſſerting the neceſſity but of <hi>one Article of Faith,</hi> in order to the making a man a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> He treated Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> very kindly and civilly, beſtowing upon him the Epithets of <hi>Learned, Ingenious, Thoughtful, Ripe-witted,</hi> &amp;c. But this fair uſage, join'd with ſtrength of Argument, had no other effect on him than this, that it produced a ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Vindication</hi> of himſelf; wherein this was the only thing made out to the Reader, that he was reſolv'd to adhere to his own Sentiments: Whereupon Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> thought fit in a larger Diſcourſe <hi>[Socinianiſm <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmask'd]</hi> to handle the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Subject, where he condeſcended to Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s <hi>Demands,</hi> and proved, that there are <hi>ſeveral other Articles</hi> to be expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely believ'd, in order to the making us Members of Chriſt, beſides that one, <hi>Jeſus is the Meſſias.</hi> This he hath evinced, by inſtancing in divers particular Doctrines, and ſhewing, that we cannot poſſibly be <hi>Chriſtians</hi> without the belief of them: and (as I am told) he had the Thanks of ſome the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent men in our Church, for his great pains and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in aſſerting and vindicating the moſt ſubſtantial Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of our Holy Religion, when they were ſtruck at ſo boldly by men of corrupt Deſigns.</p>
            <p>When Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> found himſelf thus foiled, inſtead of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to his own Confeſſion, <hi>I know not any thing,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>more diſingenuous, than not publickly to own a Conviction one hath received concerning any thing erroneous in what one hath printed,</hi> (Letter to the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter)</hi> he writ a Preface and Book (if Ink and Paper make a <hi>Book)</hi> of above 500 pages,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59345:6"/>
to tell the World that he was angry with Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> and highly diſpleas'd with his plain and impartial dealing with him, and not treating him according to his fond expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Every one obſerv'd that he ſtarted little needleſs pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantick <hi>Queſtions,</hi> and fooliſhly demanded an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to them, with a mixture of childiſh Complaints, and wilful miſtakes; and according to the enquiry I have made into thoſe Papers, I find he was ſo hardy as not only to fall upon Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s Perſon, but his Office, and he rudely vilified the whole Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It is true, it is the opinion of ſome upon this occaſion, that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> might have been even with him by bare Contempt, for this is the juſteſt return to ſuch an Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but I find Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> was pleas'd to take another courſe, becauſe, I ſuppoſe, he had a mind to diſcover this Writer yet further to the World, and likewiſe to take off his little <hi>Objections</hi> which he had fill'd ſo great a Volume with, and eſpecially to vindicate the honour of thoſe Learned Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> had aſperſed and vilified. I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed ſeveral upon this Subject, but I never met with any that blamed Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s way of dealing with this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, unleſs ſuch as were ſworn favourers of him, or were troubled with qualms of Scepticiſm and indifferency in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or did not underſtand the liberty a man may lawfully take in chaſtizing an Antagoniſt, or laſtly excepting two or three Hawkers who have felt the miſchief of ſome bodies Books lying on their Hands, ſince the Biſhop and Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd them: All others unanimouſly concur in this, that Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> hath been dealt with according to his Genius and Merits. A good ſenſible Gentleman was one day expreſſing his diſlike of ſome things in Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s laſt Effort on Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> which reflected, he ſaid, on his Studies, his way of Living, and the Poſt he is in. Whereupon I turn'd him to ſome Paſſages in Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Book, which expreſly reflected on Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, his Station in the Church, his Office as a Clergy-man and a Preacher, and on the Univerſities and Clergy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; which when this Gentleman had read and conſider'd, he made me this Return, I ſee there is reaſon to hear both ſides, whereas hitherto I have attended but to one, Mr. <hi>L</hi>'s Friends being ſo clamorous and urgent. I verily think, if
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:59345:7"/>
there be any Offence, it is on his ſide; for a man may inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently reflect on the private concerns of an Adverſary, when there is juſt occaſion given; but it is unſufferable to jeſt and play with Sacred Things, and to flout at thoſe Employments and Offices which have the ſtamp of Religion upon them: which puts me in mind, ſaid this Gentleman, of what I was told a very ſober Writer, in one of his <hi>Occaſional Papers,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to Mr. <hi>Locke, viz.</hi> his diſreſpectful language to <hi>Prieſts,</hi> that is, all Miniſters and Clergy-men.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, I could have wiſh'd, continued that Gentleman, that when Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> was excepting (and that juſtly) againſt ſome things in Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Treatiſe of <hi>Education,</hi> he would have taken notice of what is uſeful and commendable in it, <hi>viz.</hi> his common places of Temperance, of Company, of Familiarity, of Affectation, of Rewards and Puniſhments, of Self-denial, Fool-hardineſs, Fortitude and Courage, with Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, Hints, Cautions, Counſels concerning the humours of Children, and the manners of Men. Theſe Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> might have taken notice of, I ſay, and own'd their uſefulneſs in ſome meaſure; and thereby have ſhew'd, that he deſpiſed not what was any ways good and commendable in his Adverſary: But ſo might Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> it may be ſaid, have acknowledg'd the convictive arguings in Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s Writings, and the other accompliſhments of his Pen, which have made his Books accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able among Foreigners, as well as thoſe at home. But one thing I muſt needs ſay I wonder Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> did not reflect upon, when he was handling that Book of <hi>Education, viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Lock's</hi> forgetfulneſs of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> It being his work and deſign in thoſe Papers to inform and inſtruct <hi>Youth,</hi> if he had been pleas'd to remind them that there is ſuch a thing as <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> in the World, he might have done ſervice to the Age, eſpecially when he knows there is a Generation of People who have no regard to the revealed Truths of Religion, but on the contrary, diſown them. What! nothing but Ethick and Oeconomick Strictures, and ſuch like Documents? Is not his <hi>young Maſter</hi> (for ſo he calls him) <hi>baptized?</hi> Doth he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs himſelf to him as to a <hi>Pagan, Turk,</hi> or <hi>Jew?</hi> He ſhould for <hi>once</hi> at leaſt have made mention of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and the bleſſed Inſtitutor of it, and taken occaſion to commend
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:59345:7"/>
that excellent Diſpenſation: One little ſprinkle at leaſt would have done well, eſpecially in an Age where <hi>Deiſm</hi> is ſo rampant. But truly, added this Gentleman, it is well he did not touch upon <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> as the matter ſtands, for he might have done more harm than good, as we learn from his Book, which he ſtiles the <hi>Reaſonableneſs of Chriſtianity.</hi> Thus he.</p>
            <p>But to return to Mr. <hi>Edwards,</hi> and his ſharp way of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> tho to charge Perſons with what they are not guilty of, be <hi>Reviling</hi> and <hi>Reproaching</hi> them; yet to deal free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with them, and to tell them their own (eſpecially when others decline it) is an act of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Honeſty.</hi> A frank ſpeaking or writing here is very Innocent, and ſometimes Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, tho in other caſes ſome uſe it unlawfully; but this uſing it ſo doth not make the thing it ſelf unlawful. Honeſt men may wear and uſe <hi>Swords,</hi> tho Highway-men do ſo too; and the former may uſe them againſt theſe latter when there is occaſion: Sharpneſs of ſtile, and a ſeaſonable Raillery are not forbidden us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and generally there are none that utterly condemn theſe, but thoſe that are afraid of them, and deſerve them. When we cannot <hi>reaſon</hi> ſome men out of their evil Opinions and Practiſes, we may try to <hi>laugh</hi> them out of them. When I peruſed Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s laſt Reflections on Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> I call'd to mind that of the excellent <hi>Juſtin,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, i. e. <hi>It is not at all incongruous to make our ſelves merry with the ſurly humour of thoſe men who pretend to ſurpaſs others in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi> (Juſt. Martyr. ad Zen. Epiſt.) This was the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a ſerious <hi>Philoſopher</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and one that laid down his Life for Chriſtianity. We may as lawfully <hi>deride</hi> a ſtubborn Adverſary, as <hi>argue</hi> with him: And this we ſhall find to be the practiſe of the moſt wiſe and grave upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, as is to be ſeen in ſeveral of the Writings of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,</hi> who were otherwiſe very auſtere. It is well known, that moſt of the Learned and Religious <hi>Apologiſts</hi> for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> were very pleaſant and diverting in their Writings, and uſed a Sarcaſtick Stile, and ſpared not their Adverſaries. The like we ſee in the Examples of ſome of the Learnedeſt and moſt Judicious of our own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Mountague,</hi> and others that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:59345:8"/>
writ againſt Mr. <hi>Selden;</hi> Dr. <hi>More,</hi> the Author of the <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Debates,</hi> Dr. <hi>Grove,</hi> Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> in his <hi>Conferences between a Romiſh Prieſt,</hi> &amp;c. ſome of the <hi>London-Divines</hi> in their printed Reflections on <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and other <hi>Papiſts</hi> in the late Reign, Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> upon Mr. <hi>Warren,</hi> Dr. <hi>South</hi> on the Dean of St. <hi>Pauls,</hi> and the <hi>Dean</hi> and others upon him; Dr. <hi>Williams</hi> and other late Writers againſt the <hi>Engliſh <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians.</hi> Theſe all thought Reflecting was no Sin; and ſome others perhaps are flat, grave and reſerv'd, becauſe they can't be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
            <p>It is not unknown to the World, that the Perſon I am now ſpeaking of, can write as ſolidly as any man, and the beſt proof of it is, that he hath done ſo: but if he pleaſes to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſuch great Examples as I have named, and to relax his Pen, who can cenſure him for it? Nay, who will not juſtify him? For who are more fit to be treated with Contempt, than thoſe that treat <hi>Religion</hi> and the moſt <hi>ſubſtantial Articles</hi> of it in that manner? I don't ſee then how it can give of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to men of impartial Thoughts, to give a Writer ſuch treatment as he merited. Wherefore we expect with ſome impatience Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s <hi>farther Remarks</hi> on Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s 2<hi>d Vindication,</hi> and that <hi>ſet of Animadverſions</hi> on ſome other parts of his <hi>Education,</hi> which he partly promis'd in his laſt Book, <hi>pag.</hi> 91. There is a ſort of men, I perceive, would have had Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> touch'd Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> with more tenderneſs; and ſo they would have all Writers be very ſweet upon their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents, and ſhew themſelves as mild and gentle as cade Lambs: tho they wield their Pens againſt the ſtiffeſt Patrons of Error, they muſt compliment and flatter them, they muſt ſhew themſelves very fond of them, and addreſs themſelves to them with great reſpects and honour, or at leaſt they muſt not dare to provoke and exaſperate them, tho it be by the innocent freedom of urging <hi>Truth.</hi> This faint ſort of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning may be obſerv'd eſpecially in one known Writer of late, and if there were more ſuch, the Miſchief of that ſneaking Humour would be unſpeakable. But I perceive Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s fault is, that he is none of thoſe hum-drumming Authors; and thence it is that he is diſguſted by thoſe of that kidney, and hath the honour to bear the ſame imputation that was
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:59345:8"/>
cauſeleſly thrown upon my Lord Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> in one of the late <hi>Socinian</hi> Pamphlets, that he was a paſſionate and angry Writer, and not fit to write Controverſies.</p>
            <p>But the truth of the matter, with reſpect to the Gentleman Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> hath to do with, is this, that he began to be very daring, and with diſdain to trample upon <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities, publick Schools, Clergymen,</hi> &amp;c. as well as upon the moſt ſacred and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable <hi>Articles of our Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and the very <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of the inſpired Apoſtles; which occaſion'd Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> to appear againſt him with ſome ſeverity and indignation, and to be plain and home with him, and to be a little upon the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> with him. He thought good to treat him roundly and ſmartly, and to interſperſe here and there ſome nipping Sarcaſms. And now we ſee and are convinced, that this was the <hi>beſt</hi> way of dealing with him; for this ſort of Medicaments hath cured his Pen of the <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> at leaſt as to this preſent Cauſe for a time. As we owe it likewiſe to this plainneſs and freedom that the late <hi>Socinian</hi> Writers were took down ſo ſoon. By the pointed dint of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s Arguments in his <hi>Socinian Creed,</hi> and by the free and ſmart Laſhes he diſtributed among thoſe Gentlemen, this great Service was done to the Church. And I am perſwaded, and ſo are others, that he will never hear from them again, eſpecially now their great <hi>Pan</hi> is dead, who uſed to hand their Papers to the Preſs, and to pay for them. It is the general opinion, that if Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> had not run the Gantlet, we ſhould not have been quiet for him; whence we ſee there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of uſing this ſevere Diſcipline towards him. It was as requiſite as ſober and cloſe <hi>arguing,</hi> of which he had abundance in Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s ſeveral Writings. Here was no unfair deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> did nothing that was ungenteel, or argued him to be a ſtranger to good Manners, no more than the Gentlemen of the Grand Jury of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> who thought fit to give Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s Book a place in their <hi>Preſentments.</hi> To conclude, it is a vulgar Saying (tho borrowed from an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Pen) that Writers of Controverſies ſhould <hi>uſe ſoft Words and hard Arguments:</hi> But tho the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi> hath fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd this exactly in his Controverſies with Mr. <hi>Locke,</hi> yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> nor Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> have tied themſelves to this Rule, for Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> in his Debates with the Biſhop hath <hi>ſoft</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:59345:9"/>
               <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>ſoft Arguments;</hi> and in his laſt Debates with Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> he hath ſome very <hi>hard words,</hi> tho his <hi>Arguments</hi> be very <hi>ſoft.</hi> But of Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> it is generally ſaid, his <hi>Arguments</hi> are <hi>hard</hi> as well as his <hi>Words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Leaving Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> and his Antagoniſts, we proceed to Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of another nature and kind. And the next pair is of the <hi>Critical</hi> Claſſis: the Honourable <hi>Charles Boyle</hi> Eſq; having pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> of <hi>Phalaris,</hi> &amp;c. Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> not long after put out his <hi>Diſſertations</hi> upon them, wherein he makes ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on the Editors, but chiefly on the performance it ſelf. I don't think he had any ill deſign, but he ſhews himſelf a true thorough-paced <hi>Critick,</hi> that is, one that flies at all, cenſures and condemns all as he ſees occaſion, and ſpares neither perſons nor things, for elſe he would not be a right <hi>Critick.</hi> It is a hard matter to decide the Controverſy between Perſons of this <hi>Study,</hi> for there is a great deal of ſubtilty and double-dealing in the ordinary managing of the <hi>Criticks</hi> Office; and it is an eaſy matter for a well-read man to thruſt his Notions on the belief of the world, and to gain a very good reception, tho they have little ſolidity at the bottom. I will not undertake to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe here, for he only is to be Umpire that fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands both ſides. But I hope I may be permitted to report what every unbiaſs'd man ſaith that hath inſight into that ſort of Learning, namely, that the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s Criticiſm is very brave and noble; and if it be not exactly adjuſted to Truth, yet it is very probable.</p>
            <p>Then comes Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> and ſhews himſelf a great <hi>Critick,</hi> and a witty one: He hath amaſs'd a great deal of Reading to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, excellently criticized for his own turn; but when all is done, his Quotations do not reach the Buſineſs. However, this muſt be ſaid, he hath taken a great deal of pains, or ſome body for him hath ſo, for this is that which the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Doctor hath more than hinted, that Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> was not the Author of that Work; yea, that there was a Club of <hi>Criticks</hi> to finiſh it; that it was patch'd up of ſeveral pieces, and by ſeveral hands. Cuckow-like they had tranſlated their own brood, and laid it in this Gentleman's Neſt. But to be free with the Learned Doctor, tho moſt men think this to be true, yet unleſs he had had
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59345:9"/>
good ground for it, he ſhould have been ſilent, eſpecially when he dealt with a Perſon of Honour, and one that had been late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reading not only <hi>Roſſcommon,</hi> but an antienter Poet,
<q>
                  <l>—Quae non fecimus ipſi,</l>
                  <l>Vix ea noſtra voco—.</l>
               </q>
Therefore truly I think the Learned Doctor ſhould have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely owned him to be the <hi>Author</hi> of that undertaking, till he could evince the contrary, and the rather becauſe that Gentleman publickly ſet his <hi>Name</hi> to it, and told the World it was his. But let us ſee how this incens'd young Critick handles the Doctor, and truly he doth this roughly enough; for firſt he reflects on his <hi>Morals,</hi> and accuſes him of falſe dealing, lying, cheating, denying his own words—<hi>p.</hi> 5, 6, 7, 8. and he produces other mens words and hands againſt him. The deciſion of all which wholly depends on the integrity of the Witneſſes, and on the fair and ſincere interpreting of what paſſed on both ſides; and therefore I ſhall wave this, and proceed to that which we may more eaſily judg of. Only all that I will ſay at preſent is this, that from what an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Gentleman beyond-ſea, <hi>Monſieur Grevius,</hi> is ready to atteſt to the World, we ſhall be able to gueſs what weight there is in the reſt of the Stories and Relations. Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> (to let us know, at his firſt ſetting up to write, that he intends not to be ſparing in his Reflections) grates on the Doctor's <hi>breeding, Pref.</hi> tells him of his <hi>dependance on—p.</hi> 12. upbraids him with want of <hi>Humanity,</hi> ibid. Objects to him <hi>ill breeding,</hi> p. 22. <hi>ill-manners,</hi> ibid. He lets the Doctor know that he acts <hi>not like a Scholar or a Chriſtian,</hi> p. 24. or <hi>one in Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> ibid. He charges him with want of <hi>Modeſty,</hi> p. 28. with <hi>affectation of Pedantry,</hi> p. 34. defect of <hi>ſagacity and ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> p. 67. he ſaith he is <hi>a man of no meaning and deſign,</hi> p. 68. <hi>one that hath no reliſh or taſte of the proprieties of any of thoſe Languages he hath pretended to judg of or write in,</hi> p. 72. he jeers at his Employment of <hi>Library-keeper,</hi> p. 91, 100. he lays to his charge <hi>diſabliging rude qualities,</hi> p. 111. <hi>miſrepreſenting of Authors to ſerve a turn,</hi> 117. laughs at him for <hi>quibble and witticiſm,</hi> 133, 134, tells him <hi>he is faſt aſleep,</hi> and yet <hi>talks</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:59345:10"/>
               <hi>wildly,</hi> 137. he means he talks in his Sleep. He commonly ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigns him as a <hi>Filcher</hi> and a <hi>Plagiary,</hi> he calls him <hi>a weeder of Writers,</hi> 216. and (to let us ſee he improves in his Stile) he honours him with the Epithets of <hi>Aſs</hi> and <hi>Dunce,</hi> 220. And in one ſingle page he lays it on thick, telling him he is <hi>falſe and diſingenuous in his dealings, fierce and vindictive—lofty and inſulting—ſcurrilous, clowniſh,</hi> p. 222. and every where he repreſents him as a Fool, a weak Creature, as a man neither of Underſtanding nor Integrity.</p>
            <p>Here is the charge, which is either true or falſe; if the former, then Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> is the only diſcerning man in the World (which no body I think believes, no not himſelf) for no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy but he will or can ſay all theſe things of the Doctor. If the latter, then ſome body begins the Prize betimes for the Whetſtone, and few can boaſt they have the better of him: But I will not be ſo rude as to impeach him of falſity, tho the thing he ſaith be not true; for perhaps it may ſeem true to him, and then if he delivered only his Opinion, he doth not falſify. As to Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi>'s ſtile, it is very reflecting and ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtick; and if any man thinks otherwiſe, he deſerves to taſte of it. But ſuch as it is, if Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> had deſerv'd it at his hands, it had not been culpable: For it is not the ſeverity of Language that renders it blameable, but the ill deſign and end that make it ſo. An ingenious Gentleman was pleas'd to ſay, <hi>There is not ſo much Truth ſpoken any where as at</hi> Billinſgate, <hi>(Blount</hi>'s Life of <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus,</hi> written by <hi>Philoſtrat.)</hi> becauſe others are mealy-mouthed, and loth to ſpeak out, but they tell one anothers faults plainly and roundly, tho with unſufferable indecency of words, and with implacable Paſſion, and to very unchriſtian ends and purpoſes, and (by that Gentleman's leave) with want of Truth very frequently. I will not then inſiſt upon the bare mode of Language, uſed by this noble Writer, but fairly and impartially ſcan the decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and fitneſs of it, as it relates to the Perſon whom he hath to do with, and as it may be thought to become himſelf.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some think this noble Gentleman hath tranſgreſs'd his own Laws and Rules about <hi>Pedantry,</hi> and whilſt he charges the Doctor with that fault, is guilty of it himſelf, in thoſe <hi>ſcraps of Poetry</hi> which he claps into the front, and into the body
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59345:10"/>
of his Book, in his affected Quotations of others beſides <hi>Roſſcommon;</hi> in his indigeſted Rhapſodies out of <hi>Greek</hi> Authors, in his forced and ſtrain'd Criticiſms, in his ſlighting the beſt and moſt authentick Authority, in his formal dictating every where, in his preſcribing of Maxims and Rules to the World, in his pack of Advices and good Counſels, when there was no need of them. Such trumpery as this is found in the moſt ſlender ſort of Writers, and ſuch as this Gentleman calls <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants.</hi> This is ſome mens ſenſe concerning his <hi>Examination</hi> of Dr. <hi>Bently</hi>'s <hi>Diſſertations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Others think that the <hi>ill-breeding</hi> he objects to the Doctor is his own blemiſh, for they apprehend it ſavours not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much of Gentility and good Manners, to diſparage the <hi>breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of a Perſon of ingenuous Education, and brought up in Societies and Families where that quality is not wanting, and who taught it unto others. And there are thoſe who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that <hi>Doctor of Divinity, Chaplain in ordinary to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, the Kings Library keeper,</hi> (not to mention his Promotion and Dignity in the <hi>Church)</hi> almoſt amount to as great a noiſe as the Title of <hi>Eſquire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Some think (and who can help their thinking?) that Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> offends againſt his own Rules, about <hi>ill-breeding</hi> and <hi>Pedantiſm,</hi> when he mentions Dr. <hi>Bently</hi>'s <hi>dependance</hi> on a great Man, as if that Relation were a diſhonour to him, for be ſure he doth not mention it for his Honour. One would think that for the ſake of that eminent Perſon, that Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on might have been ſpared. But ſome are of Opinion, that this is a kind of revenging of Mr. <hi>L.</hi>'s Cauſe, which they would not do directly on the Biſhop, for writing againſt him, and therefore choſe this oblique way: But I can ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as to that. No man believes there is any great over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus of <hi>breeding</hi> (for that is the word our Author furniſhes us with) in inſiſting on Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s being the <hi>Library-keeper</hi> at St. <hi>James</hi>'s. He did rather call for ſome Deference as he was the <hi>King's Servant</hi> there. Wherefore he that turns this into a Reflection, ſeems not to underſtand the <hi>breeding</hi> of the <hi>Court.</hi> But however, as the Doctor was in <hi>Holy Orders,</hi> he was to have had ſome reſpect paid to him; but even this is mention'd to his diſparagement, which carries little of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59345:11"/>
air and genius of a Gentleman: which is an Argument to perſwade me that ſome body elſe beſides the Honourable Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> had a hand in this work. In ſhort, whoever he was, he gives the Doctor no quarter, he teazes and worries him moſt unmercifully. Mr. <hi>Wotton</hi> hardly eſcapes, for this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor flies at him and his Treatiſe of <hi>Antient and Modern Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and more than once reminds him, that he <hi>hath purged his Book of ſeveral ill Paſſages in this ſecond Edition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> p. 97. letting us know that the former had ſeveral ill Paſſages in it: and he charges this Gentleman likewiſe with <hi>ill manners,</hi> p. 22. and it is a kindneſs that he there ſtopt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The aggravation of all is this, That the greateſt part of all this Raillery is only for a little <hi>Criticiſm.</hi> Who would think that ſuch a ſmall matter ſhould exaſperate Perſons to that height, and warm their Bloods to that degree? It was otherwiſe with the late Combatants we ſpoke of, their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence was in points of an high nature, where indifferency would have been a fault. Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> had reaſon to appear with ſome warmth, when the grand matters of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lay at ſtake, ſuch as concern'd the very life and ſoul of Chriſtianity. Not to mention that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> had treated Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> in a moderate and civil ſtile; and that on the other ſide Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> had not only rudely treated him, but others of the ſame <hi>Function</hi> and <hi>Office,</hi> ſo that he had made it not only a perſonal but a publick Quarrel, which gave ſome warmth to Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>'s Pen.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Thoſe undue <hi>Menaces</hi> and <hi>Threatnings,</hi> which are ſcattered up and down by the <hi>Examinator,</hi> induce me to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline towards Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi>'s Opinion, that Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> was not the entire Compoſer of thoſe Papers: For tho too many that bear the name of <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> are for touching the Hilt preſently if a harſh word be given, yet the noble and religious Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Boyles</hi> allows of no ſuch thing. The angry Criticiſer, who ever he is, gives plain hints of a <hi>ſeverer Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod</hi> to be uſed. In three or four places the Doctor is given to underſtand that if he provokes this Writer, he ſhall feel the force of a ſharper Inſtrument than a Quill: for <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>uſe to revenge their Quarrels in another way than with their Pens.</hi> This is one of the moſt boiſterous <hi>Criticks</hi> that ever I
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:59345:11"/>
met with; he is for hectoring his <hi>Brother Critick</hi> into ſilence or compliance. This is a new way of writing, with Sword or Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonet in hand. This is done certainly to warn our <hi>Clergy</hi> for the future that they write not againſt one ſort of men, leſt they be whipt through the Lungs for their pains. As for the Learned Doctor, you muſt think he fares the worſe for his free Diſcourſes and Sermons againſt the <hi>Deiſts</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> when at the <hi>Boylean Lecture</hi> he ſmote them under the fifth Rib, and therefore 'tis no wonder that he is threatned to be ſerv'd ſo himſelf. Truly I reckon the Doctor to be in an unſafe caſe as to his perſon: and he is in as dangerous a one as to his Books, for I will not ſecure them from an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity Decree,</hi> (for ſome of the ſame hands are at work now that procured the Dean of S. <hi>P.</hi> that favour) no nor from a <hi>warmer Doom,</hi> ſuch as that about the year 1684. But I leave the Doctor to tell his own Story and his Fears; only before I leave off, I will add the <hi>Reflection</hi> of the Town on one or two of the foregoing Adventurers and others, <hi>viz.</hi> into what different poſtures they caſt themſelves, and appear on the Stage. Dr. <hi>South</hi> combats a Brother-Church-man, ſay they; Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> is pleaſant upon a Lay-Gentleman; Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> (as it were to be even with him) rallies upon a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Clergyman; and one too well known to be named, plays upon both Ranks. Hence ſome fanciful Brains ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that theſe <hi>Changes</hi> are thus purpoſely rung by the Preſs: but this is a groundleſs Conceit, and needs no refuting.</p>
            <p>Having ſpoken with this freedom concerning our Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Criticks, let me add ſomething concerning a Foreign one, the Ingenious and Learned Author of <hi>Ars Critica.</hi> He had made himſelf known before by ſeveral of his learned Writings; but we muſt look upon this as his Maſterpiece, not ſo much for the ſuperexcellency of the thing it ſelf, as for the ſubtle contriving and deſigning of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that it ſhould propagate <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> in a new method. Others have in a down-right way promoted the Cauſe, by poſitive handling and determining the particular Doctrines, and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting and arguing againſt the contrary Opinions. But here comes a Gentleman that takes another courſe, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to make Proſelytes by <hi>Critical Art.</hi> For the <hi>Miſſionary</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:59345:12"/>
               <hi>Fathers</hi> have not more ways and arts of gaining Converts in <hi>China,</hi> and the other Pagan Countries they reſort to, than theſe men have of winning over people to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarianiſm.</hi> It is true, <hi>Criticiſm</hi> hath been their chief Province, they have applied themſelves to the ſtudy of <hi>Grammar,</hi> and have made ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in it; but they have miſerably abuſed this ſort of Learning, by making it ſerve their own turns: For which this Author is as eminent as any, but he hath gone to work in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way different from the reſt; for whereas others plainly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly aſſerted the Socinian Opinions, by commenting upon the Books of the New Teſtament, here is another way taken by this Writer in this his laſt Book. One would think he intended only to ſet down the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Criticiſm,</hi> with reſpect to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew, Greek,</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Authors; but the main drift of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking is to eſtabliſh the Doctrines of <hi>Socinus.</hi> It is in an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique and collateral manner that he chuſes to be a Patron of that Cauſe. His Artifice is to ſhape his <hi>Critick</hi> into a <hi>Socinian.</hi> This (which I hope may be of ſome good uſe to the Reader) I will make good by going through the ſeveral parts of his Book, and ſhewing that the various Topicks of <hi>Criticiſm</hi> which he makes uſe of, are ſtrain'd to this purpoſe, namely, to the defence of the <hi>Socinian</hi> Points.</p>
            <p>Part <hi>1.</hi> Chap. <hi>1.</hi> Sect. <hi>3. treating on the Head of</hi> common Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, <hi>he drags in this,</hi> Among the Jews it was thought that Sacrifices were the chief part of Divine Worſhip; therefore in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment all the Offices of Religion are expreſs'd by the name of Sacrifices. And ſo the Death of Chriſt is call'd there a Sacrifice, becauſe it was the chief part of that Religion, and had ſome things in it reſembling Sacrifices. <hi>And then hints, that it was only a</hi> metaphorical <hi>and</hi> improper Sacrifice. <hi>For the ſake of the Doctrine which rejects Chriſt's Satisfaction, this was brought in here under this Head, tho it is plain it hath no reference to it.</hi>

And this is the thing he aims at in what follows in that Chapter, where he alledges ſome of the antient Chriſtian Writers, who make uſe of the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>God,</hi> as it ſignifies ſome worthy and honourable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as <hi>Angels,</hi> or <hi>Magiſtrates)</hi> not the only true God that is to be worſhipp'd.

            </p>
            <p>In the ſame Chapter he ſhews his good will to the <hi>Racovian</hi> Divinity, when he interprets <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 33. of the Memory on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>I will put my Law into their inward parts, and write it in their Hearts;</hi> that is, ſaith he, <hi>I will take care that the</hi> Iſraelites <hi>ſhall retain the Law in their Memories, and ſhall not want a Monitor to put them in mind of it. This is the whole emphaſis of the words.</hi> And to confirm this, he quotes the next words as a proof of what he ſaith, <hi>They ſhall teach no more every man his Neighbour,</hi> &amp;c. but we find nothing of proof in them, there is not the leaſt intimation that the foregoing words are to be meant of bare <hi>remembrance.</hi> But this is the ſlender fare which we muſt expect, when this learned Writer pretends to make the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Proviſion, and to ſatisfy the Readers appetite: Nor can it be otherwiſe when a man of his Parts and Reading truckles to a Cauſe, and ſubmits himſelf to be led by falſe Notions, and (to uphold them) wreſts the Holy Scripture, as he doth here, under a cloak of <hi>Criticiſm.</hi> Any unprejudiced man may be convinced, that the forementioned words are the Covenant or Promiſe of Grace and Salvation by the <hi>Meſſiah. Behold, the days come, ſaith the Lord, that I will make a new Covenant,</hi> ver. 31. and thoſe <hi>days</hi> are the days of the Goſpel, as appears from the occaſion of citing and applying the foreſaid Text, in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59345:13"/>
               <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 8. That <hi>Covenant</hi> is in a more ſignal manner fulfill'd under the Evangelical Diſpenſation, the Divine Law is <hi>put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the inner parts</hi> of the Faithful, and <hi>written on their Hearts;</hi> that is, by virtue of the Holy Spirit their Underſtandings are ſo enlightned, and their Wills and Conſciences ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally wrought upon, that they are enabled to obſerve that Law. This is the privilege of the Evangelical Covenant: but our Author was not to comply with this, becauſe it is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Doctrine of thoſe men he adheres to, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plode all ſpecial Grace and Aſſiſtance of the Spirit, and ſolve all by Moral Swaſion. It is no wonder then, that in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance to thoſe Doctors, he makes <hi>writing the Law in the Heart, and inner parts,</hi> to be no more than bare <hi>remembring</hi> of it. Thus you have his Interpretation, and you have the true ground and occaſion of it. He proceeds to try whether he can by Quotations out of Gentile Writers prove, that <hi>writing in the Mind</hi> or <hi>Heart</hi> is of the ſame ſignification with <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance;</hi> but ſome of his Inſtances which he alledges, come not up to what he quotes them for, and if they did, the <hi>Sacred</hi> and <hi>Pagan</hi> ſtile are not to be parallel'd always, as he himſelf expreſly acknowledges among his <hi>Critical</hi> Obſervations: And as for the Citation out of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> Antiq. 1. 4. c. 8. <hi>The wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Laws on their Minds,</hi> and the <hi>preſerving them in their Memories,</hi> ſeem to be two diſtinct things. The truth is (ſo far as I can judg) this Learned Gentleman ſhapes his <hi>Criticiſm</hi> according to the <hi>Doctrines</hi> he hath imbraced, and that is the ground of his miſtaking here and in other places.</p>
            <p>This may be perceived in his Critical Notes in this ſame Chapter, about <hi>opening the Eyes,</hi> where the deſign was to fetch in <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. <hi>To open their Eyes, and to turn them from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to light;</hi> and then from his premiſed Critical Gloſſes, to inſinuate that there is <hi>no Emphaſis, no Energy,</hi> as he ſaith, in thoſe words. So he continues that there is nothing <hi>Emphatical</hi> in the Apoſtles words concerning <hi>Lydia,</hi> Acts 16. 14. <hi>The Lord opened her Heart.</hi> Her Converſion was not by any ſpecial Power and Efficacy, only (as he ſtrangely expreſſes it) <hi>It was by divine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Providence, whatever machins God made uſe of at laſt, that</hi> Lydia <hi>gave an attentive Ear to</hi> Paul. He tells us that the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful change that was wrought in this Female by the preaching
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59345:13"/>
of the Goſpel was the work of <hi>Providence,</hi> by which <hi>all</hi> other things come to paſs in the World. And it was a <hi>Mechanical</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, for that he muſt mean by his <hi>Machins;</hi> it was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal work, void of an inward efficacious and energetical Principle. This is his way of deſcribing <hi>Lydia's</hi> Converſion to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith, only to ſerve his Hypotheſis about Grace and Converſion: This was the reaſon why our <hi>Critick</hi> would have us take no notice of any <hi>Emphaſis</hi> in thoſe foregoing Phraſes, no not in the writings of the Bible.</p>

               <hi>redemption,</hi> and repreſents theſe as ambiguous and doubtful terms, and hard to be underſtood when they are applied to <hi>Chriſt's Redemption.</hi> And here he perplexes the matter, and renders it difficult and obſcure, and unſettles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and confounds the belief of the weak. It is obſervable he undertakes afterwards to reckon up all the ſignifications of the word <hi>Spirit</hi> in the Old and New Teſtament (as well as in other Writers) but he can't find <hi>one</hi> place where it ſignifies the <hi>third Perſon</hi> in the <hi>Trinity.</hi> He acknowledges indeed that there is mention of the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> in the Old Teſtament, but it is only as much as <hi>God</hi> in general, or a <hi>Divine Power,</hi> or ſome <hi>inviſible force,</hi> not any diſtinct Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Trinity. It is true, he ſaith, <hi>The Chriſtian Divines, both Antient and Modern, fitted or accommodated ſeveral of thoſe places to the Holy Ghoſt, the third Perſon in the Trinity, and ſo do the Divines at this day;</hi> but he is not pleaſed to ſay, that either in the Old or in the New Teſtament, the word <hi>Spirit</hi> doth oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in this ſenſe. No, that was not to be expected, for his method of <hi>Criticiſm</hi> was to be guided by his prepoſſeſſions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the doctrine of the Trinity, or rather his denial of that Doctrin. His whole Catalogue of Places, in Writers that men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the word <hi>Spirit,</hi> ſeems to be inſerted into this Chapter, on purpoſe to patronize that miſtaken Notion, that the Scriptures mention not the <hi>Spirit</hi> as a diſtinct Perſon in the Deity: For this cauſe the divers ſenſes of the word <hi>Spirit</hi> were hook'd in under this Chapter, which treats of <hi>ambiguous words.</hi>

In the next he conſiders the larger and the narrower accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the words <hi>Juſtice</hi> or <hi>Righteouſneſs, Charity, Faith,</hi> but all along ſeems to be upon deſign, and forces his Critical Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations into ſome ſubſervienty to the Principles and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he hath a kindneſs for.</p>
            <p>In the 7<hi>th</hi> Chapter he lays down this Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> That proper words muſt not be confounded with improper ones, and then tells us, that the contrary practice is a common fault; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Apoſtle offends, he ſaith, in this kind, when he ſpeaks thus to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> Chap. 4. 8. <hi>When ye knew not God, ye did ſervice unto them who by nature are no Gods.</hi> Which words are haled in here to prove, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a confuſed and improper Speaker, and to take occaſion to diſcourſe of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, a <hi>God by Nature,</hi> that hereby the Divinity of Chriſt might receive a ſhock. If you ask him what a <hi>God by Nature</hi> is, he anſwers, <hi>One that is not a God by Inſtitution and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi> And yet ſuch was our Saviour, ſay the <hi>Socinian</hi> Maſters, he is a God by divine Inſtitution, Appointment, and Order; this is all the <hi>Divinity</hi> they allow him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. His Criticiſm is again a hackney to his private Belief and Opinion; and thence he brings in <hi>Grace</hi> among the <hi>Obſcure</hi> words that are to be found in Theological Writers; and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes he can't make any ſenſe of it, as it is uſed by St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> and other Divines ſince his time. Why, becauſe it is not according to the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarian Scheme</hi> of Divinity, and therefore there can be <hi>no ſenſe</hi> in the word or thing. It is not then ſtrange that he ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicules that Doctrine, and expoſes it to contempt and ſcorn, making uſe to that purpoſe of a certain <hi>Jeſuit</hi>'s <hi>Dialogue,</hi> which he very ſolemnly quotes. And in the ſame place the Pious and Learned Father St. <hi>Auguſtin</hi> is deſpiſed and vilified as <hi>a popular Speaker, and unskill'd in the Critick Art,</hi> becauſe he vouches the Doctrine of <hi>Grace.</hi> The beſt Language Monſieur <hi>Le Clerc</hi> can give it is, that it is <hi>he knows not what;</hi> which tho ſpoken in a jeering and ſcoffing way, is, ſome fear, the trueſt thing he hath ſaid in this Chapter, or any other.</p>

               <hi>things which they underſtand and not.</hi> Our Lay-Critick is very ſmart upon the Gown. Theſe <hi>Divines,</hi> and theſe <hi>Prieſts</hi> (as they are otherwiſe call'd) are, I perceive, very offenſive to ſome of late, and no wonder, when <hi>they talk Nonſenſe,</hi> and <hi>do not underſtand themſelves what they ſay,</hi> as this Gentleman complains. <hi>And if any man ask of them an interpretation of many of the words they uſe, they reply preſently, that their Diſcourſe is about a thing that is incomprehenſible; and therefore Human Reaſon muſt not paſs judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on things of this nature, as it doth upon others.</hi> Thus our witty Critick, who (as his Brethren) by the <hi>Incomprehenſible thing</hi> mean the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and other Doctrines that have relation to it, which are <hi>Names of Nothing</hi> according to this Writer, nay, (as he diſplays it in great Characters) they are NOTHING, as if his putting any thing into Capital Letters would annihilate it.</p>

On the ſame Principle that his Friends go upon (that all things are clear and plain in Chriſtianity, and that there are no <hi>Myſteries</hi> in it) he upbraids the antient Chriſtian Writers, with their myſtical and obſcure Orations and Diſcourſes. He unhappily joins with <hi>Porphyrius,</hi> the moſt implacable Adverſary of the Chriſtians and Chriſtianity it ſelf (tho <hi>very Learned,</hi> he ſaith) in this very thing, and uſes his words againſt the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Doctors, who interpreted the Holy Scriptures in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive times.</p>

               <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. Having in other places ſpoken ſo contemptuouſly of ſome of the greateſt Points of Religion, it is not to be ſuppoſed that he hath very reverent Thoughts of <hi>GOD</hi> himſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and accordingly he hath this ſtrange Paſſage, <hi>As often as the word</hi> GOD <hi>occurs in any Writer, we muſt know it is always the name of a Notion, which, according to the Wit or Wiſdom of the Writer, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it more or fewer Attributes.</hi>

               <hi>Part</hi> 3. In ſeveral Chapters together he ſhews himſelf a true <hi>Gritick,</hi> in his enquiries about the cauſes of thoſe <hi>Faults</hi> which have crept into <hi>old Writers,</hi> only here and there he hath a brief touch which ſerves to remind us of his inclination. But in the 14<hi>th</hi> Chapter, which is concerning <hi>the Faults that are to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to Impoſtors,</hi> he plainly ſhews his Biaſs in theſe following particulars. He reckons <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 14. among the adulterated Texts, <hi>Death reigned from</hi> Adam <hi>unto</hi> Moſes, <hi>even on thoſe who ſinned not after the ſimilitude of</hi> Adam<hi>'s Tranſgreſſion:</hi> but any one that knows the Opinions of <hi>Socinus</hi>'s Friends, cannot but ſee why <hi>not</hi> is look'd upon as an Interpolation. He numbers <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 5. <hi>God bleſſed for ever,</hi> among the vitiated places, obſerving that the word <hi>God</hi> is not in ſome Copies. Next he inſtances in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>God was manifeſt in the Fleſh,</hi> and remains us that the word <hi>God</hi> is omitted in many Greek Exemplars. Then he takes notice that thoſe words in 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 7. <hi>There are three that bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one,</hi> are not to be found in the old Greek Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, but are foiſted in by fraud: but yet, as he ſaith afterwards, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. <hi>They are contended for, and maintain'd by Divines that have not skill in Criticks, or who look for that in Books which they wiſh for, not for what is in them.</hi> Among the places that have been alter'd and corrupted by Impoſtors, the 4th <hi>ver.</hi> of the Epiſtle of St. <hi>Jude</hi> is reckon'd by him; becauſe <hi>the only Lord God</hi> is meant of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> therefore he adheres to thoſe who ſay <hi>God</hi> is a word inſerted here by fraud. Thus all theſe Allegati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons confirm us in that opinion, which this Author is not unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59345:15"/>
we ſhould have of him, namely, that he is a great admirer of <hi>Socinus</hi>'s Doctrines, and is ambitious of propagating them; and this he doth under the mask of <hi>Criticizing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He concludes all with his <hi>judgment on the Character of a Writer;</hi> and we might do ſo too, and be as ſevere upon him as he is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Curtius,</hi> whom he makes a very ſorry Writer. But as for himſelf, and his Treatiſe of the <hi>Critical Art,</hi> he gives us high Characters of both in ſeveral of his Pages, but chiefly in his <hi>Dedicatory Epiſtle</hi> to his <hi>Teuto,</hi> where he aſſures us, that <hi>he doth not ſwell with Pedagogick Pride, nor is he loaded with a farrage of jejune Learning, but uſes his Judgment and Memory, and is modeſt,</hi> &amp;c. I am as ready as himſelf to heap praiſes on his Head, and to applaud his neat Stile, his great Reading, his vaſt Induſtry, his excellent Remarks on the different undertakings of Authors, his variety of Critical Notions, by which he hath very much obliged the World. But then (that <hi>I</hi> neither may be a <hi>partial Critick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</hi> I muſt needs ſay, he hath diſobliged it much more by his <hi>ſtraining of Criticiſm,</hi> to ſupport a Cauſe which he hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately adopted. And here to make an end, I will obſerve theſe three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is nothing <hi>New</hi> in this Writer which reſpects that Cauſe: He hath not cultivated the Argument at all, no not where every one might have expected it. For who would have thought that ſo induſtrious a Critick, and ſo hearty a well-willer to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarianiſm,</hi> would not have <hi>attempted</hi> at leaſt to return an <hi>Anſwer</hi> to the excellent Arguments uſed by Biſhop <hi>Pearſon</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> to diſprove the Allegations of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> about the adulterating and depraving of ſome of thoſe <hi>Texts</hi> which he hath produced? This would have been a ſeaſonable work, and eſpecially becauſe it properly appertains to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Criticks,</hi> and becauſe it appears from his Writings, that he is not unacquainted with the Works of thoſe eminent Men, and reads them in their own Language. And yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, he makes no effort that ways, nor doth he ſo much as take notice that thoſe excellent Authors have replied to the <hi>Objections</hi> and <hi>Scruples</hi> of the <hi>Socinian</hi> Writers about thoſe Texts. Whence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we may infer, that what thoſe Learned <hi>Anti-Socinians</hi> have ſuggeſted, is unanſwerable, and that one of the ſmarteſt <hi>Criticks</hi> of our days hath nothing to ſay to it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:59345:16"/>
2. We might obſerve how miſchievous and dangerous ſuch Writings as theſe, which not only this Author but others of the ſame Perſwaſion have lately fill'd the World with, may prove to Mankind. We ought to think of this betimes, and to ſhew our reſentment of it, leſt otherwiſe we contribute by our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibleneſs to that Evil which we ſee is approaching. Any man that is not prepoſſeſs'd, may diſcern the Contrivance which is carrying on at this day, namely, to inſtil the notions of <hi>Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm</hi> into the <hi>Youth</hi> of this Age: and accordingly it is obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the Foreign and Engliſh <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nitarians</hi> have induſtriouſly applied themſelves to this rank of Perſons, that is, to thoſe that are coming up in the World. We ſee that their addreſs is very frequent and cloſe to <hi>young</hi> Gentlemen, that by ſowing theſe early Seeds in them, there may be a hopeful Crop expected after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: ſo that tho theſe Seeds-men may not prevail ſo far up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this preſent Generation as they deſire, yet there may be ſome fruit of their labours in the future one. This Learned <hi>Monſieur</hi> is a Tutor to the younger Heads, a Director to them in their Studies, and dedicates his <hi>Criticks</hi> to one of them, and intimates the hopes of the good ſucceſs of his Documents. And truly it is to be mention'd with infinite regret, that theſe Inſtructors have their <hi>Teuto</hi>'s every where, and are very buſily at work with them: ſo among our ſelves, we have ſome that promote Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of a like nature with thoſe, and are employ'd in the <hi>Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of the youth of this Nation. As much as to tell us, that if they cannot ſufficiently proſelyte the men of this Age, they will make ſure of thoſe of the next; if they can't ſucceed at preſent, they will gain Poſterity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I have one thing more to obſerve, and that is this, how harmful a Project it is of our <hi>Critick,</hi> to publiſh Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s <hi>Annotations on the New Teſtament,</hi> and at the ſame time to mix his own <hi>additional Notes</hi> with them. This is a politick way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Cauſe, and eſpecially in <hi>England,</hi> where the Works of that Learned and Pious <hi>Annotator</hi> are in ſo great eſteem: When <hi>his</hi> Criticiſms and Interpretations are blended with the <hi>Socinian</hi> ones, how eaſily will they be both imbibed together? I thought fit to caution my Countrymen about this Hazard, that they may not be betray'd into Error, even the worſt of Errors, whilſt they are intent upon ſtudying the Truth. This is all I have to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:59345:16"/>
ſay at preſent concerning this <hi>French</hi> Author, whoſe Wit and Parts, and acquired Accompliſhments are not of the loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and whoſe <hi>Critical</hi> Genius, if it had been ſet right, would have been extremely ſerviceable to Religion, eſpecially the Chriſtian. But it is his unhappineſs to have taken the wrong Path, and if he goes on after this rate he hath begun, he will criticize a great part of our Religion out of doors.</p>
            <p>I had ſome Thoughts of proceeding to other Authors, ſome of our own Country, as Dr. <hi>Whitby</hi> and Mr. <hi>Norris,</hi> who have duell'd one another about the <hi>Love of the Creature:</hi> I was thinking to examine the <hi>Philoſophick</hi> Champions, as <hi>L. P.</hi> or the <hi>Oxford-Eſſays,</hi> and Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and one or two pair more of the Strugglers of this Age: but theſe may perhaps be the diverſion of another Paper, and it may be will give leſs Offence; for your <hi>Criticks</hi> are very touchy People; and it is very invidious to go a <hi>Socinian-hunting,</hi> as one or two lately have found it.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, I am fully ſenſible what a difficult and arduous work I have been about, no leſs than adjuſting the Debates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Cambridg</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> between the St. <hi>Johns</hi> men on one ſide, and the men of <hi>Chriſt-Church</hi> on the other.</p>
