            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>A Little before in this Chapter you may read, That the Lord JESUS walked on the Sea to go to <hi>Capernaum,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sent his Disciples before in a Ship: But the Winds was contrary, by which means the Ship was hindred in her Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage: Now about the fourth watch of the night, Jesus came Walking upon the Sea, and overtook them; at the sight of whom they were afraid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:47254:3"/>Note, <hi>When Providences are black and terrible to Gods People, the Lord Jesus shews himself to them in wonderful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the which, somtimes they can as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bear, as they can the things that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were terrible to them. They were afraid</hi> of the Wind, and the Water; they were also afraid of their Lord and Saviour, when He appeared to them in that State.</p>
            <p>But He said, <hi>be not afraid, it is I. Note, That the <hi>End</hi> of the appearing of the Lord Jesus unto his people, (though the manner of his appearing be never so terrible) is to alay their fears and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then they received him into the Ship, and immediately the Ship was at the Land whether it went.</p>
            <p>Note, <hi>When Christ is absent from his people, they go on but slowly, and with great difficulty; but when he joyneth himself unto them, Oh! how fast they stear their course, how soon are they at their Journies end!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The people now among whom he last preached, when they saw that both Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus was gon, and his Disciples, they also took shipping and came to <hi>Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum</hi> seeking for Jesus. And when
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47254:3"/>
they had found him, they wondering<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly asked him, <hi>Rabbi, when camest thou hither?</hi> But the Lord Jesus, slighting their complement, answered, <hi>Verily, Verily, ye seek me, not because ye saw the Miracles, but because ye did eat of the Loaves and were filled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Note, <hi>A People may follow Christ far, for base ends, as these went after him beyond - Sea for Loaves; a mans belly will carry him a great way in Religion: yea, a mans belly will make him venture far for Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Note again, <hi>They are not feigning complements, but gracious intentions that crowns the work, in the eye of Christ:</hi> Or thus, <hi>It is not the toyl, and business of professors, but their love to him, that makes him approve of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Note again, <hi>When men shall look for friendly entertainment at Christ's Hand (if their hearts be rotten) even then will they meet with a check and rebuke:</hi> Ye seek me not because ye saw the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, but because ye did eat of the Loaves, and were Filled.</p>
            <p>Yet observe again, <hi>He doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to give, even to these, good counsel; he bids them Labor for the meat that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth to eternal Life.</hi> O how willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:47254:4"/>
would Jesus Christ have even those Professors that come to him with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences only, come to him sincerely, that they may be saved.</p>
            <p>The Text, you will find, is after much more discourse with, and about this people; and it is uttered by the Lord Jesus as the conclusion of the whole, and intimateth, that since they were Professors in pretence only; and therefore such as his soul could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in as such, that he would content himself with a Remnant that his Father had bestowed upon him. As who should say, <hi>I am not like to be Honoured in your Salvation; but the Father hath bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me a people, and they shall come to me in Truth; and</hi> in <hi>them will I be satisfied.</hi> The Text therefore may be called <hi>Christ's repose;</hi> in the fulfilling whereof, he rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himself content, after much Labor, and many Sermon spent, as it were, in vain. As he saith by the Prophet: <hi>I have Labored in vain, I have spent my strength for nought, and in vain,</hi> Isa. 49. 4.</p>
            <p>But as there he saith, <hi>my Judgment is with the Lord, and my work with my God:</hi> So in the Text, he saith, <hi>All the Father giveth me, shall come to me; and them that cometh to me, I will in no wise</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:47254:4"/>
               <hi>cast out.</hi> By these words therefore, the Lord Jesus comforteth himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the consideration of the dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some of his followers.</p>
            <p>He also thus betook himself to <hi>rest</hi> under the consideration of the <hi>little ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> that his Ministry had even in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum, Corazin</hi> and <hi>Bethsaida. I thank thee O Father,</hi> said he, <hi>Lord of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to babes: even so Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight,</hi> Matt. 11. 25. Luke. 10. 21.</p>
            <p>The Text, in the general standeth of two parts, and hath special respect to the Father, and the Son: As also to their joynt management of the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their People. <hi>All that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giveth me, shall come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first part of the Text, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, respecteth the Father and his gift; the other part, the Son and his recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that gift.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> For the gift of the Father, there is this to be considered about it; to wit,</p>
            <p>The gift it self, and that is a gift of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47254:5"/>
certain <hi>persons</hi> to the Son. The Father giveth, and that gift shall come; <hi>And <hi>Him</hi> that cometh.</hi> The gift then is of Persons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Father giveth Persons to Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Next, you have the Sons <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi> of this gift, and that sheweth it self in these particulars.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. In his hearty acknowledgment of it, <hi>to be a gift: The Father giveth me.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. In his taking notice, after a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn manner, of <hi>All,</hi> and <hi>every</hi> part of the gift: <hi>All that the Father giveth me.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>3. In his resolution to bring them to himself. <hi>All the Father giveth me, shall come to me.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. And in his determining, that not any thing shall make him dislike them in their coming. <hi>And him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>These things might be spoken to at large, as they are in <hi>this</hi> method pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to view; but I shall chuse to speak to the words,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. By way of Explication.</item>
               <item>2. By way of Observation.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> By way of Explication. [All] <hi>that the Father giveth me.</hi> This word,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:47254:5"/>
               <hi>All,</hi> is often used in Scripture; and is to be taken more largely, or more strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, even as the Truth, or argument for the sake of which it is made use of, will bare: wherefore, that we may the better understand the mind of Christ, in the use of it here, we must consider, that it is Limited, and Restrained, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to those that shall be Saved; to wit, to those that <hi>shall come to Christ;</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to those that he will, <hi>in no wise cast out.</hi> Thus also the word <hi>
                  <hi>All</hi> Israel,</hi> is sometimes to be taken (though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is taken for the whole Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Jacob.</hi>) <hi>And so <hi>All</hi>
               </hi> Israel <hi>shall be saved,</hi> Rom. 11. By <hi>
                  <hi>All</hi> Israel,</hi> here he intendeth, not <hi>All</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> in the largest sence: <hi>For they are not</hi> All Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el <hi>which are of</hi> Israel; <hi>neither because they are the Seed of</hi> Abraham <hi>are they <hi>All</hi> Children, but in</hi> Isaac <hi>shall thy seed be called: That is, they which are the Children of the flesh; these are not the Children of God, but the Children of the promise are counted for the seed,</hi> Rom. 9. 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>This word, <hi>All,</hi> must therefore be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, and enlarged, as the truth, and argument, for the sake of which it is used, will bare; else we shall abuse
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:47254:6"/>
Scriptures and Readers, &amp; our selves, &amp; <hi>
                  <hi>All.</hi> And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, said Christ, will draw <hi>All</hi> men after me,</hi> Joh. 12. 32. Can any man imagine, that by <hi>All,</hi> in this place, he should mean <hi>All,</hi> and every individual man in the World; and not rather, <hi>That All,</hi> that is consonant to the scope of the place? And if by being lift up from the earth, he means, as he should seem, his being taken up into Heaven; and if by drawing <hi>All</hi> men after him, he meant a drawing of them into that place of Glory: then must he mean, by <hi>
                  <hi>All</hi> Men,</hi> Those, and only Those, that shall in truth be eternally Saved from the Wrath to Come. <hi>For God hath concluded them <hi>All</hi> in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon <hi>All,</hi>
               </hi> Rom. 11. 32. Those intended in this Text, are the <hi>Jews,</hi> even <hi>All</hi> of them, by the first [<hi>All,</hi>] that you find in the words. The second <hi>All</hi> doth also intend the same People; but yet only so many of them as God will have Mercy upon. <hi>He hath concluded them <hi>All</hi> in unbelief, that he might have Mercy upon <hi>All.</hi>
               </hi> The <hi>All</hi> also in the Text, is also to be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and restrained to the Saved, and to them only. But again:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:47254:6"/>
The word [<hi>Giveth</hi>] <hi>or hath given,</hi> must be restrained after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to the same limited number. <hi>All that the Father giveth me.</hi> Not all that are <hi>given,</hi> if you take the <hi>gift</hi> of the Father to the Son, in the largest sence. For in that sence, there are <hi>Many</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to him that shall never come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him. Yea, many are <hi>given</hi> to him, <hi>that he will cast out.</hi> I shall therefore first, shew you the truth of this, and then, in what sence the gift, in the Text, must be taken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That <hi>All</hi> that are given to Christ, if you take the <hi>Gift</hi> of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to him, in the largest sence, cannot be intended in the Text; is evident:</p>
            <p>1. Because, then all the men, yea all the things in the World must be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. <hi>All things, saith he, are delivered unto Me of my Father,</hi> Mat. 11. V. 27. This I think, no rational man in the world, will conclude. Therefore, the Gift intended in the Text, must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to some, to a <hi>Gift</hi> that is <hi>given</hi> by way of <hi>speciality</hi> by the Father to the Son.</p>
            <p>2. It must not be taken for <hi>All,</hi> that in any sence are given by the Father to him; because, the Father hath given
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:47254:7"/>
some, yea, many to him to be dashed in pieces by him. <hi>Ask of me, said the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to him, and I will give thee the Heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session;</hi> But what must be done with them? Must he Save them <hi>All?</hi> No, <hi>Thou shalt brake them with a rod of iron, thou shalt dash them in pieces like a pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters vessel,</hi> Psal. 2. This method he useth not with them that he saveth by his Grace, but with those, that Himself and Saints shall rule over in Justice and Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, (<hi>Rev.</hi> 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 26, 27.) Yet, as you see, <hi>they are given to him.</hi> Therefore the gift intended in the Text, must be restrained to <hi>some;</hi> to a <hi>gift</hi> that is given, by way of <hi>speciality,</hi> by the Father to the Son.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Psalm</hi> 18. he saith plainly, That some are given to him, that he might destroy them. <hi>Thou hast given me the necks of mine enemies, that I might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them that hate me,</hi> ver. 40. These therefore cannot be of the number of those that are said to be given in the Text; for those, even <hi>All</hi> of them shall come to him, <hi>and he will in no wise cast them out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3ly. Some are given to Christ, that he by them might bring about some of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:47254:7"/>
his high and deep designes in the world. Thus <hi>Judas</hi> was given to Christ, to wit, that by him, even as was determined before, he might bring about <hi>His</hi> death, and so the Salvation of his Elect by his Blood. Yea, and <hi>Judas</hi> must so manage this business, as that he must lose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for ever in the bringing of it to pass. Therefore the Lord Jesus, even in his losing of <hi>Judas,</hi> applies himself to the Judgment of his Father, if he had not in that thing, done the thing that was right, even in suffering of <hi>Judas</hi> so to bring about his Masters death, as he might bring about his own eternal Damnation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Those, saith he, that thou gavest me, have I kept, and none of them is lost, but the Son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled,</hi> Joh. 17. 12. Let us then, grant that <hi>Judas</hi> was given to Christ, but not as others are given to him, to wit, not as those made mention of in the Text; for then he should not have failed to have been received by Christ, &amp; kept to Eternal life. Indeed he was given to Christ, but he was given to him to lose him, in the way that I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before; that is, he was given to Christ, that he by him might bring
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:47254:8"/>
about his own death, as was before determined; and that, in the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of him that did it. Yea, he must bring about his Dying for us in the loss of the instrument that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed him, that he might even fulfill the Scripture in his destruction, as well as in the Salvation of the rest. <hi>And none of them is lost, but the Son of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that the Scripture might be fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The gift therefore in the Text, must not be taken in the Largest sence, but even as the Words will bare; to wit, for such a gift as he accepteth, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth to be an Effectual means of their Eternal Salvation. <hi>All that the Father giveth me, shall come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi> Mark, They shall come, <hi>that are in special given</hi> to me, and they shall by no means be rejected. For this is the Substance of the Text.</p>
            <p>Those therefore intended, as the gift, in the Text, they are those that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Covenant to the Son; those that in other places are called the <hi>Elect,</hi> the <hi>Chosen,</hi> the <hi>Sheep,</hi> and the <hi>Children</hi> of the promise, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These be they that the Father hath
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:47254:8"/>
given to Christ to keep them; those, that Christ hath promised Eternal Life unto, those to whom he hath given his Word, and that he will have with him in his Kingdom to behold his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as these Scriptures declare. <hi>This is the will of the Father that sent me, that of all that he hath given me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day. And I give unto them Eternal Life, and they shall never perish; neither shall any man pluck them out of my Hand, my Father that gave them me is Greater than All; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Fathers Hand. As thou hast given him Power over all Flesh, that he should give Eternal Life to as many as thou hast given him. Thine they were, and thou gavest them me, and they have kept thy word. I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for those that thou hast given me; for they are thine. And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Keep through thine own Name, those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are. Father, I will that those whom thou hast given me, may be with me where I am, that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my Glory which thou hast given me;</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:47254:9"/>
               <hi>for thou lovedst me before the Foundation of the World,</hi> John, 6. 39. Chap. 10. 28. Chap. 17. 2, 6, 9, 10, 24.</p>
            <p>All these sentences are of the same import with the Text; and the <hi>Alls,</hi> and <hi>Manies;</hi> those, they, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in these several sayings of Christ, are the same with <hi>All</hi> the given in the Text. <hi>
                  <hi>All</hi> That the Father giveth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that, (as I said before) the word <hi>All,</hi> as also other words, must not be taken in such sort as our foolish fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or groundless opinions will prompt us to, but do admit of an enlargment or a restriction, according to the true meaning and intendment in the Text. We must therefore diligently consult the meaning of the Text by compare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with other the Sayings of God; so shall we be better able to find out the mind of the Lord, in the Word which he has given us to know it by.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <hi>All</hi> that the</hi> [<hi>Father</hi>] <hi>giveth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this word [<hi>Father</hi>] Christ descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth the person giving, by which we may learn several useful things: 1. That the Lord God, and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, is equally concerned with the Son in the Salvation of his People.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:47254:9"/>
True, his acts, as to our Salvation, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers from those of the Son, he was not capable of doing <hi>that,</hi> or <hi>those</hi> things for us as did the Son; he Died not, he Spilt not Blood for our <hi>Redemption</hi> as the Son; but yet he hath a hand, a great hand in our Salvation too. As Christ saith, <hi>The Father himself loveth you,</hi> and his love is manifest in chusing of us, in giving of us to his Son, yea, and in giving his Son also to be a ransom for us. Hence he is called, <hi>The Father of Mercies, and the God of all comfort.</hi> For here even the Father, hath himself found out, and made way for his grace to come to us through the sides, and the heart Blood of his well beloved Son, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 12. The father therefore is to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred and adored as one having a chief hand in the Salvation of sinners. <hi>We ought to give thanks to the Father, who hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Saints in light: for the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the World,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 12. As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so we see in the Text, the <hi>Father giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth</hi> the sinner to Christ to save him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Christ Jesus the Lord by this word <hi>Father,</hi> would <hi>familiarize</hi> this given to us. Naturally the Name of God is dreadful to us, specially when
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:47254:10"/>
he is discovered to us by those names that declare his Justice, Holiness, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and Glory: but now this word <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> is a familiar word, it frighteth not the sinner, but rather inclineth his heart to love, and be pleased with the remembrance of him. Hence Christ also when he would have us pray with Godly boldness, puts this word <hi>Father</hi> into our mouths; Saying, when ye pray, say <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding thereby, that by the <hi>familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> that by such a word is intimated, the Children of God may take more boldness to pray for, and ask great things. I my self have often found that when I can say but this word <hi>Father,</hi> it doth me more good, than when I call him by any other Scripture Name; and 'tis worth your Noting, that to call God by this rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Title, was rare among the Saints in Old Testament times; seldom do you find him called by this name, no, sometimes not in three or four whole books: but now, in New-Testament times, he is called by no name so often as this, both by the Lord Jesus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and by the Apostles afterwards. Indeed the Lord Jesus was he that first made this name common among
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:47254:10"/>
the Saints, and that taught them, both in their Discourses, their Prayers, and in their Writings, so much to use it; it being more pleasing to, and discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring more plainly our interest in God, than any other Expression; for by his one name we are made to understand that all our Mercies are the off-spring of God, and that we also that are called, are his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by adoption.</p>
            <q>All that the Father [giveth.]</q>
            <p>This word [<hi>giveth</hi>] is out of Christs ordinary Dialect, and seemeth to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, at the first sound, as if the Fathers gift to the Son, was not an act that is past, but one that is present and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing; when indeed this gift was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon Christ when the Covenant, the Eternal Covenant was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them before all worlds. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in those other places when this gift is mentioned, it is still spoken of, as of an act that is past. As, <hi>All that He <hi>hath</hi> given</hi> me; to as many as thou <hi>
                  <hi>hast</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> me; Thou <hi>gavest</hi> them me; and those which thou <hi>hast</hi> given me. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of necessity this must be the first and chief sence of the Text. I mean of this word [giveth]: otherwise the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Election, and of the Eternal <hi>Covenant which</hi> was made between the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:47254:11"/>
Father and the Son (in which Covenant, this gift of the Father is most certainly comprized) will be shaken, or at least<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise questionable by erronious and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men.</p>
            <p>But again, this word [<hi>giveth</hi>] is not to be rejected, for it hath its proper use, and my signifie to us;</p>
            <p>First, That though the act of giving, among men doth admit of the time past, or the time to come, and is to be only spoken of with reference to the time: yet with God it is not so. Things past, or things to come, are alwayes present with God, and with his Son Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ: <hi>He calleth things that are not</hi> (that is, to us) <hi>as though they were;</hi> and again, <hi>known unto God are all his works from the foundation of the world.</hi> All things to God are present, and so the gift of the Father to the Son, although to us it is an act that is past, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 17. <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 10.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Christ may Express him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self thus, to shew, that the Father hath not only given him this portion in the Lump, before the world was; but that those that he hath so given, he will give him again: that is, will bring them to him at the time of their conversion; <hi>for</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:47254:11"/>
               <hi>the Father bringeth them to Christ</hi> (Joh. 6. 44.)</p>
            <p>As it is said, <hi>She shall be brought unto the King, in raiment of needle work.</hi> That is, in the righteousness of Christ, for it is God that imputeth that to these that are saved, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45. 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>A man giveth his daughter to such a man, first in order to marriage, and this respects the time past; and he giveth her again at the day appointed, in marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. And in this last sense, perhaps, the Text may have a meaning: that is, that all that the Father hath before the world was, given to Jesus Christ, he giveth them again to him, in the day of their espousals. Or,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In that Christ saith [<hi>giveth</hi>] instead of <hi>hath given,</hi> he may do it to shew, that this gift of the Father, to him, is now as new, as sweet, as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and desirable, as if it had never bin given before.</p>
            <p>Things that are given among men, are oft-times best at first, to wit, when they are new; and the reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, all earthly things war old; but with Christ it is not so: this gift of the Father is not old, and deformed, and unpleasant in his eyes; and therefore to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:47254:12"/>
him 'tis always new. When the Lord spake of giving the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> he saith not, that he <hi>had</hi> given, or <hi>would</hi> give it to them; but thus, <hi>The Lord thy God giveth thee this good Land,</hi> Deut. 9. 6. not but that he had given it to them, while they were in their Fathers, Hundreds of Years before. Yet he saith <hi>now,</hi> he giveth it to them, as if they were now also in the very act of taking possession, when as yet, they were on the other side <hi>Jordane.</hi> What then should be the meaning? Why, I take it to be this: That the Land should be to them alway <hi>as new; as new,</hi> as if they were taking possession thereof but now. And so is the gift of the Father, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the Text, to the Son; it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways new, as if it were alwayes giving.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All that the Father giveth</hi> [<hi>Me.</hi>]</p>
            <p>In those words, you find mention made of two persons, the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son;</hi> the Father giving, and the Son receiving, or accepting of his Gift. This then in the first place, clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrateth, that the Father and the Son, though they, with the Holy Ghost, are one and the same Eternal God; yet as to their personality are
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:47254:12"/>
distinct. The Father is one, the Son is one, the Holy Spirit is one. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is in this Text, mention made but of two of the three, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a word about those two. The <hi>Giver</hi> and <hi>Receiver</hi> cannot be the same person, in a proper sence in the same act of giving and receiving. He that giveth, giveth not to himself but to an other; the Father giveth not to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to wit, to <hi>Himself,</hi> but to the <hi>Son;</hi> the Son receiveth not of the Son, to wit, of <hi>Himself,</hi> but of the Father: so when the Father giveth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he giveth it not to himself but to another; as Christ saith, He hath given <hi>Me</hi> a Commandment, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 49. So again, <hi>I am one that beareth witness of my self, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me Jo.</hi> 10. 18.</p>
            <p>Further, here is something implyed that is not expressed, to wit, that the Father hath not given all Men to Christ; that is, in that sence as is intended in this Text. For then all should be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: He hath therefore disposed of Satan another way. He gives some up to Idolatry, He gives some up to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness, to vile affections, and to a reprobate mind. Now these he dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:47254:13"/>
of in his Anger, for their destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (<hi>Acts.</hi> 7. 42, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 24, 26, 28.) that they may reap the fruit of their doings, and be filled with the reward of their own ways<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But neither hath He thus disposed of all men; he hath even of Mercy reserved some <hi>from</hi> these Judgments, and those are they that he will Pardon, as he saith, <hi>for I will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them whom I reserve,</hi> Jer. 50. 20. Now these he hath given to Jesus Christ by Will, as a Legaey. Hence the Lord Jesus sayes, <hi>This is the Fathers Will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day,</hi> Joh. 36 29.</p>
            <p>The Father therefore <hi>giving</hi> them to Him to save them, must needs by so doing declare unto us these following things.</p>
            <p>1. That he is <hi>Able,</hi> to answer this designe of God, to wit, to save them to the uttermost Sin, the uttermost temptation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Heb. 7. 25. Hence he is said, <hi>To lay help upon me that is Mighty, Mighty to save:</hi> And hence it is again, that God did even of old promise to send <hi>his</hi> people a Saviour; a great one, <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. 19. <hi>Isa.</hi> 63. 1. To save, is a great work, and calls for Almighty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:47254:13"/>
in the Undertaker: hence he is called the Mighty God, the Wonderful Counseller, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sin is strong, Satan is also strong, Death and the Grave are strong, and so is the Curse of the Law; therefore it follows, that this Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus must needs be by God the Father, accounted Almighty, in that he have given his Elect to him, to save them, and to deliver them from these, and that in despite of all their Force, and Power.</p>
            <p>Yea, he gave us Testimony of this his Might, when he was imployed in that part of our deliverance, that called for a Declaration of it. He abolished Death: He destroyed him that had the power of Death; he was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Grave; he hath fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed Sin, and made an end of it, as to its Damning effect upon the Persons that the Father hath given him. He hath vanquished the curse of the Law, Nailed it to his <hi>Cross,</hi> Triumphed over them upon his <hi>Cross,</hi> and made a shew of these things openly, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 15. <hi>Hos.</hi> 13. 14. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14, 15.</p>
            <p>Yea, and even now, as a sign of his Triumph and Conquest, he is alive
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:47254:14"/>
from the Dead, and hath the Keys of Hell and Death in his own keeping, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
            <p>2ly. The Fathers giving of them to him to save them, declares unto us that he <hi>is,</hi> and <hi>will</hi> be faithful in his Office, and that therefore they shall be secured from the fruit or wages of their Sins, which is Eternal Damnation. And indeed it is said, even by the Holy Ghost himself, <hi>That he is faithful to him that appointed him;</hi> that is, to this work of saving those that the Father hath given him, <hi>for that purpose; as</hi> Moses <hi>was faithful in all his House:</hi> Yea, and more faithful too, for <hi>Moses</hi> was faithful in Gods house, but as a Servant. <hi>But Christ as a Son, over his own house,</hi> Heb. 3.</p>
            <p>And therefore this Man is counted worthy of more glory than <hi>Moses,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon this account, because more Faithful than he; as well as because of the dignity of his person. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in him, and in his truth and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, God rested wel - pleased, and hath put all the government of this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon his shoulders. Knowing, that nothing shall be wanting in him, that may any way perfect this design. And
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47254:14"/>
of this, He, to wit the Son, hath already given a proof; for when the time was come, that his Blood was by Divine Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice required for their Redemption, Washing, and Changing: he as freely poured it out of his He<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t, as if it had been Water out of a vessel; not stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to part with his own Life, that the life which was laid up for them in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, might not fail to be bestowed upon them. And upon this account (as well as upon any other) it is, that God calleth him his <hi>righteous servant,</hi> Isa. 53. For his righteousness could never have been compleat, if he had not been to the uttermost faithful to the work which he undertook; It is also, because he is faithful, and true, that in Righteousness he doth Judge and make Work for his peoples deliverance. He will faithfully perform this trust reposed in him: The Father knows this, and hath therefore given his Elect unto him.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Fathers giving of them to Him to save them, declares unto us that he is, and will be gentle and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient towards them under all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations and miscarriages. It is not to be imagined, the tryals and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations that the Son of God hath all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:47254:15"/>
had with these people that have been given to him to save them: indeed he is said to be a <hi>tryed stone,</hi> for he has been tryed, not only by the devil, guilt of sin, death, and the curse of the Law, but also by his peoples ignorance, unruliness falls, into sin, and declining to errors, in life, in Doctrine. Were we but capable of seeing how this Lord Jesus has been tryed, even by this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ever since there was one of them in the world, we should be amazed at his Patience and gentle Carriages to them. It is said indeed, the <hi>Lord is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pitiful, slow to anger, and of great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy:</hi> and indeed, if he had not so been, he could never have indured their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as he has done from <hi>Adam</hi> hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. Therefore is his pitty and bowels to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Church, preferred above the pitty and bowels of a mother towards her Child. <hi>Can a woman forget her sucking Child, that she should not have Compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion on the Son of her Womb? yea they may forget, yet will I not forget thee, saith the Lord,</hi> Isa. 49. 15.</p>
            <p>God did once give <hi>Moses,</hi> as Christs Servant, an handful of this people to carry them in his bosom, but no further than from <hi>Egypt to Canaan;</hi> and this
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:47254:15"/>
               <hi>Moses,</hi> as is said of him by the Holy Ghost, was the Meekest man that was then to be found in the Earth: yea, and he loved the people at a very great rate, yet neither would his meekness nor love hold out in this work; he failed, and grew pationate even to the provoking of his God to Anger under this work that God had laid upon him. <hi>And Moses said unto the Lord, wherefore hast thou afflicted thy Servant?</hi> But what was the affliction? Why the Lord had said unto him, <hi>carry this people in thy bosom as a nursing father beareth the suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing child, unto the Land that he sware unto their fathers.</hi> Not I, sayes <hi>Moses, I am not able to bear all this people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is too heavy for me: if thou deal thus with me, kill me I pray thee out of hand, and let me not see my Wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> Numb. 11. 11, 12, 13, 14. God gave them to <hi>Moses</hi> that he might car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry them in his bosom; that is, that he might shew gentleness and patience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them; but he failed in the work, he could not exercise, because he had not that sufficiency of patience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them: But now, it is said of the person speaking in the Text, <hi>That he shall gather his Lambs with his arm, shall</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:47254:16"/>
               <hi>carry them in his bosom, and shall gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lead them that are with young,</hi> Isa. 40. 10, 11. Intimating, that this was one of the qualifications that God look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, and knew was in him, when he gave his Elect to him to save them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The fathers giving of them to him to save them, declares to us that he hath a Sufficiency of wisdom to wage with all those difficulties that would attend him in his bringing of his Sons and Daughters unto glory; He hath made him <hi>to us</hi> to be Wisdom, yea he is called Wisdom it self; and God saith moreover, that he shall deal pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently. And indeed, he that shall take upon him to be the Saviour of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, had need be Wise, because their adversaries are subtile above any. Here they have to incounter with the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, who for his Subtilty out-witted our Father and Mother when their wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome was at highest (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.) But if we talk of Wisdom, our Jesus is wise, wiser than <hi>Solomon,</hi> wiser than all men, wiser than all the Angels; he is even the Wisdom of God. <hi>Christ the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God</hi> (1 Col. 1.) And hence it is, that he turneth sin, temptation, persecutions, falls, and all things, for
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47254:16"/>
good unto this people, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.)</p>
            <p>Now these things thus concluded on, do shew us also the great, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful love of the Father, in that he should chuse out one every way so well prepared for the work of mans Salvation. Herein indeed perceive we the love of God. <hi>Huram</hi> gathered, <hi>that God loved Israel,</hi> because he had given them such a King as <hi>Solomon,</hi> (2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 2. 11.) But how much more may we behold the love that God hath bestowed upon us, in that he hath given us to his Son, and also given his Son for us?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All that the Father giveth me</hi> [<hi>shall come.</hi>]</p>
            <p>In these last words, there is closely inserted an answer unto the Fathers end in giving of his Elect to Jesus Christ. The Fathers end was, that they might <hi>come</hi> to him, and be <hi>Saved</hi> by him; and <hi>that,</hi> sayes the Son, shall be done: <hi>They</hi> shall <hi>come to me, and him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here therefore the Lord Jesus po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively determineth to put forth a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of all Grace that shall Effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally perform this promise. <hi>They shall come.</hi> That is, he will <hi>cause</hi> them to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:47254:17"/>
come, by infusing of an effectual bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing into all the means that shall be used to that end. As was said to the evil Spirit, that was sent to perswade <hi>Ahab,</hi> to go and fall at <hi>Ramah Gilead. Go, Thou shalt perswade him, and prevail also; go forth and do so,</hi> 1 King. 22. 22. So will Jesus Christ say to the <hi>means</hi> that shall be used for the bringing of those to him that the Father hath given him. I say, he will bless it effectually, to his very end it shall perswade them, and shall prevail also. Else, as I said, the Fathers end would be frustrate. For the Fathers will is, that <hi>of all that he hath given him he should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day,</hi> in order next unto himself, Christ the first-fruits, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards those that are his at his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15) But this cannot be done, if there should fail to be a work of grace effectually wrought, though but in any one of them. But this shall not fail to be wrought in them, even in all that the Father hath given him to save; <hi>All that the Father hath given me, shall come to me,</hi> &amp;c. But to speak more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly to the words; <hi>They shall come.</hi> Two things I would shew you from these words.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:47254:17"/>First, <hi>What it is come to Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>What force there is in</hi> this <hi>promise, to make them come to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, I would shew you first what it is to come to Christ: This word <hi>come,</hi> must be understood spiritually, not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally; for many came to him carnally, or bodily, that had no saving advantage by him; multitudes did thus come unto him in the days of his flesh, yea innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable companies. There is also at this day a Formal, customary Coming to his Ordinances, and ways of Worship, which availeth not any thing: I shall not now medle, for they are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the Text. The Coming then, intended in the Text, is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the <hi>Coming of the</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>unto him, even the moving of the heart to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him. I say, the moving of the heart towards him, from a sound Sense of the absolute want that a man hath of him for his Justification and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Description of Coming to Christ, divideth it self into two heads.</p>
            <p>First, <hi>That coming to Christ, is a moving of the mind towards him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That it is a moving of the mind towards him from a Sound Sense of</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:47254:18"/>
               <hi>the absolute want that a man hath of him for his Justification and Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To speak to the first, That it is a moving of the mind towards him. This is evident, because coming hither or thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it be voluntary, is by an act of the will; so coming to Christ, is through the inclining of the will. <hi>Thy people shall be willing,</hi> Psal. 110. 3. This willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of heart, is it, which sets the mind a moving after, or towards him. The Church expresseth this moving of her mind towards Christ, by the moving of her bowels: <hi>My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my Bowels were moved for him</hi> Song. 5. 4. My bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els; the passions of my mind and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which passions of the affections, are expressed by the yerning, and sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the bowels. The yerning or pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate working of them, the Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, or their making an Noise for him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43. 30. 1 <hi>King</hi> 3. 26. <hi>Isa.</hi> 16. 11.</p>
            <p>This then is the coming to Christ, even a moving towards him with the minde. <hi>And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which moveth whithersoever the water shall come, shall live.</hi> Ezek. 47. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:47254:18"/>The water, in this Text, is the Grace of God, in the Doctrine of it: the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things, are the Children of men to whom this Grace of God, by the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is preached: now saith he, <hi>Every liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing which moveth whithersoever the waters shall come, shall live.</hi> Now see how this word moveth is Expounded by Christ himself in the Book of the Revelations: <hi>The Spirit and the Bride say, come. And let him that heareth, say, come. And let him that is athirst, come. And whosever will, that is willing, let him take the water of life freely,</hi> Revel. 22. 17.</p>
            <p>So that, to move in thy mind and will after Christ, is to be coming to him. There are many poor souls that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Christ, that yet cannot tell how to believe it; because they think, that coming to him, is some strang and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull thing: and indeed so it is; but I mean, they overlook the inclination of their will; the moving of their mind, and the sounding of their bowels after him: and count these none of this strang and wonderful thing: when indeed it is a work of greatest wonder in this world, to see a man who was sometimes dead in sin, possessed of the devil, an enemy
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:47254:19"/>
to Christ, and to all things spiritually good. I say, to see this man moving with his minde after the Lord Jesus Christ, is one of the highest wonders in the world.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>It is a moving of the minde towards him, from a Sound Sense of the absolute want that a man hath of him for his Justification and Salvation.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, without this Sense of a lost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, without him there will be no moving of the mind towards him: a moving of their mouth there may be, <hi>with their mouth they shew much love,</hi> Ezek. 32. Such a people as this will come, as the true people cometh; that is in shew, and outward appearance: and they will sit before Gods Ministers, as <hi>his people Sit before them; and they will hear his words too, but they will not do them:</hi> that is, will not come inwardly with their mindes; <hi>for with their mouth they shew much love, but their heart</hi> (<hi>or</hi> minde) <hi>goeth after their Covetousness.</hi> Now all this is, because they want an effectual sense of the misery of their state by nature; for not till they have that, will they in their minde move af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him. <hi>Therefore, thus it is said Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the true Commers. At that day</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:47254:19"/>
               <hi>the great Trumpet shall be blown, and <hi>They</hi> shall come which were ready to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish in the Land of</hi> Assyria, <hi>and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casts of the land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and shall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship the Lord in his Holy Mountaine at</hi> Jerusalem, (Isa. 27. 13.) They are then you see, the out casts, and those that are ready to perish, that indeed have their mindes Effectually moved to come to Jesus Christ. <hi>This sense of things,</hi> was that which made the three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand come, that made <hi>Saul</hi> come, that made the Jaylor come, and that indeed makes all others come, that come Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. Chap. 8 and 16.</p>
            <p>Of the true coming to Christ, the three Leapers were a famous Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, of whom you read in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7. 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The famine in those days was sore in the Land, there was no bread for the people; and as for that Sustinence that was, which was <hi>Asses</hi> Flesh, and <hi>Doves</hi> Dung that was only in <hi>Samaria;</hi> &amp; of these the Leapers had no share, for they were thrust without the City. Well, now they sat in the Gate of the City; and hunger was, as I may say, making his last Meal of them; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore half dead already, what do they think of doing? why, first they
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47254:20"/>
display the dismal colours of death be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore each others faces, and then resolve what to do, saying, <hi>If we say we will go into the City, then the famine is in the City, and we shall die there; if we sit sti here, we die also; now therefore <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> and let us fall into the Host of the Syrians; if they save us alive, we shall live; if they kill us, we shall but die.</hi> Here now was necessity at work, and this necessity drove them to go thither for life, whether else they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have gon for it. Thus it is with them that in truth come to Jesus Christ: Death is before them, they see it and feel it; he is feeding upon them, and will eat them quite up, if they come not to Jesus Christ; and therefore they come even of necessity, being forced thereto by that Sense they have of their being utterly and everlastingly undone, if they find not safety in him.</p>
            <p>These then are they that will come: indeed these are they that are invited to come. <hi>Come unto me all ye that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, and are Heavy Laden, and I will give you rest,</hi> Matt. 11. 28.</p>
            <p>Take two or three things to make this more plain, to wit, that coming to Christ, floweth from a sound sense of the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47254:20"/>
need that a Man hath of him, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>They shall come with Weeping, &amp; with Supplication will I lead them; I will cause them to walk by the Rivers of Waters in a plain way, wherein they shall not stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> Jer. 31. 9. Mind it, they come with Weeping and Supplication; they come with Prayers, and Tears. Now Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Tears, are the effects of a right Sense of the need of Mercy. Thus a senseless Sinner cannot Come, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Pray, he cannot Cry, he cannot come sensible of what he sees not, nor feels. <hi>In those Days, and at that time, the Children of</hi> Israel <hi>shall come; they and the Children of</hi> Judah <hi>together, going &amp; weeping: they shall seek the Lord their God: they shall ask the way to</hi> Zion <hi>with their Faces thitherward, saying, come and let us joyn our selves to the Lord in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Covenant that shall not be forgotten,</hi> Jer. 50. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This coming to Christ, it is called a running to him, as flying to him; a flying from Wrath to come. By all which Termes, is set forth the sense of the man that comes, to wit, That he is affected with the sense of his sin, and the Death due thereto; that he is sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47254:21"/>
that the avenger of Blood pursues him, and that therefore he is cut off, if he makes not speed to the Son of God for Life; <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>Psal.</hi> 143. 9. Flying is the last work of a man in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, all that are in danger do not Fly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No, not all that see themselves in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: flying is the last work of a man in danger: all that hear of danger will will not fly. Men will consider if there be no other way of escape, before they Fly. Therefore, as I said, flying is the last thing. When all Refuge fails, and a man is made to see that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing left him but Sin Death and Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, unless he flyes to Christ for Life: then he flies, and not till then.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the true coming is, from a sense of an absolute need of Jesus Christ to save, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is evident by the <hi>Out-cry</hi> that is made by them that come, even as they are coming to him; <hi>Lord save or I perish; Men and Brethren what shall we do; Sirs what must I do to be saved,</hi> and the like. This Language doth sufficiently discover that the truly coming Souls, are Souls sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of their need of Salvation by Jesus Christ; and moreover, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else that can help them but Christ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:47254:21"/>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is yet further evident, by these few things that follow, it is said that such are <hi>pricked in their Hearts,</hi> that is, with the sentence of Death by the Law, and the least prick in the Heart kills a Man, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37. such are said, as I said before, to <hi>Weep,</hi> to <hi>Tremble,</hi> and to be <hi>astonished</hi> in themselves at the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and unavoidable danger that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends them, unless they fly to Jesus Christ, <hi>Acts</hi> 9 <hi>chap.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Coming to Christ is atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with an honest, and sincere forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of all for him. <hi>If any Man come to me, and hate not his Father, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Wife, and Children, and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and Sisters, yea, and his own Life also, he cannot be my Disciple; And whosoever doth not bear his Cross, and come after me, cannot be my Disciple,</hi> Luk. 14. 26, 27.</p>
            <p>By <hi>these,</hi> and <hi>the like</hi> expressions else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, Christ describeth the true Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or the man that indeed is coming to him; he is one that casteth all behind his Back; he leaveth all he forsaketh all, he hateth all things that would stand in his way to hinder his coming to Jesus Christ. There are a great many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Commers to Jesus Christ in the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47254:22"/>
World. And they are much like to the man that you read of in (<hi>Matt.</hi> 21. 30.) that said at his Fathers bidding, <hi>I go Sir, and went not.</hi> I say, there are a great many such Commers to Jesus Christ; they say, when Christ calls by his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>I come Sir,</hi> but still they abide by their Pleasures, and carnal Delights. They come not at all, only they give him a Courtly Complement; but he takes notice of it, and will not let it pass for any more than a Lie. He said, <hi>I go Sir, and went not,</hi> he dissembled and lied. Take heed of this, you that flatter your selves with your own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivings words will not do with Jesus Christ: coming is coming, and nothing else will go for coming with him.</p>
            <p>Before I spake to the other Head, I shall answer some Objections that usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally lie in the way of those that in Truth are coming to Jesus Christ.</p>
            <div n="1" type="objection">
               <head>Objection <hi>I.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <hi> Though I cannot deny, but my mind runs after Christ, and that too as being moved thereto from a sight, and consideration of my lost Condition (For I see without him I perish): yet I fear my ends are not right in coming to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:47254:22"/>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> Why? what is thine end, in coming to Jesus Christ?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer,</hi> My end, is, that I might have Life, and be saved by Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>This is thy Objection; well, let me tell thee, that to come to Christ <hi>for Life, and to be saved:</hi> though at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thou hast no other end, is a lawful, and good coming to Jesus Christ. This is evident, because Christ propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>Life,</hi> as the only Argument to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with sinners to come to him, and also blameth them because they come not to him for <hi>Life. And ye will not Come to me that ye might have Life,</hi> Joh. 5. Besides, there are many other Scriptures whereby he allureth Sinners to come to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which he propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth nothing to them but their safety. As, <hi>He that believeth in him, shall not perish; he that believeth, is passed from Death to Life. He that believeth, shall be Saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned.</hi> And believing, &amp; coming, are all one. So that you see, to Come to Christ for Life, is a lawful coming, and good.</p>
               <p>And let me add over and above, that for a man to come to Christ <hi>for Life,</hi> though he comes to him for nothing else
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:47254:23"/>
                  <hi>but Life:</hi> he gives much honour to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> He Honoureth the Word of Christ, and consenteth to the Truth of it, and that in these two general Heads.</p>
               <p>1. He Consenteth to the Truth of all those sayings, that Testifieth that Sin is most abominable in it Self, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable to God, and damnable to the Soul of Man, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 23. Chap. 6. 23. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
               <p>2. In that he believeth, as the Word hath said, that there is in the Worlds best things, Righteousness and all, Nothing but Death and Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24, 25. Chap. 8. 2, 3. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He Honoureth Christs Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, in that he believeth, that there is Life in Him, and that he is able to Save him from Death, Hell, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and Damnation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 24, 25.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He Honoreth him, in that he believeth that he is Authorized of the Father to give Life to those that come to him for it, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 11, 12. Chap. 17. 1, 2, 3.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He Honoureth the Priest-Hood of Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>1. In that he believeth, that he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:47254:23"/>
hath made Attonement for Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p>2. In that he believeth, that Christ hath more Power to Save from Sin by the Sacrifice that he hath Offered for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than hath all Law, Devils, Death, or Sin to Condemn, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 38. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 15. <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 17, 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In that he believeth that Christ, according to his office, will be most faithfull, and mercifull in the discharge of his office, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17, 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Further, he that cometh to Jesus Christ for life, taketh part with him against Sin, and against all the rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and imperfect righteousness of the world; yea, and against false Christs, and damnable errors that set themselves against the worthiness of his merits and sufficiency.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Therefore, as <hi>Noah,</hi> at Gods command, thou preparest this Ark, for the saving of thy self, by the which also thou condemnest the world, and art become Heir of the righteousness which is by faith, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 7.) Wherefore coming sinner, be content; he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Jesus Christ, believeth too that he his willing to shew mercy to, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:47254:24"/>
to have Compassion upon him (though unworthy) that comes to him for life. And therefore thy Soul lieth not only under a special Invitation to come, but under a Promise too of being accepted and forgiven <hi>Mat</hi> 11. 28.</p>
               <p>All these particular parts, and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of faith, are in that Soul that comes to Jesus Christ for Life, as is evident to any indifferent Judgment.</p>
               <p>For, will he that Believeth not the Testimony of Christ concerning the baseness of Sin, &amp; the insufficiency of the Righteousness of the World, come to Christ for Life? No.</p>
               <p>He that believeth not this Testimony of the word, <hi>comes not:</hi> He that believeth that there is Life any where else, <hi>comes not:</hi> He that questions whether the Father hath given Christ power to forgive, <hi>comes not:</hi> He that thinketh that there is more in Sin, in the Law, in Death, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, to Destroy, than there is in Christ to Save, <hi>comes not:</hi> He also that questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons his faithful Management of his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Priesthood for the salvation of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>comes not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thou then that art indeed the <hi>come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Sinner, believest all this. True, perhaps thou dost not believe with
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:47254:24"/>
that full Assurance: nor hast thou lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to take Notice of thy Faith as to these Distinct acts of it: But yet all this Faith is in him that cometh to Christ for Life. And the Faith that thus Worketh, is the Faith of the best and purest kind; because this Man comes alone as a Sinner, and as seeing that Life is, and is to be had, only in Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Before I conclude my Answer to this Objection, take into thy consideration these two things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That the Cities of Refuge, were Erected for their sakes that were dead in Law, and that yet would live by grace; even for those that were to fly thither for life from the avenger of blood that pursued after them. And it is worth your Noting, that those that were upon their flight thither, are in a peculiar manner called the people of God. <hi>Cast ye up, Cast ye up, saith God, prepare ye the way, take up the stumbling blocks out of the Way of My people,</hi> Isa. 57. 14. This is meant of preparing the way to the City of refuge, that the slayers might escape thither, and live; which slayers are here by way of speciality called the people
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:47254:25"/>
of God: even those of them that es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped thither for life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Consider that of <hi>Ahab,</hi> when <hi>Benhadad</hi> sent to him for life, saying, <hi>Thus saith thy Son Benhadad, I pray thee let me live.</hi> Though <hi>Benha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad</hi> had sought the Crown Kingdom, yea and also the life of <hi>Ahab;</hi> yet how effectually doth <hi>Benhadad</hi> prevaile with him. Is <hi>Benhadad</hi> yet alive? said <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab,</hi> he is my brother; yea, go, ye, bring him to me: so he made him ride in his Chariot 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20 chap.</p>
               <p>Coming Sinner what thinkest thou? if Jesus Christ, had as little Goodness in him as <hi>Ahab,</hi> he might grant an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Benhadad</hi> life; thou neither beggest of him his Crown or Dignity: Life, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life will serve thy turn: how much more then shalt thou have it, since thou hast to deal with him who is goodness and mercy it self; yea since thou art also called upon, yea greatly encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by a promise of life, to come to him for Life. Read also these Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. 11, 14, 15. <hi>Josh.</hi> 20. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.</p>

               <head>Objection 2.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>When, I say, I only seek my self, I mean, I do not find that I do design Gods Glory in mine own Salvation by Christ, and that makes me fear, I do not come aright.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answer,</hi> Where doth Christ Jesus require such a Qualification, of those that are coming to him for Life? come thou for Life, and trouble not thy head with such Objections against thy Self, and let God and Christ alone to Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify themselves in the Salvation of such a worm as thou art. The Father saith to the Son, <hi>Thou art my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, O</hi> Israel, <hi>in whom I will be Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryfied.</hi> God, propoundeth Life to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as the argument to prevail with them to come to him for Life; and Christ sayes plainly, <hi>I am come, that ye might have Life,</hi> John 10. 10. He hath no need of thy designes, though thou hast need of his. Eternal Life, pardon of Sin, and Deliverance from Wrath to come, Christ propounds to thee, and these be the things that thou hast need of; besides, God will be gracious, and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to worthless, undeserving wretches;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:47254:26"/>
come then as such an one. Therefore lay no stumbling blocks in thy way to him, but come to him for life, &amp; live, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 34. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. 10. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 36. <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 36, 37. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 25, 26.</p>
               <p>The Jayler was only for knowing at first, what he should do to be Saved: But <hi>Paul</hi> did not so much as once ask him, what is your <hi>End,</hi> in this Question; do you design the Glory of of God in the Salvation of your Soul? He had more wit; he knew that such Questions as these would have bin but Fools bables about, instead of a sufficient salve, to so weighty a Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as this was. Wherefore since this poor wretch lacked Salvation by Christ; I mean, to be saved from Hell and Death, which he knew (now) was due to him for the sins that he had committed: <hi>Paul</hi> bids him, like a poor condemned sinner as he was, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed still in this his way of self-seeking: saying, <hi>Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shall be saved.</hi> Acts 16. 30, 31, 32.</p>
               <p>I know, that afterwards, thou wilt desire to glorifie Christ, by walking in the way of his precepts; but at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent thou wantest life; the avenger of

blood is behind thee, and the devil like a Lyon is roaring against thee: well, come now, and obtain life from these; and when thou hast obtained some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable perswasion that thou art made partaker of life by Christ, then, and not tell then, thou wilt say, <hi>Bless the Lord O my Soul, and all that is within me bless his holy name. Bless the Lord O my Soul, and forget not all his benefits. Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, and healeth all thy diseases; who redeemeth thy life from distruction, and Crowneth thee with loving kindness, and tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi> Psal. 103. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi> But I cannot believe that I come to Christ aright, because, sometimes, I am apt to question his very Being, and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to save.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus to do is horrible: but may'st thou not Judge amiss in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How can I Judge amiss, when I Judge as I feel?</hi> Poor Soul! thou maist Judge amiss for all that. Why, I think that these questionings come from my Heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:47254:27"/>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Let me answer. That which comes from thy heart, comes from thy <hi>will</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> from thy <hi>understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Judgement</hi> and <hi>Conscience.</hi> For these must acquiess in thy questioning, if thy questioning be with thy heart. And how say'st thou, (for to name no more) dost thou with thy Affection and Conscience thus question?</p>
               <p>Answ. <hi>No, my Conscience trembles when such thoughts come in to my mind, and my affections are otherwise inclined.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then I conclude, that these things are either suddenly injected by the devil, or else are the fruits of that body of sin and death that yet dwels in thee, or perhaps from both together.</p>
               <p>If they come wholly from the devil, as they seem, because thy Conscience and affections are against them; or if they come from that body of death, that is in thee (and be not thou curious in enquiring from whether of them they come, the safest way is to lay enough at thy own door) nothing of this should hinder thy coming, nor make thee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thou comest not aright.</p>
               <p>And before I leave thee, let me a little query with thee farther about this matter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:47254:27"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Doest thou like these wicked blasphemies?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> No, no: their presence and working kills me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Doest thou mourn for them, pray against them, and hate thy self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, yes: but that which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts me, is, I do not prevail against them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Dost thou sincerely chuse, (mightest thou have thy choice) that thy heart might be affected and taken with the things that are best, most heavenly, and holy?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> With all my heart, and death the next hour, (if it were Gods will) rather than thus to sin against him.</p>
               <p>Well then, thy not liking of them, thy mourning for them, thy praying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, and thy loathing of thy self because of them, with thy sincere chusing of those thoughts for thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation that are heavenly, and holy: clearly declares that these things are not countenanced either with thy Will, Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, Understanding, Judgement or Conscience; and so, that thy heart is not in them, but that rather they come im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly from the devil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or arise from the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:47254:28"/>
body of death that is in thy flesh: of which thou oughtest thus to Say, <hi>Now then, it is no more I that doth it, but sin that dwells in me.</hi> Rom 7. 16, 17.</p>
               <p>I will give thee a pertinent instance. In <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. Thou mayest read of a betrothed damsel, one betrothed to her beloved; one that hath given him her heart and mouth, as thou hast given thy self to Christ; yet she was met with as she walked in the field, by one that forced her, because he was stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than she. Well, what judgment now doth God the righteous judge pass upon the damsel for this? <hi>The man on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that lay with her, saith God, shall die; but unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the damsel no sin worthy of death. For as when a man riseth against his Neighbor, and slayeth him, even so is this matter: he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cryed, and there was none to save her.</hi> Deut. 22. 25, 26, 27.</p>
               <p>Thou art this damsel, the man that forceth thee with these blasphemous thoughts, is the devil; and he lighteth upon thee in a fit place, even in the field, as thou art wandering after Jesus Christ; but thou cryest out, and by thy
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:47254:28"/>
cry, did'st shew that thou abhorrest such wicked leudness. Well, the Judge of all the earth will do right, he will not lay the Sin at thy door, but at his that offered the violence: and for thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, take this into consideration also, <hi>That he came to heal them that are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed with the devil,</hi> Acts 10. 38.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But saith another, I am so heartless, so slow, and, as I think, so indifferent in my coming, that, to speak truth, I know not whether my kind of coming, ought to be called a coming to Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> You know that I told you at first, that coming to Christ, is a moving of the heart, and affections towards him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But,</hi> saith the Soul, my dulness, and indifferency in all holy Duties, demonstrate my heartlesness in coming: and to <hi>come,</hi> and <hi>not</hi> with the heart, signifies nothing at all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The moving of the heart af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Christ, is not to be discerned (at all times) by thy sensible, affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate performing of duties; but rather by those secret groanings, and complaints
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:47254:29"/>
which thy soul makes to God against that sloth that attends thee in Duties.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> But grant it to be even as thou say'st it is, that thou <hi>comest so slow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> &amp;c. yet since Christ bids them come, that comes not at all; surely they may be accepted that come, though atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with those infirmities, which thou at present groanest under. He saith, <hi>And him that cometh:</hi> he saith not, if they come sensibly so fast: But, <hi>And him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.</hi> He saith also in the Eighth of the <hi>Proverbs, As for him that wanteth <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding;</hi>
                  </hi> that is, an heart, for oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the understanding is taken for the heart. <hi>
                     <hi>Come,</hi> eat of my bread, and drink of the wine that I have Mingled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Thou may'st be vehement in thy spirit, in coming to Jesus Christ, and yet be plagued with sensible sloth. So was the Church, when she cryed, <hi>Draw me, we will run after thee.</hi> And <hi>Paul,</hi> when he said, <hi>When I would do good, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is present with me</hi> (Song 1. 4. Rom. 7.) The works, strugglings and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions of the Flesh, <hi>are more manifest,</hi> than are the works of the Spirit in our hearts, and so are sooner felt, than they. What then, let us not be discouraged
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:47254:29"/>
at the sight, and feeling of our own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, but run the faster to Jesus Christ for Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Get thy heart warmed with the sweet promise of Christs acceptance, of the coming sinner, and that will make thee make more hast unto him. Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging thoughts, they are like unto cold weather, they benumb the senses, and make us go ungainly about our business; but the sweet and warm gleads of the promise, are like the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble beams of the Sun, which liven and refresh. You see how little the <hi>Bee</hi> and <hi>Flye</hi> do play in the Air in Winter; why, the cold hinders them from doing of it; but when the Wind and Sun is warm, who so busie as they?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> But again, he that comes to Christ, flyes for his life: now there is no man that Flyes for his life, that thinks he speeds fast enough on his Journey; no, could he, he would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly take a mile at a step. Oh I come not fast enough, say'st thou: Oh my sloth and heartlesness, say'st thou. <hi>O that I had wings like a dove, for then would I flee away, and be at rest—I would hasten mine escape from the windy storme and tempest,</hi> Psal. 55. 6, 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:47254:30"/>Poor coming Soul, thou art like the man that would ride full gallop, whose horse will hardly trot: now the desire of his minde, is not to be judged of, by the slow pace of the dull jade he rides on; but by the hitching and kick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Spurring, as he sits on his back. Thy flesh is like this <hi>dull <hi>Jade,</hi>
                  </hi> it will not Gallop, after Christ. It will be backward, though thy soul and heaven lies at stake; but be of good comfort, Christ judgeth not according to the fierceness of outward motion (<hi>Mark</hi> 10. 17.) but according to the sincerity of the heart, and inward parts. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 47. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 41.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly, Ziba</hi> in appearance came to <hi>David</hi> much faster than did <hi>Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth:</hi> but yet his heart was not so up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in him to <hi>David</hi> as was his. Tis true, <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> had a Check from David, <hi>Why wentest thou not with me Mephibosheth,</hi> said he; but when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> come to Remember that Mephibo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth was <hi>Lame</hi> (for that was his plea) <hi>Thy Servant is Lame,</hi> 2 Sam. 19. he was content, and concluded he would have come after him faster than he did: And <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> appealed to <hi>David,</hi> who was in those days as an Angel of God to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:47254:30"/>
know all things that are done in the earth, if he did not believe that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his backwardness lay in his <hi>Lameness,</hi> not his mind. Why poor coming sinner, thou canst not come to Christ with that outward fierceness of <hi>Carrear,</hi> as many others do; but doth the reason of thy backwardness lie in thy mind, and will, or in the sluggish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the flesh? canst thou say sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>The Spirit truly is willing, but the flesh is weak?</hi> Mat. 26. 41. yea, canst thou appeal to the Lord Jesus, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth perfectly the very inmost thought of thy heart; that this is true, then take this for thy comfort, he hath said, <hi>I will assemble her that halteth, I will make her that halteth a remnant, and I will save her that halteth</hi> (Mich. 4. 6, 7. Zeph. 3. 19.) what canst thou have more from the sweet lips of the Son of God? But.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> I read of some that are to follow Christ in Chains; I say, to come after him in <hi>Chaines, Thus saith the Lord, the labor of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and the Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize of</hi> Ethiopia, <hi>and the</hi> Sabeans, <hi>men of stature, shall come over unto thee, and they shall be thine: They shall come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thee; in Chaines shall they come over, and they shall fall down unto thee, they</hi>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:47254:31"/>
                  <hi>shall make Supplication unto thee; saying, surely there is none else to save.</hi> Isa. 45, 14. Surely they that come after Christ in Chaines, come to him in great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, because their steps, by their chaines, are straightened.</p>
               <p>And what Chaines so heavy, as those that discourage thee; thy Chain which is made up of guilt and filth is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy; it is a wretched bond about thy neck, by which thy strength doth fail (<hi>Lam.</hi> 1. 14. chap. 3. 17.) But come, though thou comest in chaines, 'tis glory to Christ that a sinner come after him in Chaines. The blind man, though called, surely could not come apace to Jesus Christ, but Christ could stand still, and stay for him. True, he rideth upon the Wings of the Wind: But yet he is long Suffering, and his long Suffering is Salvation to him that cometh to him. <hi>Mark.</hi> 10. 49. 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 3. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Hadest thou seen those that came to the Lord Jesus in the days of his flesh, how slowly, how hobblingly they come to him by reason of their infirmities; and also how friendly, and kindly, and graciously he received them, and gave them the desire of their hearts, thou wouldest not, as thou dost, make

                  <hi>But (sayes another) I fear I come too late, I doubt I have stayed too long, I am afraid the Door is Shut.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Thou canst never come too late to Jesus Christ, <hi>if Thou dost come.</hi> This is manifest, by two instances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> By the Man that came to him at the Eleventh Hour. This Man was Idle all the day long: He had a whole Gospel day to come in, and he play'd it all away, save only the last hour thereof. But at last, at the Eleventh Hour he came, and goes into the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard to Work with the rest of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, that had born the Burden, and heat of the day. Well, but how was he received of the Lord of the Vineyard? Why, when pay - day came, he had even as much as the rest, yea had his mony first. True, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Murmured at him, but what did the Lord Jesus Answer them? <hi>Is thine Eye Evil because mine is Good? I will give to this last even as unto thee,</hi> Mat. 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The other instance is, <hi>The Thief upon the Cross:</hi> He came late al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, even as at an Hour before his
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:47254:32"/>
Death; yea, he stayed from Jesus Christ, as long as he had liberty to be a Theif, and longer too; for could he have deluded the Judge, and by lying words, have escaped his Just Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; for ought I know, he had not come as yet, to his Saviour: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Convicted, and Condemned to Die; yea, fastned to the Cross, that he might Die like a Rogue, as he was in his Life; behold the Lord Jesus, when this wicked one, <hi>even now,</hi> desireth Mercy at his Hands, tells him, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least reflexion upon him, for his former Mis-spent Life, <hi>To Day thou shalt be with me in Paradice,</hi> Luke 23. 43.</p>
               <p>Let no Man turn this Grace of God into Wantonness; my design is now to encourage the coming Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But is not the Door of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy Shut against some before they Die?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes. And God forbids that Prayers should be made to him for them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 16. <hi>Jud.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>Quest. <hi>Then, why may not I doubt that I may be one of these?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> By no means, if thou art com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Jesus Christ; because when God Shuts the Door upon Men, he gives them no heart, to come to Jesus Christ.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:47254:32"/>
                  <hi>None comes, but those to whom it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the Father:</hi> But thou comest, therefore it is given to thee of the Father.</p>
               <p>But sure therefore, if the Father hath given thee an Heart to come to Jesus Christ, the Gate of Mercy yet stands Open to thee: For it stands not with the Wisdom of God, <hi>To give strength to come to the Birth, and yet to Shut up the Womb,</hi> Isa. 66. 9. to give grace to thee to come to Jesus Christ, and yet Shut up the Door of his Mercy upon thee. <hi>Encline your Ear, saith he, come unto me, hear, and your Souls shall Live; And I will make an Everlasting covenant with you, even the sure Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of David,</hi> Isa. 55. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But it is said that some knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when the Door was Shut.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, But the Texts in which these Knockers are Mentioned, are to be referred unto the day of Judgment, and not to the coming of the Sinner to Christ in this Life. (See the Texts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 11. <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 24, 25.)</p>
               <p>These therefore concern thee nothing at all; that art coming to Jesus Christ, thou art coming <hi>
                     <hi>Now!</hi> Now is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable time, behold now is the day of Salvation,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 2. now God is
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:47254:33"/>
upon the Mercy-Seat, now Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Sits by continually pleading the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his Blood for Sinners: and now, even as long as this World lasts, this word of the Text shall still be free, and fully fulfilled. <hi>And him that cometh to Me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sinner! the greater Sinner thou art, the greater need of Mercy thou hast, and the more will Christ be gloryfied thereby: come then, come and try, come tast, and see how good the Lord is to an Undeserving Worthless Sinner.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>But (sayes another) I am fallen since I began to come to Christ, therefore I fear I did not come aright, and so - conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that Christ will not receive me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Falls are dangerous, for they dishonour Christ, wound the conscience, and cause the Enemies of God to speak reproachfully. But it is no good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>I am fallen, therefore I was not coming aright to Jesus Christ.</hi> If <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> had thus objected against themselves, they had added to their griefs, and yet they had at least, as much cause to do it, as thou.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:47254:33"/>
A Man whose steps are ordered by the Lord, and whose goings the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in, may yet be over-taken with a Temptation, that may cause him to fall, <hi>Psal.</hi> 37. 23, 24. Did not <hi>Aaron</hi> fall, yea <hi>Moses</hi> himself? what shall we say of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Jehosaphat?</hi> There are therefore <hi>falls,</hi> and <hi>falls;</hi> falls par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable, and falls unpardonable; falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable are falls against Light, from the Faith to the despising of, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling upon Jesus Christ, and his blessed undertakings, (<hi>Heb.</hi>

                  </gap>. 2, 3, 4, 5. Chap. 10. 28, 29.) Now as for such, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines no more Sacrifice for sin: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they have no heart, no mind, no desire to come to Jesus Christ for life, therefore they must perish; nay, sayes the Holy Ghost, 'tis impossible that they should be renewed again unto repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Therefore, <hi>these</hi> God hath no Compassion for, neither ought we; but for other falls, though they be dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full (and God will Chastise his people for them) they do not prove thee a grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less man, one not Coming to Jesus Christ for life.</p>
               <p>It is said of the Child in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, <hi>That while he was yet a-coming, the Devil threw him down, and tore him,</hi> Luk. 9. 42.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:47254:34"/>Dejected Sinner, is it a wonder that thou hast caught a fall in thy Coming to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ! Is it not rather to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at, that thou hast not caught be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this, a thousand times a thousand falls! Considering,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> What fools we are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> What weaknesses are in us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What mighty powers, the fallen Angels, our implacable Enemies, are.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Considering also how often the Coming-man is be-nighted in his Journey, and also what stumbling-blocks do lie in his way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Also his familiers (that were so before) now watch for his haulting, and seek by what means they may, to cause him to fall by the hand of their strong ones.</p>
               <p>What then? must we, because of these Temptations, incline to fall? No. Must we not fear falls? yes. <hi>Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he fall.</hi> Yet let him not be utterly cast down. <hi>The Lord upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that are bowed down.</hi> Make not light of falls: yet hast thou
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47254:34"/>
fallen? <hi>ye have,</hi> said Samuel, <hi>done all this wickedness, yet turn not aside from following the Lord, but serve him with a perfect heart, and turn not aside, for the Lord will not forsake his people</hi> (and he counteth the coming sinner one of them) <hi>because it hath pleased the Lord to make you his people,</hi> 1 Sam. 12. 20, 21, 22.</p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Shall come to me.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>Now we come to shew, what force there is in this Promise to make them come to him. <hi>All that the father giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth me shall come to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will Speak to this promise,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First.</hi> In general.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> In particular.</p>
               <p>In general. This word [<hi>shall</hi>] is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to these [all] that are given to Christ. <hi>
                     <hi>All</hi> that the father giveth me,</hi> shall <hi>come to me.</hi> Hence I conclude,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That coming to Jesus Christ aright, is an effect of their being (of God) given to <hi>Christ</hi> before. Mark, <hi>they</hi> shall come! Who? <hi>those</hi> that are given; they <hi>come</hi> then, because they <hi>were given. Thine they were, and thou gavest them me.</hi> Now this is indeed a Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar comfort to them that are coming
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47254:35"/>
in truth to Christ. Thus then may the coming Soul reason with himself as he comes. Am I coming indeed to Jesus Christ? this coming of mine is not to be attributed to me, or my goodness, but to the grace and gift of God to Christ: God gave first my Person to him, and therefore hath now given me a heart to come to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This word, <hi>shall come,</hi> mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thy coming, not only the fruit of the gift of the Father, but also of the purpose of the Son; for these words are a divine purpose, they shew us the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly determination of the Son. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath given them to me, and they shall, yea, they shall come to me. Christ is as full in his resolution to save those given to him, as is the Father in the giving of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> These words, <hi>shall come,</hi> make thy coming to be also the effect of an absolute Promise. Coming sinner, thou art concluded in a Promise; thy coming is the fruit of the faithfulness of the Promise, of the faithfulness of an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Promise. 'Twas this promise, by the vertue of which thou at first recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved'st strength to come: And this is the Promise, by the vertue of which thou
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:47254:35"/>
shalt be effectually brought to him. It was said to Abraham, <hi>At this time, will I come, and</hi> Sarah <hi>shall have a Son:</hi> this Son was <hi>Isaac.</hi> Mark, Sarah <hi>shall have a Son;</hi> There is the promise: and <hi>Sarah</hi> had a Son, there was the fullfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the promise. And therefore was <hi>Isaac</hi> called the child of the promise, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 19. Chap. 18. 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sarah</hi> shall have a Son, but how if <hi>Sarah</hi> be past age? why still the promise continues, to say, Sarah <hi>shall have a Son.</hi> But <hi>Abrahams</hi> body is now dead; why, the promise is still the same; Sarah <hi>shall have a Son.</hi> Thus you see what vertue there is in an absolute promise. It carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth enough in its own bowels to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish the thing promised, whether there be means or no in us to effect it: wherefore this promise, in the Text, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an absolute promise; by vertue of it, not by vertue of our selves, or our own enducements, do we come to Jesus Christ: for so are the words of the Text. <hi>All that the Father giveth me</hi> shall <hi>come to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore is every sincere commer to Jesus Christ, called also a Child of the promise. <hi>Now we brethren, as</hi> Isaac <hi>was, are the Children of the promise,</hi> Sal. 4.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:47254:36"/>
28. That is, we are the Children that God hath promised to Jesus Christ, and given to him; yea, the Children that Jesus Christ hath promised shall come to him. <hi>All that the Father giveth me, shall come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This word [<hi>shall-come</hi>] en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gageth Christ to Communicate all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Grace to those thus given him, to make them effectually to come to him. <hi>They shall come;</hi> that is, not if they will, but if grace, all grace, if pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, wisdom, a new heart and the holy spirit, and all Joyning together, can make them come. I say, this word [<hi>shall-come</hi>] being absolute, hath no dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our will, or power, or goodness; but it ingageth for us even God himself, Christ himself, the Spirit himself. When God had made that Absolute promise to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>Sarah should have a Son,</hi> Abraham did not at all look at any qualification in himself, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the promise looked at none, but as God had by the promise absolutely promised him a Son; so he considered not his own body now dead, nor yet the barrenness of <hi>Sarah's</hi> Womb. <hi>He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:47254:36"/>
                  <hi>glory to God, being fully perswaded that what <hi>He</hi> had promised,</hi> He <hi>was able to perform,</hi> Rom. 4. He had promised, and had promised absolutely, <hi>Sarah shall have a Son.</hi> Therefore <hi>Abraham</hi> looks that <hi>He,</hi> to wit, God must fulfill the condition of it. Neither is this Expectation of <hi>Abraham,</hi> disapproved by the Holy Ghost, but accounted good and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, it being that by which he gave Glory to God. The Father also hath given to Christ, a certain number of Souls for him to save, and he himself hath said, <hi>They shall come to him.</hi> Let the Church of God then live in a Joyful Expectation of the utmost accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of this promise, for assuredly it shall be fulfilled, and not one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandth part of a Tittle thereof shall fail.</p>
               <p>And now, before I go any further, I will more particularly enquire into the nature of an <hi>Absolute Promise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> We call that an Absolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, that is made without any conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; or more fully thus. That is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute promise of God, or of Christ, which maketh over to this or that man, any Saving Spiritual blessing, without a condition to be done on our part for
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:47254:37"/>
the obtaining thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> An Absolute promise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is, as we say, without if, or and; that is, it requireth nothing of us, that it self might be accomplisht. It saith not, They shall <hi>if they will;</hi> but <hi>they shall:</hi> not they shall, if they use the means; but <hi>they shall.</hi> You may say, that a will, and the use of the means, is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, though not expressed. But I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer; No, by no means; that is, as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this promise: If they be at all included in the promise, they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded there as the fruit of the Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute promise, not as if it expected the qualification to arise from us. <hi>Thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple shall be willing in the day of thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Psal. 110. 3. That is another absolute promise: But doth that Promise suppose a willingness in us, as a condition of Gods making of us willing? they shall be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if they <hi>are</hi> willing; or they shall be willing, if they <hi>will</hi> be willing. This is ridiculous, there is nothing of this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. The promise is absolute, as to us; all that it ingageth for its one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment, is the mighty power of Christ.</p>
               <p>The difference therefore betwixt the absolute, and the conditional promise, is this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:47254:37"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> They differ in their <hi>terms.</hi> The absolute promises say, <hi>I will,</hi> and you shall: the other, <hi>I will, if you will;</hi> or do this, and thou shalt live; <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 31, 32, 33. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 30, 31, 32. <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> They differ in their way of Communicating of good things to men; the absolute ones Communicate things freely, only of Grace; the other, if there be that qualification in us, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise calls for, not else.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The absolute promises there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ingage God, the other ingage us: I mean God only, us only.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Absolute promises must be fulfilled; Conditional may, or may not be fulfilled. The absolute ones must be fulfilled, because of the faithfulness of God; the other may not, because of the unfaithfulness of men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Absolute promises have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a sufficiency in themselves to bring about their own fulfilling; the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal have not so. The absolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, is therefore a big-bellied promise, because it hath in it self a fulness of all desired things for us; and will, when
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:47254:38"/>
the time of that promise is come, yeild to us mortals, that which will very<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly save us: yea, and make us capable of answering of the demands, of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise that is conditional. Wherefore, though there be a real, yea an eternal difference in these things (with others) betwixt the conditional and absolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise: yet again in other respects there is a blessed Harmony betwixt them, as may be seen in these particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The Conditional promise calls for Repentance, and the absolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise gives it, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 30, 31.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Conditional promise <hi>calls</hi> for <hi>faith,</hi> the absolute promise <hi>gives it,</hi> Zeph 3. 12. Rom. 15. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Conditional promise <hi>calls</hi> for a <hi>new heart,</hi> the absolute promise <hi>gives it,</hi> Ezek. 36.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Conditional promise <hi>calleth</hi> for <hi>Holy Obedience,</hi> the absolute promise giveth, or causeth it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 27.</p>
               <p>And as they Harmoniously agree in this; so again the Conditional promise blesseth the man, who by the absolute promise is endued with its fruit: As for instance,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The absolute promise maketh
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:47254:38"/>
men upright, and then the Conditional follows saying, <hi>Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the Law of the Lord,</hi> Psal. 119. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The absolute promise giveth to this man, the fear of the Lord; and then the Conditional followeth saying, Blessed is every <hi>one that feareth the Lord,</hi> Psal. 128. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The absolute promise giveth saith, and then this Conditional follows saying, <hi>Blessed is she that believeth,</hi> Zeph. 3. 12. Luk. 1. 45.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Absolute promise brings free forgiveness of Sins; and then says the Conditional, <hi>Blessed are they, whose Transgressions are forgiven, and whose sin is covered,</hi> Rom. 4. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The Absolute promise says, that Gods elect shall hold out to the end; then the Conditional follows with his blessing, <hi>He that shall endure to the end, the same shall be saved,</hi> 1 Pet 1. 4, 5, 6. Mat. 24.</p>
               <p>Thus do the promises gloriously serve one another, <hi>and us,</hi> in this their har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious agreement.</p>
               <p>Now the promise under consideration, is an absolute promise; <hi>All that the Father giveth me,</hi> shall <hi>come to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:47254:39"/>This promise therefore is a big-bellied promise, and hath in it self all those things to bestow upon us, that the conditional calleth for at our hands. <hi>They shall come!</hi> Shall they come? yes, <hi>They shall come.</hi> But how if they want those things, those Graces, Power and Heart, without which they cannot come? Why, <hi>
                     <hi>Shall</hi> come</hi> answereth all this, and all things else that may in this manner be objected. And here I will take the liberty a little to amplifie things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But they are dead, dead in Trespasses and Sins, how shall they then come?</p>
               <p>Answ. Why? <hi>Shall-come, can raise them from this Death. The hour is coming, and now is, That the dead shall hear the Voice of the Son of God, and they that hear, shall Live.</hi> Thus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is this impediment, by <hi>shall-come,</hi> swallowed up, or quite removed out of the way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object. 2.</hi> But they are Satans Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, he takes them Captive at his Will, and he is stronger than they; How then can they come?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Why? <hi>Shall-come,</hi> hath also provided an help for this. Satan had bound that Daughter of <hi>Abraham</hi> so, that she could by no means lift up her
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:47254:39"/>
self; but yet, <hi>shall-come,</hi> set her free in Body and Soul both. Christ will have them turned from the <hi>Power</hi> of Satan to God. But what! Must it be, if they turn themselves, or do something to Merit of him to turn them! No, he will do it freely of his own good Will. Alas! Man whose Soul is possessed by the Devil, is turned whither soever That Governor listeth; is taken Captive by him, notwithstanding his natural Powers, at his Will; but what will he do? will he hold him, when <hi>shall-come</hi> puts forth it self (will he then let him) for come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Jesus Christ? No: that cannot be, his Power is but the Power of a fallen Angel; but <hi>shall-come,</hi> is the Word of God: therefore <hi>shall-come</hi> must be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, <hi>And the Gates</hi> of Hell <hi>Shall</hi> not prevail against it.</p>
               <p>There was Seven Devils in <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> too many for her to get from under the Power of; but when the time was come, that <hi>shall-come</hi> was to be fulfilled upon her, they give place, fly from her, and she comes [indeed] to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ. <hi>All that the Father giveth me shall come to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Man that was possessed with a <hi>Legien</hi> (Mark 5.) was too much, by
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:47254:40"/>
them, captivated, for him by humane force; yea, had he had (to boot) all the men under Heaven to help him, had he that said, he <hi>shall-come,</hi> with-held his mighty power: but when this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise was to be fulfilled upon him, then he comes, nor could all their power hinder his coming. It was also this <hi>shall-come,</hi> that preserved him from death, when by these evil spirits he was hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hither and thither; and 'twas by the vertue of <hi>shall-come,</hi> that at last he was set at liberty from them, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled indeed to <hi>come</hi> to Christ. <hi>All that the father giveth me shall come to me.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Object. 3.</hi> They shall (you say) but how if they will not! man cannot come without his will: but if he will not, he will not; and if so, then what can <hi>shall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,</hi> do?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> True there are some men say, <hi>we are Lords, we will come no more unto thee,</hi> Jer. 2. 31. But as God says in another case (if they are Concerned in shall-come to me) <hi>They shall know whose word shall stand, mine or theirs,</hi> Jer. 44. 28. Here then is the case, we must now see who will be the liar, he that saith, <hi>I will not,</hi> or he that saith, <hi>he shall come</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:47254:40"/>
                  <hi>to me.</hi> You <hi>shall come,</hi> sayes God. <hi>I will not come</hi> sayes the sinner. Now as sure as he is concerned in this <hi>shall-come,</hi> God will make that man eat his own words: for <hi>I will not,</hi> is but the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advised Conclusion of a Crazy-headed sinner: but <hi>shall-come,</hi> was spoken by him that is of power to perform his word. <hi>Son, go work to day in my vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard,</hi> said the Father: but he answered and said, <hi>I will not.</hi> What now? Will he be able to stand to his refusal, will he pursue his desperate denial! No: He <hi>afterwards repented, and went.</hi> But how came he by that repentance? Why it was wrapped up, for him, in the <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute</hi> promise; and therefore not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he said, <hi>I will not,</hi> he afterwards repented and went. By this parable, Jesus Christ sets forth the obstinacy of the sinners of the world, as touching their coming to him; they will not <hi>come,</hi> though threatned, yea though life be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them upon condition of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>But now when, <hi>shall-come,</hi> the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute promise of God, <hi>comes</hi> to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled upon them, then they come; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by <hi>that</hi> promise is provided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the rebellion of their will; <hi>Thy</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:47254:41"/>
                  <hi>people shall be willing in the day of thy power,</hi> Psal. 110. 3.</p>
               <p>He that had seen <hi>Paul</hi> in the midst of his out-rage against Christ, his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and people: would hardly have thought that he would ever have been a follower of Jesus Christ, specially since he went not against his Conscience in his persecuting of them. He thought verily that he ought to do what he did. But we may see, what <hi>shall-come</hi> can do, when it comes to be fulfilled upon the Soul of a rebellious sinner he was a Chosen vessel, given by the Father to the Son; and now the time being come, that <hi>shall-come,</hi> was to take him in hand, behold he is over-mastered, astonished, and with trembling, and reverence, in a Moment becomes <hi>willing</hi> to be obedient to the Heavenly call, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>And were not they far gone (that you read of in <hi>Acts</hi> the second) who had their hands and hearts in the Murder of the Son of God; and to shew their resolvedness never to repent of that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid fact, said, <hi>His Blood be on us and our Children?</hi> But must their obstinacy rule, must they be bound to their own ruin by the rebellion of their Stubborn wills? No: not <hi>those</hi> of <hi>these</hi> that the Father
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:47254:41"/>
gave to Christ, wherefore at the times appointed, <hi>shall-come</hi> Brakes in among<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>them; the absolute promise takes them in hand, and then they <hi>come</hi> indeed, crying out to <hi>Peter,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do?</hi> No Stubborness of mans will can stand, when God hath absolutely said the contrary, <hi>shall-come,</hi> can make them come as doves to their windows.</p>
               <p>The Lord spake unto <hi>Manasseth,</hi> and to his people (by the Prophets) but he would not hear, no, he <hi>would not:</hi> but shall <hi>Manasseth</hi> come off thus? no, he <hi>shall not.</hi> Therefore, he being also one of those whom the Father had given to the Son, and so falling within the bounds and reach of shall-come: At last he comes indeed. He comes Bowing, and Bending; He humbled himself greatly, and made Supplication to the Lord, and prayed unto him, and he was intreated of him, and had mercy upon him, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 33.</p>
               <p>The Thief upon the Cross, at first, did rail, with his fellow, upon Jesus Christ; but he was one that the Father had given to him, and therefore <hi>shall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,</hi> must handle him, and his rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous will. And behold, so soon as he
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47254:42"/>
is dealt with all, by vertue of that abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute promise, how soon he buckleth, leaves his railing, falls to Supplicating of the Son of God for mercy; <hi>Lord,</hi> saith he, <hi>remember me, when thou comest into thy Kingdome,</hi> Mat. 27. 44. Luk. 23. 40, 41, 42.</p>

                  <hi>Object. 4.</hi> They shall come, <hi>say you,</hi> but how if they be blind, and see not the way; for same are kept off from Christ, not only by the obstinacy of their will, but by the blindness of their minde: now if they be blind, how shall they come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> The question is not, Are they blind? but, are they with in the reach, and power of <hi>shall come;</hi> if so, <hi>That</hi> Christ, that said they <hi>shall-come,</hi> will find them eyes, or a guide, or both, to bring them to himself. If they <hi>shall-come,</hi> they <hi>shall-come:</hi> no impediment shall hinder.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Thessalonians</hi> darkness did not hinder them from being the Children of Light: <hi>I am come,</hi> said Christ <hi>that they that see not, might see.</hi> And if he saith, <hi>See ye blind, that have eyes,</hi> who shall hinder it? <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 8. Joh. 9. 39. Isa. 29. 18. Chap. 43. 8.</p>
               <p>This promise therefore, is, as I said, abig-bellied promise, having in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of it, all things that shall accur to
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47254:42"/>
the compleat fulfilling of it self. They <hi>shall-come.</hi> But 'tis objected that they are blind: well, <hi>shall-come,</hi> is still the same, and continueth to say, they <hi>shall-come to me.</hi> Therefore he saith again, <hi>I will bring the blind by a way that they know not, I will lead them in paths that they have not known. I will make darkness light before them, and Crooked things straight, these things will I do unto them, and not forsake them,</hi> Isa. 42. 16.</p>
               <p>Mark, I will bring them though they be blind, I will bring them by a way they know not; I will, I will, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>they shall-come to me.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> What then? Shall that hinder the execution of <hi>shall-come?</hi> It is not Transgressions, nor Sins, nor all their Transgressions, in all their sins (if they by the Father are given to Christ to save them) that shall hinder this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, that it should not be fulfilled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. <hi>In those days, and at that time, saith the Lord, the iniquities of</hi> Israel <hi>shall be fought for, and there shall be</hi>

And it <hi>shall</hi> be to me for a name of joy, a praise, and an honour before all the Nations of the Earth, which shall hear of all the good that I do unto them; and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness, and all the prosperity that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to it,</hi> Jer. 33. 8, 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object 6.</hi> But how if they have not Faith and Repentance? how shall they come then?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Why? he that saith they <hi>shall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,</hi> shall he not make it good? If they <hi>shall-come,</hi> they <hi>shall</hi>-come; and he that hath said, they <hi>shall-come,</hi> if faith and repentance be the <hi>way</hi> to come, as indeed they are, then faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance shall be given to them: for <hi>shall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,</hi> must be fulfilled on them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Faith <hi>shall</hi> be given them; <hi>I</hi>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:47254:43"/>
                  <hi>will also leave in the midst of thee an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and poor people, and they</hi> shall <hi>trust in the name of the Lord. There</hi> shall <hi>be a Root of</hi> Jesse, <hi>and he <hi>shall</hi> rise to raign over the Gentiles; and in him</hi> shall <hi>the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles trust,</hi> Zeph. 3. 12. Rom. 15. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> They <hi>shall</hi> have repentance: He is exalted to give repentance; <hi>They <hi>shall</hi> come weeping and seeking the Lord their God. And again, with Weeping and Supplication will I lead them,</hi> Acts 5. 30, 31. Jer. 31. 9. Chap. 50. 5.</p>
               <p>I told you before, that an absolute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, hath all <hi>conditional</hi> ones in the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of it, and also provision to answer all those qualifications that <hi>they</hi> propound to him that seeketh for <hi>their</hi> benefit: And it must be so, for if <hi>shall-come</hi> be an absolute promise, as indeed it is, then it must be fulfilled upon every of those. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned therein. I say, it must be fulfilled, if God can by Grace, &amp; his absolute Will, fulfil it. Besides, since Coming, and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving is all one (according to <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 35.) <hi>He that cometh to me shall never hunger, and he that believeth in me shall never thirst.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then, when he saith, they <hi>shall come,</hi> 'tis as much as to say, they <hi>shall believe,</hi> and consequently repent to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Soul. So then the present
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:47254:44"/>
want of faith and repentance, cannot make this promise of God of none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; because that this promise hath in it to give, what others call for and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. I will give them an heart, I will give them my spirit, I will give them repentance, I will give them faith. Mark these words, <hi>If any man be in Christ, he is a new Creature.</hi> But how came he to be a new Creature, since none can Create but God? why, God indeed doth make them new Creatures. <hi>Behold,</hi> saith <hi>he, I make all things new.</hi> And hence it follows, even after he had said, they are new Creatures; <hi>And all things are of God:</hi> that is, all this new Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation standeth in the several ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and special workings of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace, who is God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17, 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object. 7.</hi> But how shall they escape all those dangerous, and damnable opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that like rocks, and quick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sands, are in the way in which they are going?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Indeed this age, is an age of errors, if ever there was an age of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in the world; but yet the gift of the Father, laid claim to by the Son in the Text, must needs escape them, and in conclusion come to him. There are
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:47254:44"/>
a company of <hi>shall-comes</hi> in the Bible, that doth secure them. Not but that they may be assaulted by them; yea, and also for the time, intangled and detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them from the Bishop of their Souls: but these <hi>Shall-comes,</hi> will break those Chains and Fetters, that those given to Christ are intangled in, and they <hi>shall-come,</hi> because he hath said they shall-come to him.</p>
               <p>Indeed, errors are like that whore, of whom you read in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> that sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in her seat on the High-places of the City, <hi>To call Passingers who go right on their way,</hi> (Pro. 9. 13, 14, 15, 16.) But the persons, as I said, that by the Father are given to the Son to save them, are at one time or other, secured by, <hi>Shall-come to me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore, of such it is said; God will guide them with his eye, with his counsels, by his spirit, and that in the way of peace; by the springs of water, and into all truth, <hi>Psal.</hi> 32. 8. <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. 24. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 13. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 79. <hi>Isa.</hi> 47. 10. So then, he that hath <hi>such</hi> a guide (and all that the Father giveth to Christ, shall have it) he shall escape those dangers, he shall not Err in the way; yea, though he be a fool, he <hi>shall</hi> not Err therein
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47254:45"/>
(<hi>Isa</hi> 35.) for of every such an one it is said, <hi>Thine cars shall hear a word behind thee, saying; This is the way, walk in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left,</hi> Isa 30. 21.</p>
               <p>There were Thieves and Robbers before Christs coming, as there are also now: But, saith he, <hi>The sheep did not hear them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And why did they not hear them, but because they were under the power of <hi>shall come:</hi> that absolute promise, that had that grace in it self to bestow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, as could make them able right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to distinguish of voices. <hi>My sheep hear my voice.</hi> But how came they to hear it? why, to them it is given to know and to hear, and that distinguishingly, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 8, 16. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 25. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 14.</p>
               <p>Further, the very plain Sentence of the Text makes provision against all these things; for, saith it, <hi>All that the Father giveth me, shall come to <hi>me;</hi>
                  </hi> that is, shall not be stopped, or be allured to take up any where short of <hi>Me;</hi> nor shall they turn aside, to abide, with any besides <hi>Me.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Shall Come [to me.]</q>
               <p>
                  <hi>To me!</hi>] By these words there is further insinuated (though not expressed) a double cause of their coming to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:47254:45"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> There is in Christ, a fulness of Al-sufficiency of <hi>that,</hi> even of all <hi>that</hi> which is needfull to make us happy.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Those that indeed come to him, do therefore come to him that they may receive it at his hand.</p>
               <p>For the first of these, <hi>There is in Christ a fulness of all Sufficiency of all that, even of all that which is needfull to make us happy.</hi> Hence it is said, <hi>For it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Father, that in him should all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness dwell.</hi> And again, <hi>Of his fullness, all we have received, and grace for grace,</hi> Colos. 1. 19. Joh. 1. 16. It is also said of him, that his riches is unsearchable, <hi>The unsearchable riches of Christ,</hi> Ephes. 3. 8. Hear what he saith of himself, <hi>Riches and honour are with <hi>Me,</hi> even du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable riches and righteousness; my fruit is better than Gold, yea than sine Gold; and <hi>My</hi> revenue than Choice silver: I lead in the way of Righteousness, in the midst of the paths of Judgement, that I may cause them that love <hi>Me</hi> to inherit Substance. And I will fill their treasures,</hi> Prov. 8. 18. 19, 20. 21.</p>
               <p>This in general, but more particularly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> There is that <hi>Light</hi> in Christ, that is Sufficient to lead them out of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and from all that darkness, in the midst

of which all others, but them that come to him, stumble, and fall, and perish: <hi>I am the light of the world,</hi> saith he; <hi>he that followeth <hi>me</hi> shall not abide in darkness, but shall have the Light of Life,</hi> Joh. 8. 12. Man by nature is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knows not whither he goes, for darkness hath blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded his eyes; neither can any thing but Jesus Christ, lead men out of this dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; Natural Conscience cannot do it; the Ten Commandments, though in the heart of man, cannot do it: this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative belongs only to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> There is that life in Christ, that is to be found no where else, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 40. Life as a principle in the Soul, by which it shall be acted and enabled to do that which through him is pleasing to God. <hi>He that believeth</hi> in, or cometh, <hi>to <hi>me,</hi>
                  </hi> saith he, as the Scriptures have said, <hi>out of his belly shall flow Rivers of Living Water,</hi> Joh. 7. 38. Without this life a man is dead, whether he be bad, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be good, that is good in his own, and other mens esteem. There is no true and Eternal life, but what is in the <hi>Me</hi> that speaketh in the Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:47254:46"/>There is also life for those, that come to him, to be had by faith in his flesh, and blood. <hi>He that eateth Me, even he shall live by Me,</hi> Joh. 6. 57.</p>
               <p>And this is a life against that Death, that comes by the guilt of sin, and the curse of the Law, under which all men are, and forever must be, unlesse they eat the <hi>Me,</hi> that speaks in the Text. <hi>Whoso findeth <hi>Me,</hi>
                  </hi> saith he, <hi>findeth life;</hi> deliverance from that everlasting death, and destruction, that without <hi>Me</hi> he shall be devoured by, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Nothing is more desirable than life, to him that hath in himself the Sentence of Condemnation; and here only is life to be found. <hi>This life,</hi> to wit, Eternal life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>this life is in his Son.</hi> That is, in him that saith in the Text, <hi>All that the Father hath given <hi>Me</hi> shall come to <hi>Me,</hi>
                  </hi> 1 Joh. 5. 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The person speaking in the Text, is he alone by whom poor sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have Admittance with, and Acceptance to the Father, because of the Glory of his righteousness, by and in which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth them amiable, and spotless in his sight; neither is there any way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides him, so to come to the Father; <hi>I am the way,</hi> sayes he, <hi>the truth, and the life;</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:47254:47"/>
                  <hi>no man cometh to the Father but by <hi>Me,</hi>
                  </hi> Joh. 14. 6. All other ways to God, are dead and damnable, the destroying Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bins, stand with flaming swords turning every way to keep all others from his presence, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 24.) I say, all others but them that come by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am the door, by <hi>Me,</hi>
                  </hi> saith he, <hi>if any man enter in, he shall be saued,</hi> Joh. 10. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>The person speaking in the Text, is He, and only He, that can give stable, and everlasting peace; therefore, saith he, <hi>
                     <hi>My</hi> peace I give unto you. <hi>My</hi>
                  </hi> peace, which is a peace with God, peace of Conscience, and that of an everlasting du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. My peace, peace that cannot be Matched, <hi>net as the world gived give I unto you;</hi> for the worlds peace is but Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and Transitory; but mine is Divine and Eternal. Hence it is called, the peace of God, and <hi>That</hi> passeth all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The person speaking in the Text, hath enough of all things truly Spiritually good, to satisfie the desires of every longing Soul. <hi>And Jesus stood, and Cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.</hi> And to him that is athirst, I will give of the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:47254:47"/>
of the water of life freely, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 37. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> With the person speaking in the Text, is power to perfect and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, and deliver those that come to him for safegard. <hi>All power,</hi> saith he, <hi>in heaven, and earth, is given unto <hi>Me,</hi>
                  </hi> Mat. 28. 18.</p>
               <p>Thus might I multiply instances of this nature in abundance. But</p>
               <p>Secondly, they that in truth, do come to him, do therefore come to him, that they may receive it at his hand. They come for light, they come for life, they come for reconciliation with God; they also come for peace, they come that their Soul may be satisfied with Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al good, and that they may be protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him against all Spiritual and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal damnation; and he alone is able to give them all this, to the filling of their joy to the full, as they also find, when come to him.</p>
               <p>This is evident,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> From the plain declaration of those that already are come to him. <hi>Being Justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom also we have access with boldness in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this grace, wherein we stand, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:47254:48"/>
                  <hi>in hope of the glory of God,</hi> Rom. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'Tis evident also, in that while they keep their eyes upon him, they never desire to change him for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, or to add to themselves, some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, together with him to make up their Spiritual Joy. <hi>God forbid,</hi> said <hi>Paul, that I should Glory, save in the Cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> Yea and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things; and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ, and be found in him; not having mine own Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which is of the Law, but that which is thorough the faith of Christ, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness which is of God by faith, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lipians</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> 'Tis evident also by their ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest desires, that others might be made partakers of their blessedness. Brethren, said <hi>Paul,</hi> my hearts desire and prayer to God for <hi>Israel</hi> is, that they might be saved, that is, that way that he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be saved himself, as he saith also to the <hi>Galatians. Brethren,</hi> saith he, <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, be as I am, for I am as ye are.</hi> That is, I am a sinner as you are; now
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:47254:48"/>
I beseech you seek for life, as I am seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it: as who should say, For there is a sufficiency in the Lord Jesus both for me and you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> 'Tis evident also, by the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph that such men make over all their enemies, both Bodily, and Ghostly: <hi>Now, thanks be to God,</hi> said <hi>Paul, who causeth us always to triumph in Jesus</hi> Christ. And who shall separate us from the Love of Christ our Lord. And again, <hi>O death where is thy sting! O Grave, where is thy victory! The sting of death is Sin, and the strength of sin, is the Law; but thanks be to God, who giveth us the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thorow our Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 14. Rom. 8. 35. 1 Cor. 15. 55, 56.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> 'Tis evident also, for that they are made, by the Glory of that which they have found in him, to suffer, and endure what the Devil and Hell it self hath or could invent, as a means to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate them from him. Again, <hi>Who shall separate us from the Love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or Sword (as it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long, we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter)? Nay, in all these things we are more than Conquerors, through him</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:47254:49"/>
                  <hi>that loved us. For I am perswaded, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther death, nor life, nor Angels, nor prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other Creature shall be able to separate us from the Love of God, which is in Christ Jesus,</hi> Rom 8.</p>
               <p>Shall come [to Me.] O the heart at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting glory that is in Jesus Christ, (when he is discovered) to draw those to him that are given to him of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Therefore, those that come of old rendered this, as the cause of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him. <hi>And we beheld his glory, as of the only begotten of the Father,</hi> Joh. 1. 14. And the reason why others come not, but perish in their sins, is for want of a sight of his glory. <hi>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world hath blinded the minds of them that believe not, lest the Glorious Light of the Gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 3. 4.</p>
               <p>There is therefore heart-pulling glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Jesus Christ, which, when discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, draws the man to him; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by, <hi>shall-come to <hi>Me,</hi>
                  </hi> Christ may mean; when his glory is discovered, then they must come, then they <hi>shall-come</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:47254:49"/>
                  <hi>to <hi>Me.</hi>
                  </hi> Therefore, as the True Comers come with Weeping and Relenting, as being sensible of their own Vileness; so again it is said, <hi>That the Ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to</hi> Zion, <hi>with Singing and Everlasting Joy upon their Heads; they shall obtain Joy and Gladness, and Sorrow and Sighing shall flye away:</hi> That is, at the Sight of the Glory of that Grace, that shews it self to them <hi>now,</hi> in the Face of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Hopes that they <hi>now</hi> have of being with Him in the Heavenly Tabernacles. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it saith again; <hi>With Gladness and Rejoycing shall they be brought; they shall enter into the King</hi>'s <hi>Palace,</hi> Isa. 35. 10. <hi>Chap.</hi> 51. 11. Psal. 45. 15.</p>
               <p>There is therefore Heart-attracting Glory in the Lord Jesus Christ; which, when discovered, subjects the Heart to the Word, and <hi>Makes</hi> us Come to him.</p>
               <p>'Tis said of <hi>Abraham, That when he dwelt in</hi> Mesopotamia, <hi>the God of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry appeared unto him,</hi> (Act. 7. 2.) <hi>say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Get thee out of thy Country.</hi> And what then? why, away he went from his House and Friends, and all the World could not stay him. <hi>Now,</hi> as the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:47254:50"/>
sayes, <hi>Who is the King of Glory?</hi> He answers. The Lord mighty in Battle: And who was that, but He that spoiled Principalities and Powers, when he did Hang upon the Tree, Tryumphing over them thereon? And who was that, but Jesus Christ, even the Person speaking in the Text? Therefore, he said of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, He saw his Day;</hi> Yea, saith he to the <hi>Jews, Your Father</hi> Abraham <hi>rejoiced to see my Day; and he saw it, and was Glad,</hi> Psal. 24. 8. Col. 2. 14, 15. Jam. 1. 1. Joh. 8. 56.</p>
               <p>Indeed, the Carnal Man sayes (at least) in his Heart, There is no Form or Comliness in Christ; and when he shall see him, there is no Beauty that he should desire him; <hi>But he lies:</hi> This he speaks, as having never seen him. But they that stand in his House, and looks upon him through the Glass of his Word, by the Help of his Holy Spirit, they will tell you other things. <hi>But we,</hi> say they, <hi>all with open Face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding, as in a Glass, the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the same Image, from Glory to Glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 17, 18. They see Glory in his Person, Glory in his Undertakings, Glory in the Merit of his Blood, and Glory in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:47254:50"/>
of his Righteousness; yea, Heart-affecting, Heart-changing Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry!</p>
               <p>Indeed, his Glory is veiled, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be seen, but as discovered by the Father (<hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 27.) It is veiled with Flesh, with Meanness of Descent from the Flesh, and with that Ignomy and Shame that attended him in the Flesh; but they that can, in God's Light, see through these things, they shall see Glory in him; yea, such Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as will draw, and pull their Hearts unto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> was the Adopted Son of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roah</hi>'s Daughter; and, for ought I know, had bin King at last, had he now conformed to the present Vanities that was there at Court; but he could not, he would not do it: Why? what was the matter? Why? he saw more in the worst of Christ, (bear with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression) than he saw in the best of all the Treasures of the Land of <hi>Egypt. He refused to be called the Son of</hi> Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh's <hi>Daughter; choosing rather to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the Pleasures of Sin for a Season: Esteeming the Reproach of Christ greater Riches, than the Treasures in</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:47254:51"/>
                  <hi>for he had respect to the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Reward. He forsook</hi> Egypt, <hi>not fearing the Wrath of the King: But what emboldened him thus to do?</hi> Why? he endured; for he had a Sight of the Person speaking in the Text: <hi>He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, as seeing Him who is Invisible.</hi> But, I say, would a Sight of Jesus have thus taken away <hi>Moses</hi>'s Heart from a Crown, and a Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had he not by that Sight seen more in Him, than was to be seen in them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 24, 25, 26.</p>
               <p>Therefore, when he saith, <hi>Shall come to Me,</hi> he means, They shall have a Discovery of the Glory of the Grace that is in Him; and the Beauty and Glory of <hi>that</hi> is of such Vertue, that it constraineth, and forceth, with a Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Violency, the Hearts of those that are given to Him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moses,</hi> of whom we spake before, was <hi>no Child,</hi> when he was thus taken with the Beauteous Glory of this Lord: He was <hi>Forty Years old,</hi> and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently was able, being a Man of that Wisdom and Opportunity as he was, to make the best Judgement of the Things, and of the Goodness of them that was before him in the Land of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:47254:51"/>
But he, even he it was, that set that low Esteem upon the Glory of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as to count it not worth the medling with, when he had a Sight of this Lord Jesus Christ. This wicked World thinks, that the Fancies of a Heaven, and a Happiness hereafter, may serve well enough to take the Heart of such, as either have not the Worlds good Things to delight in; or that are Fools, and know not how to delight themselves therein: But let them know again, that we have had Men of all Ranks and Qualities, that have been taken with the Glory of our Lord Jesus, and have left All to follow Him: As <hi>Abel, Seth, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac; Jacob, Moses, Samuel, David, Solomon;</hi> and who not, that had either Wit or Grace to savour Heavenly things? Indeed, none can stand off from Him, nor any longer out against Him, to whom he Reveals the Glory of his Grace.</p>
               <q>And him that cometh to Me, I will in no wise cast out.</q>
               <p>By these Words, our Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> doth set forth (yet more amply) the great
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47254:52"/>
Goodness of his Nature towards the Coming Sinner. Before he said, They <hi>Shall come;</hi> and here he declareth, <hi>That with Heart and Affections he will receive them.</hi> But by the way, let me speak one Word or two, to the Conditiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of this Promise, with which now I have to do. <hi>And him that cometh to Me, I will not cast out:</hi> Where it is evident (may some say), That <hi>Christ</hi>'s Receiving us to Mercy, depends upon our Coming; and so our Salvation by <hi>Christ</hi> is Conditional: If we Come, we shall be Received; if not, we shall not: for that is fully intimated by the Words. The Promise of Reception is only to him that Cometh: <hi>And him that cometh.</hi> I Answer; That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in these Words mentioned, as a Condition of being Received to Life, is, that which is promised, yea, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be effected in us by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise going before. In those latter Words, Coming to <hi>Christ</hi> is implicitly required of us; and in the Words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that Grace is positively promised to us. It is, as if he should say; All that the Father giveth Me, shall come to Heaven; and him that cometh to Heaven, I will in no wise cast out
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:47254:52"/>
thence. We come to <hi>Christ,</hi> because it is said, We <hi>Shall come;</hi> because it is given to us <hi>to Come:</hi> So that, the Condition which is expressed by <hi>Christ</hi> in these later Words, is absolutely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in the Words before. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the Coming here intended, is nothing else but the Effect of, <hi>Shall come to Me.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>And him that cometh.]</q>
               <p>To speak to these Words,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In general.</item>
                  <item>2. More particularly.</item>
               </list>
               <p>In general: They suggest unto us these four Things:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> doth build upon it; that since the Father <hi>gave</hi> his People to him, they shall be enabled to <hi>Come</hi> unto him. <hi>And him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth:</hi> As who should say; I know, that since they are <hi>Given</hi> to Me, they shall be enabled to <hi>Come</hi> unto Me. He saith not, <hi>
                     <hi>If</hi> they come,</hi> or <hi>I Suppose</hi> they will Come; but, <hi>And him that cometh.</hi> By these Words therefore he shews us, that he addresseth himself to the Receiving of them whom the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gave to him, to save them: By
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:47254:53"/>
which, as I said, he concludeth or build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon it, that they shall indeed Come to Him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, Christ</hi> also suggesteth by these Words, That he very well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth who are given to him; not by their Coming to him, but by their being Given to him. <hi>All that the Father giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Me, shall come to Me: And him that cometh,</hi> &amp;c. This <hi>Him</hi> he knoweth to be one of them, that the Father hath Given him; and therefore, he Receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him, even because the Father hath Given him to Him. <hi>I know my Sheep,</hi> saith he: Not only those, that already have Knowledge of him; but those too, that yet are ignorant of him. <hi>Other Sheep have I</hi> (said he) <hi>which are not of this Fold:</hi> Not of the <hi>Jewish - Church;</hi> but those that lie in their Sins, even the Rude and Barbarous <hi>Gentiles.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when <hi>Paul</hi> was afraid to stay at <hi>Corinth,</hi> from a Supposition, that some Mischief might befal him there: <hi>Be not afraid</hi> (said the Lord <hi>Jesus</hi> to him) <hi>but speak; and hold not thy peace, for I have much People in this City,</hi> Joh. 10. 16. Act. 18. 9, 10. The People that the Lord here speaks of, were not at this time accounted His, by reason of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:47254:53"/>
a Work of Conversion that already had passed upon them; but by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Gift of the Father, for he had given them unto him: Therefore, was <hi>Paul</hi> to stay here, to speak the Word of the Lord to them; that by his Speaking, the Holy - Ghost might ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually work out their Souls, to the causing them to Come; who was also ready with Heart and Soul, to receive them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, Christ</hi> by these Words also suggesteth, That no more came unto Him, than indeed was given him of the Father: For the <hi>Him</hi> in this place, is one of the <hi>All,</hi> that by <hi>Christ,</hi> was mentioned before. <hi>
                     <hi>All</hi> that the Father giveth Me, shall come to Me;</hi> and <hi>every <hi>Him,</hi>
                  </hi> of that All, I will in no wise cast out. This the Apostle insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ateth, where he saith; <hi>He gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some Evangelists, and some Pastors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Ministry, for the edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Body of</hi> Christ: <hi>Till we <hi>All</hi> come in the Unity of the Faith, and of the Knowledge of the Son of God, unto a Perfect Man, unto the Measure of the</hi>

                  <hi>Stature of the Fulness of</hi> Christ, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p>Mark, As in the Text, so here, he speaketh of <hi>All; Untill we</hi> All <hi>come. We All!</hi> All who? Doubtless, <hi>All</hi> that the Father giveth to <hi>Christ.</hi> This is further insinuated, because he calleth <hi>this</hi> All, The <hi>Body</hi> of Christ, the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Stature of the Fulness of <hi>Christ:</hi> By which he means, the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Number given, to wit, The true Elect Church; which is said to be his Body and Fulness, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 22, 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> by these Words further suggesteth, That he is well content with this Gift of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to him. All <hi>that the Father giveth Me, shall come to Me; and him that cometh to Me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi> I will heartily, willingly, and with great Content of Mind receive him. They shew us also, that <hi>Christ</hi>'s Love in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, is as large as his Father's Love in Giving, and no larger. Hence he thanks him for his Gift; and also thanks him for hiding of Him, and his Things, from the rest of the Wicked, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 25. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10, 21.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> and more particularly.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:47254:54"/>
                  <hi>And</hi> [<hi>him</hi>] <hi>that cometh. And</hi> [<hi>him!</hi>] This word <hi>Him;</hi> By it, <hi>Christ</hi> looketh back to the Gift of the Father; not only in the Lump, and whole of the Gift, but to every <hi>Him</hi> of that Lump. As who should say; I do not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Gift of my Father in the General, but have a special Regard to every of them in Particular; and will secure not only some, or the greatest part; but <hi>Every Him,</hi> every Dust: Not an Hooff of all shall be lost, or left behind. And indeed, in this he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth to his Father's Will; which is, That of All that he hath given him, he should lose Nothing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 39.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And him.</hi>] <hi>Christ Jesus</hi> also, by his thus dividing the Gift of his Father in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Hims<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and by his speaking of them in the <hi>Singular Number,</hi> shews, what a particular Work shall be wrought in each one, at the time appointed of the Father. <hi>And it shall come to pass in that Day,</hi> saith the Prophet, <hi>that the Lord shall beat off from the Channel of the River, to the Stream of</hi> Egypt; <hi>and ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Israel, <hi>Isa.</hi> 27. 12. He shews also hereby, That no Lineage, Kindred, or Relation, can at all be profited by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

Outward or Carnal Union, with the Person that the Father hath given to <hi>Christ.</hi> 'Tis only <hi>Him,</hi> the Given <hi>Him,</hi> the Coming <hi>Him,</hi> that he intends ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely to secure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And him.</hi>] There are divers sorts of Persons, that the Father hath given to <hi>Jesus Christ:</hi> They are not all of one Rank, of one Quality. Some are High, some Low; some are Wise, some Fools; some are more Civil, and Complying with the Law; some more Profane, and averse to Him, and his Gospel. Now, since those that are given to him, are in some sense so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; and again, since he yet saith, <hi>And</hi> Him <hi>that cometh,</hi> &amp;c. He by that doth give us to understand, that he is not, as Men, for picking and choosing, to take a Best, and leave a Worst; but he is for <hi>Him,</hi> that the Father hath given him; and that cometh to him. <hi>He will not alter nor change it; a Good for a Bad, or a Bad for a Good,</hi> Levit. 27. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>There is many a sad Wretch given by the Father to <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> but not one of them all is despised, or slighted by him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:47254:55"/>It is said of those that the Father hath given to <hi>Christ,</hi> That they have done worse than the Heathen; That they were Murderers, Thieves, Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, Unclean Persons, and what not? But he has Received them, Washed them, and Saved them. A fit Emblem of this Sort, is that wretched Instance mentioned in the Sixteenth of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that was cast out in a Stincking Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to the loathing of its Person in the day that it was Born: A Creature in such a wretched Condition, that no Eye pittied, to do any of the Things there mentioned unto it, or to have Compassion upon it: No Eye, but his that speaketh in the Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Him.</hi>] Let him be as red as Blood, let him be as red as Crimson: Some men are blood-Red sinners, Crimson sinners, Sinners of a double die; dipt, and dipt again before they come to Jesus Christ. Art thou that readest these Lines, such an one? speak out man, Art thou such an one? and art thou now coming to Jesus Christ for the Mercy of Justification, that thou mightest be made white in his Blood, and be cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with his Righteousness? Fear not; for as much as this thy coming betoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:47254:56"/>
that thou art of the number of them, that the Father hath given to Christ; for he will in no wise cast thee out. <hi>Come now,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>and let us reason together; though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be as Red as Crimson, they shall be as wooll.</hi> Isa. 1, 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And him</hi>] There was many a strange <hi>him</hi> came to Jesus Christ, in the days of his flesh; but he received them all, without turning any away. <hi>Speaking unto them of the Kingdom of God, and Healing such as had need of healing,</hi> Luk. 9. 11. Chap. 4. 40. These words <hi>And him,</hi> are therefore words to be wondered at: That not one of them, who by vertue of the Fathers gift, and drawing, are coming to Jesus Christ; I say, that not one of them, what ever they have been, what ever they have done, should be rejected, or set by, <hi>But</hi> admitted to a share in his saving grace. 'Tis said in <hi>Luke,</hi> that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>wondred at the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth,</hi> Luk. 4. 22. Now, this is one of his gracious words; these words are like drops of honey, as it is said; <hi>Pleasant words are as an honey-Comb, sweet to the Soul, and health</hi>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:47254:56"/>
                  <hi>to the bones.</hi> These are gracious words indeed, even as full as a faithful, and a merciful High Priest could speak them. <hi>Luther</hi> saith, <hi>When Christ speaketh, he hath a mouth as wide as Heaven and Earth:</hi> That is, to speak fully to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of every sinfull <hi>him,</hi> that is coming to Jesus Christ. And that his word is certain, hear how himself confines it: <hi>Heaven and Earth,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall pass away; but my word shall not pass away,</hi> Isa. 63. 1. Mat. 24. 35.</p>
               <p>It is also confirmed by the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Four Evangelists, who gave faithful relation of his loving reception of all Sorts of coming sinners, whether they were publicans, harlots, thieves possessed of Devils, Bedlams, and what not? <hi>Luk.</hi> 19, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 21. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. Chap. <hi>and</hi> Chap. 23. 41, 42. <hi>Mark.</hi> 19. 9. Chap. 5. 1, 2, 3, to 9.</p>
               <p>This then shews us,</p>
               <p>First, <hi>The greatness of the merits of Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>The willingness of his heart to impute them for Life to the great, if coming, sinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> This shews us the greatness of the Merits of Christ; for it must not be supposed, that his words are bigger than his worthyness. He is Strong to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:47254:57"/>
execute his word; he can <hi>Do,</hi> as well as <hi>Speak. He can do exceeding abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly more than we ask or think,</hi> even to the uttermost, and out side of his word, (<hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 20.)</p>
               <p>Now then, since he concludeth <hi>Any</hi> Coming <hi>Him:</hi> it must be concluded, that he can save to the uttermost Sin, <hi>Any</hi> coming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He speaketh in Righteousness, in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faithfulness, when he began to build this blessed Gospel Fabrick, the Text: It was for that, he had first sat down, and counted the cost; and for that he knew he was able to finish it. What Lord, <hi>
                     <hi>Any</hi> him! <hi>Any</hi> him,</hi> that <hi>cometh</hi> to thee! This is a Christ <hi>worth</hi> look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after, this is a Christ <hi>worth</hi> coming to.</p>
               <p>This then, should learn us diligently to consider the Natural force of every word of God: and to judge of Christ's ability to save; not by our sins, or by our shallow apprehensions of his Grace; but by his word, which is the true measure of Grace.</p>
               <p>And if we do not judge thus, we shall dishonor his Grace, lose the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of his word, and needlesly fright our selves into many Discouragements,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:47254:57"/>
though coming to Jesus Christ. <hi>Him, any</hi> him that cometh, hath from this word of Christ, to feed himself with hopes of Salvation. As thou art therefore coming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O thou coming sinner, Judge thou, whether Christ can savethee, by the true Sense of his words? Judge, coming sinner, of the Efficacy of his Blood, of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his Righteousness, and of the prevailancy of his intercession, by his word. <hi>And him,</hi> saith he, <hi>that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi> In <hi>no wise,</hi> that is, for no Sin: Judge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by his word, how able he is to save thee? It is said of Gods Sayings to the Children of <hi>Israel; There failed not ought of any good thing, which the Lord had spoken to the house of</hi> Israel; <hi>all came to pass.</hi> And again; <hi>Not one thing hath failed of, of all the good things which the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lord your God, spoke concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you all are come to pass unto you; and not one thing hath failed thereof,</hi> Josh. 21. 45. Chap. 23. 14.</p>
               <p>Coming sinner, what promise thou findest in the word of Christ, strain it whether thou canst, so thou dost not corrupt it, and his Blood and Merits will answer all, what the word saith, or any true Consequence that is drawn
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:47254:58"/>
there-from, that we may boldly ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon; As here in the Text, he saith; <hi>And <hi>Him</hi> that cometh;</hi> indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively; without the least intimation of the rejection of any, though never so great, if he be a coming-sinner. Take it then for granted, that thou, whoever thou art, if coming, art intended in these words: neither shall it injure Christ at all, if, as <hi>Benhadad's</hi> Servants <hi>served Ahab,</hi> thou shalt catch him at his word. <hi>Now,</hi> saith the Text, <hi>The Men did diligently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve whether any thing would come from him;</hi> to wit, any word of grace; <hi>and did hastily catch it:</hi> And it happened, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi> called <hi>Benhadad,</hi> his <hi>brother.</hi> The men replyed therefore, <hi>Thy brother Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hadad?</hi> catching him at his word, 1 <hi>King</hi> 20. 33. Sinner, coming sinner, serve Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ thus, and he will take it kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at thy hands. When he in his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument called the <hi>Canaanitish</hi> woman, <hi>Dog,</hi> she catcht him at it, and said; <hi>Truth Lord, yet the Dogs eat of the Crumbs that fall from their Masters Table.</hi> I say, she catcht him thus in his words, and he took it kindly; saying, <hi>O woman, great is thy faith! be it unto thee even as thou wilt,</hi> Mat. 15. 26. Catch him, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sinner, catch him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:47254:58"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The other thing that I told you, is shewed us from these words, is this; <hi>The willingness of Christ's heart, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute his merits for Life to the great, if coming, sinner. And him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The awakned coming sinner, doth not so easily question the power of Christ, as his willingness to save him. <hi>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst,</hi> said one, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1. 40. He did not put the <hi>If</hi> upon his power, but upon his will: he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, he <hi>could;</hi> but he was not as fully of perswasion, that he <hi>would.</hi> But we have the same ground to believe, he <hi>will,</hi> as we have to believe he <hi>can;</hi> and indeed, ground for both, is the Word of God. If he was not willing, why did he promise? why did he say, he would receive the coming sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? <hi>Jacob</hi> took him there; <hi>Thou saidst,</hi> says he, <hi>I will surely do thee Good,</hi> Gen. 32. 12. For, from this promise he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that it followed in reason, <hi>He must be willing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Text also gives some ground for us, to draw the same conclusion. <hi>And him that cometh to me, I <hi>Will</hi> in no wise cast out.</hi> Here is his willingness as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted, as well as his power suggested. It is worth your observation, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham's</hi>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:47254:59"/>
Faith considered rather his power, than his willingness; that is, he drew this Conclusion, <hi>I shall have a Child,</hi> from the Power that was in God to fulfill the Promise to him: for he concluded, he was willing give him one, else he would not have promised one. <hi>He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God; being fully perswaded, that what he had promised, he was <hi>able</hi> to perform,</hi> Rom. 4. 20, 21. But was not his faith <hi>exercised,</hi> or tryed, about his willingness too? No, there was no shew of reason for that, because he had promised it; indeed, had he not promised it, he might Lawfully have doubted it; but since he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised it, there was left no ground at all for doubting; because his willingness to give a Son, was demonstrated in his promising him a Son. These words therefore, are sufficient ground to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage any coming sinner, that Christ is willing to his power, to receive him; and since he hath <hi>power</hi> also to do what he <hi>will,</hi> there is no ground at all left to the coming sinner, any more to doubt; but to come in full hope of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, and of being received unto
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:47254:59"/>
grace and mercy. <hi>And him that [com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.]</hi> He saith not, And him that is <hi>Come;</hi> but, and him that <hi>Cometh;</hi> that is, and him, whose heart <hi>begins</hi> to move after me, who is <hi>leaving</hi> all for my sake; <hi>him,</hi> who is looking out, who is on his Journey to me. We must therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish betwixt <hi>coming,</hi> and being <hi>come</hi> to Jesus Christ. He that is <hi>come</hi> to him, has attained of him more sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, what he felt before he wanted; than he has, that but yet is <hi>coming</hi> to him.</p>
               <p>A Man that is <hi>come</hi> to Christ, hath the advantage of him that is but <hi>coming</hi> to him; and that in seven things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> He that is <hi>come</hi> to Christ, is nearer to him, than he that is but <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to him; for he that is <hi>but</hi> coming to him, is yet, in some sense, at a distance from him; as it is said of the coming prodigal; <hi>And while he was yet a great way off, Luk.</hi> 15. Now, he that is nearer to him, hath the best sight of him; and so, is able to make the best Judgement of his wonderful grace &amp; beauty, as God saith; <hi>Let them come near, then let them speak.</hi> And as the Apostle <hi>John</hi> saith; <hi>And we have seen, and do testifie, that God sent his Son to be the Saviour of the world,</hi> Isa. 41. 1. 1 Joh. 4. 14. He
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:47254:60"/>
that is not yet come, though he is <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming,</hi> is not fit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not being indeed ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, to make that Judgement of the worth and glory of the Grace of Christ, as he is that is come to him, and hath seen and beheld it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He that is <hi>come</hi> to Christ, has the advantage of him that is but <hi>coming,</hi> in that he is eased of his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; for he that is but coming, is not, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 28. He that is <hi>come,</hi> has cast his burden upon the Lord; by Faith he hath seen himself released thereof: but he that is but <hi>coming,</hi> hath it yet, as to sense, and feeling, upon his own shoulders. <hi>Come unto me, all ye that Labor, and are heavy Laden,</hi> implies, that their burden, though they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is yet upon them; and so will be, till indeed they are <hi>come</hi> to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He that is <hi>come</hi> to Christ, has the advantage of him that is but <hi>coming:</hi> in this also, namely; He hath drank of the Sweet, and Soul-refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Water of Life; but he that is but <hi>coming,</hi> hath not: <hi>If any man thirst, let him <hi>Come</hi> unto me and drink.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mark, he must <hi>Come</hi> to him, before he drinks; according to that of the Prophet: <hi>Ho every one that thirsteth,</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:47254:60"/>
                  <hi>
                     <hi>Come</hi> ye to the Waters.</hi> He drinketh not as he cometh, but when he is <hi>come</hi> to the Waters, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 37. <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He that is <hi>come</hi> to Christ, hath the advantage of him, that as yet is but coming: in this also, to wit, He is not so terrified with the noise, and, as I may call it, <hi>Hue and Cry;</hi> which the Avenger of blood makes at the heels of him, that yet, is but coming to him. When the Slayer was upon his flight to the City of his refuge, he had the noise or fear of the Avenger of blood at his heels; but when he was come to the City, and was entred there-into, that noise ceased: Even so it is with him, that is but coming to Jesus Christ; he heareth many a dreadful Sound in his ears; sounds of death and damnation; which he that is <hi>come,</hi> is at present freed from. Therefore he saith; <hi>
                     <hi>Come,</hi> and I will give you rest:</hi> And so he saith again; <hi>We</hi> that have believed, do enter into rest, as he said, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now the believing there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, is a believing on Christ; as <hi>come</hi> unto him for rest, is only found in him, by them that are <hi>Come</hi> to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> He therefore that is <hi>come</hi> to Christ, is not so subject to those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, and castings down, by reason
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:47254:61"/>
of the rage and assaults of the evil one; as is the man, that is but coming to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ (tho he has Temptations too.) [<hi>And while he was yet a coming, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil threw him down, and <hi>Lore</hi> him,</hi> Luk. 9. 42.] For he has, though Satan still Roareth upon him, those experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental comforts, and refreshments (to wit) in his treasury, to present himself with, in times of Temptation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict; which he that is but <hi>coming,</hi> has not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> He that is <hi>come</hi> to Christ, has the advantage of him that is but coming to him: in this also, to wit, He hath upon him the Wedding Garment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he that is <hi>coming,</hi> has not. The <hi>Prodigal,</hi> when coming home to his Father, was cloathed with nothing but Rags, and was tormented with an empty belly: but when he was <hi>come,</hi> the best Robe is brought out; also, the Gold Ring, and the shooes; yea, they are put upon him, to his great rejoycing. The fatted Calf was killed for him; the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick was struck up, to make him mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and thus also the Father himself Sang of him; <hi>This my Son was dead, and is alive again; was lost, and is found,</hi> Luk. 15. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, In a word, he that is <hi>come</hi> to

Christ, his groans, and tears, his doubts, and fears, are turned into Songs and Praises; for that he hath now received the atonement, and the earnest of his inheritance: But he that is but yet a <hi>coming,</hi> hath not those Praises, nor Songs of deliverance with him; nor has he as yet, received the atonement, and earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of his Inheritance, which is, the Sealing testimony of the Holy Ghost, through the sprinkling of the Blood of Christ upon his Conscience; for he is not come: <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 11. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22, 23, 24.</p>
               <q>And him that [Cometh]</q>
               <p>There is further to be gathered from this word [<hi>Cometh,</hi>] these following par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> hath his Eye upon, and takes notice of the First Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Heart of a Sinner after him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: Coming-Sinner, thou. canst not move with Desires after <hi>Christ,</hi> but he sees the Working of those Desires in thy Heart. <hi>All my Desires,</hi> said <hi>David, are before thee, and my Groanings are not hid from thee,</hi> Psal. 38. 9. This he spake, as he was coming (after he had back sliden) to the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi> 'Tis-said of the Prodigal, <hi>That while he was yet a great way off, his Father saw</hi>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:47254:62"/>
                  <hi>him,</hi> had his Eye upon him, and upon the going out of his Heart after him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 20.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Nathaniel</hi> was <hi>come</hi> to <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> the Lord said unto them that stood before him; <hi>Behold, an</hi> Israelite <hi>indeed, in whom there is no Guile.</hi> But <hi>Nathaniel</hi> answered him, <hi>Whence know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est thou me. Jesus</hi> answered, <hi>Before that</hi> Philip <hi>called thee, when thou wast under the Fig-Tree, I saw thee.</hi> There, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, <hi>Nathaniel</hi> was pouring out of his Soul to God for Mercy, or that he would give him good Understanding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Messias</hi> to come: And <hi>Jesus</hi> saw all the Workings of his honest Heart at that time, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 47, 48.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zacheus</hi> also had some secret Movings of Heart, such as they was, towards <hi>Jesus Christ;</hi> when he ran before, and climbed up the Tree to see him; and the Lord <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> had his Eye upon him: Therefore, when he was come to the Place, he looked up to him, bids him <hi>come</hi> down; <hi>For to Day</hi> (said he) <hi>I must abide at thy House:</hi> To wit, in order to the further Compleating the Work of Grace in his Soul, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Remember this, Coming-Sinner!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:47254:62"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> has his Eye upon; so he hath his Heart open, to receive the Coming Sinner. This is verified by the Text: <hi>And him that cometh to Me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi> This is also discovered by his preparing of the Way, in his making of it Easie (as may be) to the Coming-Sinner; which Preparation is manifest by them Blessed Words, <hi>I will in no wise cast out:</hi> Of which, more when we come to the Place. And while he was yet a great way off, his Father saw him, <hi>and had Compassion on him; and ran, and fell on his Neck, and kissed him</hi> (Luk. 15. 20.) All these Expressions do strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove, that the Heart of Christ is open to receive the Comming - Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As Jesus Christ has his Eye upon, and his Heart open to receive; so he hath resolved already, that nothing shall alienate his Heart from receiving the Coming-Sinner. No Sins of the Coming-Sinner, nor the Length of the Time that he hath abode in them, shall by any Means prevail with Jesus Christ to reject him. Coming - Sinner, thou art coming to a loving Lord Jesus!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:47254:63"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> These Words therefore are dropt from his Blessed Mouth, on purpose, that the Coming Sinner might take En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to continue on his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, until he be come indeed to Jesus Christ. It was doubtless, a great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to Blind <hi>Bartlimeus,</hi> that Jesus Christ stood still, and called him, when he was crying; <hi>Jesus, thou Son of</hi> David, <hi>have Mercy on me:</hi> Therefore, 'tis said, He cast away his Garment, <hi>Rose up, and <hi>Came</hi> to Jesus,</hi> Mark 10. 46, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, if a Call to <hi>come</hi> hath such Encouragement in it, what is a Promise of Receiving such, but an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement much more? And observe it, though he had a Call to <hi>come,</hi> yet not having a Promise, his Faith was forced to work upon a meer Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: Saying, He calls me; and surely, since he calls me, he will grant me my Desire. Ah! but Coming-Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, thou hast no need to go so far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, as to draw (in this Matter) Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences; because thou hast plain Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises: <hi>And him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi> Here is full, plain; yea, what Encouragement one can desire: For, suppose thou was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to make a Promise thy self, and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:47254:63"/>
Christ should attest, that he would ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil it upon the Sinner, that cometh to him; Couldest thou make a better Promise? Couldest thou invent a more full, free, or larger Promise? A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, that looks at the first Moving of the Heart after Jesus Christ! A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, that declares, yea, that ingageth Christ Jesus to open his Heart, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Coming-Sinner: Yea, further; A Promise, that Demonstrateth that the Lord Jesus is resolved freely to receive, &amp; will in no wise cast out, nor means to reject the Soul of the Coming sinner. For all this lieth fully in this Promise, and doth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally flow there-from. Here thou needest not make use of far-fetcht Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, nor strain thy Wits, to force encouraging Arguments from the Text. Comming-Sinner, the Words are plain; <hi>And him that cometh to Me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>And <hi>Him</hi> that [Cometh.]</q>
               <p>There are two Sorts of sinners that are coming to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Him that hath never, while of late, at all, began to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:47254:64"/>Secondly, <hi>Him that came formerly, and after that went back; but hath since bethought himself, and is now coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both these sorts of sinners are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the <hi>Him</hi> in the Text, as is evident; because, <hi>Both</hi> are now the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinners.</p>
               <q>And <hi>Him</hi> that cometh, &amp;c.</q>
               <p>For the first of these; the sinner that hath never, while of late, began to come, his way is more easie: I do not say, more plain, and open, to come to Christ, than is the other, (those last not having the Clog of a guilty Conscience, for the sin of Back-sliding hanging at their Heels.) But all the incouragement of the Gospel, (with what invitations are therein contained) to coming sinners, are as <hi>free,</hi> and as <hi>open</hi> to the one as to the other; so that they may with the <hi>same</hi> freedom and liberty, as from the word, both alike claim interest in the promise. <hi>All things are ready:</hi> All things, for the coming back-sliders, as well as for the others: <hi>Come to the Wedding: And let him that is a thirst, come,</hi> Mat. 22. 1, 2, 3, 4. Revel. 22. 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:47254:64"/>But having spoken to the first of these already, I shall here pass it by; and shall speak a word or two to him that is coming, after back-sliding, to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ for life.</p>
               <p>Thy way, O thou sinner of a double dye, thy way is <hi>open</hi> to come to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ: I mean, <hi>thee</hi> whose heart, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long back-sliding, doth think of turning to him again. Thy way, I say, is open to him, as is the way of the other sorts of Comers; as appears by what follows.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Because the Text makes no Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception against thee;</hi> it doth not say, And <hi>any</hi> him; <hi>But,</hi> a back-slider; <hi>any him,</hi> But <hi>him:</hi> The Text doth not thus object, but indifinitively openeth wide its <hi>Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Arms,</hi> to every coming soul, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least Exception. Therefore thou maist come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Nay, the Text is so far from excepting against thy coming, that it strongly suggesteth, that thou art one of the souls intended, O thou coming back-slider: Else, what need that Clause. have been so inserted, <hi>I will in no wise cast out:</hi> No, as who should say, though those that come now, are such as have formerly back-sliden. I will in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:47254:65"/>
                  <hi>No</hi> wise cast a way the Fornicator, the Covetous, the Railer, the Drunkard, or other common Sinners; nor yet the Back-slider neither.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Back-slider is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, is evident,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> For that he is sent to <hi>By <hi>Name:</hi> Go, tell his Disciples, and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
                  </hi> Mark 16. 7. But <hi>Peter</hi> was a God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Man: True; but he was also a Back-slider: yea, a desperate Back-slider. He had Denyed his Master once, twice, thrice; Cursing and Swearing, that he knew him not. If this was not Back-sliding; if this was not an High and Eminent Back-sliding; yea, a higher Back-sliding than thou art ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, I have thought amiss.</p>
               <p>Again, When <hi>David</hi> had back-sliden, and had committed Adultery and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in his Back-sliding, he must be sent to by <hi>
                     <hi>Name.</hi> And,</hi> saith the Text, <hi>the Lord sent</hi> Nathan <hi>to</hi> David. And he sent him to tell him, after he had brought him to unfeigned Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Fact; <hi>The Lord hath also put away, or forgiven <hi>Thy</hi> Sin,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. 1.</p>
               <p>This Man also was far gone; He took a Man's Wife, and Kill'd her Husband; and endeavoured to cover all
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:47254:65"/>
with wicked dissimulation he did this, I say, after God had exalted him, and shewed him great favor, wherefore his Transgression was greatned also by the Prophet with mighty aggravations: yet, he was accepted, and that with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, at the first step he took in this returning to Christ; for the first step of the back-sliders return, is to say sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly, and unfeignedly, <hi>I have sinned:</hi> But he had no sooner said this, but a pardon was produced, yea thrust into his bosom. <hi>And Nathan said unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> the Lord hath also put away <hi>Thy</hi> sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As the person of the back-slider is mentioned by <hi>Name,</hi> so also is his <hi>Sin,</hi> that if possible thy Objections against thy returning to Christ, may be taken out of thy way. I say it is mentioned, and mixed as mentioned with words of grace and favor. <hi>I will heal their backsliding,</hi> and love them freely, (<hi>Hos.</hi> 14, 4.). What sayest thou now back-slider!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Nay further, thou art not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned by <hi>name,</hi> and thy <hi>sin</hi> by the <hi>nature</hi> of it, but thou thy self who art a <hi>returning back - slider, put</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:47254:66"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Among Gods <hi>
                     <hi>Israel.</hi> Return O back-sliding</hi> Israel, <hi>saith the Lord, and I will not cause mine anger to fall upon you: <hi>For</hi> I am mercifull, saith the Lord, and will not keep anger for ever,</hi> Jer. 3. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thou art put among his <hi>Children,</hi> among his Children to whom he is <hi>married.</hi> Turn O back-sliding Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, for I am married unto you, <hi>vers.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Yea after all this, as if his heart was so full of Grace for them, that he was pressed untill he had utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it before them, he adds, <hi>Return ye back-sliding Children, and I will heal your back-slidings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Nay further, the Lord hath considered, that the <hi>shame</hi> of thy <hi>sin</hi> hath stopped thy mouth, and made thee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most a prayer-less man; and therefore he saith unto thee, <hi>Take with you words, and turn unto the Lord, and say unto him, take away all iniquity and receive us graciously:</hi> See his grace! that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self should put words of incouragement into the heart of a back-slider: As he saith in another place, <hi>I taught</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim <hi>to go, taking him by the Arms. This</hi> is teaching him to go indeed, to put words into his mouth, to hold him
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:47254:66"/>
up by the Arms, by the Chin, as we say, <hi>Hos.</hi> 14. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 3.</p>
               <p>From what hath been said I conclude, even as I said before, that the <hi>Him</hi> in the Text, <hi>And him that cometh,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth both these sorts of Sinners, and therefore both should freely come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Question,</hi> But where doth Jesus Christ, in all the words of the New - Testament, Expresly speak to a returning back-slider with words of Grace and Peace? For what you have urged as yet, from the New Testament, is nothing but Consequences drawn from this <hi>Text.</hi> Indeed it is a full <hi>Text</hi> for carnal ignorant sinners that come, but to me who am a back-slider it yeeldeth but little relief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> First, How! but little incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement from the Text, when it saith, <hi>I will in no wise cast out?</hi> What more could have been said? what is here o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that might have been inserted, to make the promise more full and free? Nay, take all the promises in the Bible, all the freest promises, with all the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety <hi>of</hi> expressions of what nature or extent soever, and they can but amount to the expressions of this very promise; <hi>I will in <hi>no wise</hi> cast out:</hi> I will for nothing, by no means, upon no account, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:47254:67"/>
they have sinned, however they have back-sliden, however they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, cast out the coming sinner. But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thou sayst, where doth Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ in all the words of the New-Testament, speak to a returning back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slider with words of Grace and Peace? <hi>that is, under the name of a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slider.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Where there is such plenty of examples in receiving back-sliders, there is the less need of Express words to that intent; one promise, as the Text is, with those Examples that are annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are instead of many promises. And besides, I reckon that the Act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, is of as much, if not of more incouragement, than is a bare promise to receive; for receiving is as promise, and the fulfilling of it too: So that in the <hi>Old</hi> Testament thou hast the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and in the <hi>New,</hi> the fulfilling of it: and that in divers examples.</p>
               <p>1 In <hi>Peter. Peter</hi> denyed his Master, once, twice, thrice, and that with open oath; yet Christ receives him again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any the least hesitation or stick. Yea he slips, stumbles, falls again, in down right Dissimulation, and that to
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:47254:67"/>
the hurt and fall of many others; but neither of this doth Christ make a bar to his Salvation, but receives him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at his return, as if he knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the fault, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The rest of the disciples, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all of them, backslide and leave the Lord Jesus in his greatest straights: <hi>Then all the Disciples forsook him and fled, they returned,</hi> (as he had fore-told) <hi>every one to his own, and left him alone;</hi> but this also, he passes over as a very light mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; not that it was so indeed, in it self, but the abundance of grace that was in him did lightly <hi>role</hi> it away; for after his Resurrection, when at first he appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto them, he gives them not the least check for their perfidious dealing with them, but salutes them with words of Grace, saying; <hi>All hail, be not afraid, Peace be to you; All Power in Heaven and Earth is given unto me.</hi> True, he rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked them for their unbelief, for the which thou also deservest the same; for, 'tis unbelief that alone puts Christ and his benefits from us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26. 56. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 32. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 9, 10, 18. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 36. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The man that after a large profession, lay with his Fathers Wife,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:47254:68"/>
committed a high Transgression, even such an one, that at that day was not heard of, no, not among the Gentiles. Wherefore this was a desperate. back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding; yet at his return, he was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and accepted again to Mercy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1, 2. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Thief that stole, was bid to steal no more; not at all doubting but that Christ was ready to forgive him this Act of backsliding, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 28.</p>
               <p>Now all these are Examples, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar instances of Christs readiness to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Backsliders to Mercy; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve it, examples and proofs that he <hi>hath</hi> done so, are to our unbelieving hearts, stronger incouragements, than bare Promises, that so he <hi>will</hi> do. But again, the Lord Jesus hath added to those for the incouragement of retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Backsliders, to come to him,</p>
               <p>First, <hi>A Call to come,</hi> and he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 14, 15, 16, 20, 21, 22. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 3, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. Wherefore, New Testament Backsliders have incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Declaration of readiness to receive them that Come, as here in the Text, and in many other places is plain:
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:47254:68"/>
Therefore, <hi>Set thee up these Marks, make thee these high heaps</hi> (of the golden Grace of the Gospel,) <hi>set thine heart towards the high-way, even the way that thou went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est</hi> (when thou didst backslide) <hi>turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, O Virgin of Israel; turn again to these thy Cities,</hi> Jer. 31. 21.</p>
               <p>And him that [<hi>Cometh.</hi>] He saith not, And <hi>him</hi> that talketh, that professeth, that maketh a shew, a noise, or the like, but <hi>him that Cometh.</hi> Christ will take leave to judge, who, among the many that make a Noise, they be that indeed are <hi>coming to him.</hi> It is not him that saith he <hi>comes,</hi> nor him of whom others affirm that he <hi>comes;</hi> but him that Christ himself shall say <hi>doth Come;</hi> that is concern'd in this Text. When the Woman that had the bloody Issue came to him for Cure, there were others as well as she, that made a great bussle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, that touched, yea thronged him; Ah, but Christ could distinguish this woman from them all. <hi>And he looked round about upon them all, to see</hi> her <hi>that had done this thing,</hi> Mar. 25. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32. He was not concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the thronging, or touchings of the rest; for theirs were but accidental, or, at best, void of that which made her
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:47254:69"/>
touch acceptable. Wherefore Christ must be Judg who they be that in Truth are coming to him; <hi>Every mans way is right in his own Eyes, but the Lord weigheth the Spirits:</hi> It standeth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every one in hand to be certain of their coming to Jesus Christ; for as thy coming is, so shall thy Salvation be: If thou comest indeed, thy Salvation shall be indeed; but if thou comest but in outward appearance, so shall thy Salvation be: But of coming see be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as also afterwards in the Use and Application.</p>
               <q>And him that cometh [<hi>to me.</hi>]</q>
               <p>These words [<hi>to me,</hi>] are also well to be heeded; for by them, as he secureth those that come to him, so also he shews himself unconcerned with those that in their coming rest short, or turn aside to others; For you must know, that every one that comes, comes not to Jesus Christ; some that come, came to <hi>Moses,</hi> and to his Law, and then take up for Life; with these Christ is not concerned; with these this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise hath not to do. <hi>Christ is become of none</hi> effect <hi>unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the Law, ye are falen from</hi>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:47254:69"/>
                  <hi>grace,</hi> Gal. 5. 3, 4. Again, some that came, come no farther than to Gospel Ordinances, and there stay, they come not through them to Christ; with these neither is he concerned; nor will their <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> avail them any thing in the great and dismal day. A man may come too, and also go from the place and Ordinances of Worship, and yet not be remembred by Christ. <hi>So I saw the wicked buried,</hi> said Solomon, <hi>who had come and gone from the place of the Holy, and they were forgotten in the City; when they had so done, this is also Vanity,</hi> Eccles. 8. 10.</p>
               <p>[<hi>To me.</hi>] These words therefore, are by Jesus Christ very warily put in, and serve for <hi>caution,</hi> and <hi>incouragement:</hi> for <hi>caution,</hi> lest we take up, in our coming, any where short of Christ; and for <hi>incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement</hi> to those that shall in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, come past all, till they come to Jesus Christ; <hi>And him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reader, If thou lovest thy Soul, take this <hi>Caution</hi> kindly at the hands of Jesus Christ. Thou seest thy Sickness, thy Wound, thy necessity of Salvation; well, go not to King <hi>Jareb,</hi> for he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not Heal thee, nor Cure thee of thy
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:47254:70"/>
Wound (<hi>Hos.</hi> 5. 13.) Take the <hi>Caution,</hi> I say, lest Christ, insteed of being a Saviour to thee, becomes a Lion, a young Lion to tare thee, and go away, <hi>vers.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>There is a coming, but not to the most High; there is a coming, but not with the whole Heart, but as it were feignedly; therefore take the <hi>Caution</hi> kindly, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 10. <hi>Hos.</hi> 7. 16.</p>
               <p>And him that cometh [<hi>To me.</hi>] Christ, as a Saviour, will stand alone, because his own Arm above hath brought Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation unto him; He will not be joyned with <hi>Moses,</hi> nor suffer <hi>John</hi> Baptist to be tabernacled by him: I say, they must vanish, for Christ will stand alone, (<hi>Luk</hi> 9. 28, 36.) yea, God the Father will have it so; therefore, they must be parted from him, and a Voice from Heaven must come to bid the Disciples hear, only <hi>the beloved Son.</hi> Christ will not suffer any Law, Ordinance, Statute, or Judgement, to be partners with him in the salvation of the Sinner. Nay, he saith not, And him that cometh to my <hi>Word;</hi> but, And him that cometh to <hi>me.</hi> The words of Christ, even his most blessed and free Promises, such as this in the Text, are not the Saviour of the World;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:47254:70"/>
for that is Christ himself; Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self only. The Promises therefore, are but to incourage the coming sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to come to Jesus Christ, and not to rest in them short of Salvation by him.</p>
               <p>And him that cometh [<hi>To me.</hi>] The man therefore that comes aright, casts all things behind his back; and looketh at, nor hath his expectation from ought but the Son of God alone, as <hi>David</hi> said; <hi>My Soul, wait thou</hi> only <hi>upon God, for my expectation is from him: He only is my Rock, and my Salvation; he is my Defence, I shall not be moved,</hi> Psal. 62. 5. His Eye is to Christ, his Heart is to Christ, and his expectation is from him, from him <hi>only.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, the man that comes to Christ, is one that hath had deep Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations of his own sins, slighting thoughts of his own Righteousness, and high thoughts of the Blood and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of Jesus Christ; yea he sees, as I have said, more vertue in the Blood of Christ to save him, than there is in all his sins to damn him. He therefore setteth Christ before his Eyes, there is nothing in Heaven or Earth, he knows, that can save his Soul, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:47254:71"/>
secure him from the Wrath of God, but Christ; that is, nothing but his personal Righteousness, and Blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And him that cometh to me, I will [in no wise] cast out. In no wise:</hi> By these words there is somthing expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, and somthing implyed. That which is expressed, is Christ Jesus his unchangable Resolution to Save the Coming sinner; <hi>I will in no wise</hi> reject him, or deny him the benefit of my Death and Righteousness. This word therefore is like that which he speaks of the everlasting damnation of the sinner in Hell-fire, <hi>He shall by no means depart thence; that is, never,</hi> never, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come out again; no, not to all Eternity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 25. <hi>chap.</hi> 25. 46. So that, as he that is condemned into Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire, hath no ground of hope for his deliverance thence; so him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Christ, hath no ground to fear he shall ever be cast in thither.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus saith the Lord, If Heaven a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove can be measured, or the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Earth searched out beneath, I will also cast away all the seed of</hi> Israel, <hi>for all that they have done, saith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 31. 37.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus saith the Lord, if my Covenant</hi>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:47254:71"/>
                  <hi>be not with Day and Night, and if I have not appointed the Ordinances of Heaven, and Earth, then will I cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Seed of</hi> Jacob. But Heaven can not be measured, not the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth searched out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath; his Covenant is also with day and night, and he hath appointed the Ordinances of Heaven; therefore he will not cast away the Seed of <hi>Jacob,</hi> who are the coming ones; but will certainly save them from the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Wrath to come, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33. 25, 26. <hi>chap.</hi> 50. 4, 5. By this therefore it is manifest, that it is not the greatness of sin, nor thy long continuance in it, no, nor yet thy back-sliding, nor the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thy Nature, that can put a bar in against, or be an hinderance of the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the coming sinner. For, if indeed this could be, then would this solemn and absolute Determination of the Lord Jesus, of its self fall to the ground, and be made of none effect: <hi>But his Counsel shall stand, and he will do all his pleasure.</hi> That is, his pleasure in this; for this promise, this irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible conclusion, ariseth of his Pleasure; and he will stand to it, and will fulfil it, because it is his pleasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:47254:72"/>Suppose that one man had the sins, or as many sins as an hundred, and another should have an hundred times as many as he; yet if they come, this word, <hi>I will in no wise cast out,</hi> secures them both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</p>
               <p>Suppose a man hath a desire to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and for that purpose is coming in truth to Jesus Christ, but he by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched Life, has damned many in hell: why, the dore of hope is by these words set as open for him, as it is for him that hath not the thousandth part of his Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. <hi>And him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppose a man is coming to Christ to be Saved, and hath nothing but sin, and an ill-spent life to bring with him; Why, let him come, and welcome to Jesus Christ, <hi>And he will in no wise cast him out,</hi> Luk. 7. 41. Is not this Love that passeth knowledg? is not this Love the wonderment of Angels? and is not this Love worthy of all acceptation at the hands and hearts of coming sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That which is <hi>implyed</hi> in the words, is</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, The coming Souls hath those that continually lie at Jesus Christ, to cast them</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:47254:72"/>Secondly, <hi>The coming Souls are afraid, that these will prevail with Christ to cast them off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For these words are spoken to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us, and to stay up our Spirits against these two dangers: <hi>I will in no wise cast out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> For the First, <hi>Coming Souls have those that continually lye at Jesus Christ to cast them off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And there are three things, that thus bend themselves against the coming sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> There is the <hi>Devil,</hi> that Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser of the brethren, that accuses them before God, day and night, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. 10. This Prince of Darkness is unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in this work; he doth it, as you see day and night, that is, without cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing: He continually puts in his Caveats against thee, if so be he may prevail. How did he ply it against that good man <hi>Job,</hi> if possible he might have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his destruction in Hell fire? He objected against him, that he served not God for nought, and tempted God to put forth his Hand against him; ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, that if he did it, he would Curse him to his face; and all this, as God witnesseth, <hi>He did without a Cause,</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:47254:73"/>
Job 1. 9, 10, 11. <hi>chap.</hi> 2. 4. 5. How did he ply it with Christ against <hi>Joshua</hi> the high Priest? <hi>And he shewed me</hi> Joshua, said the Prophet, <hi>the high Priest, standing before the Angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him,</hi> Zech. 3. <hi>To resist him;</hi> that is, to prevail with the Lord Jesus Christ to resist him: Objecting, the uncleanness and unlawful Marriage of his Sons with the Gentiles; for that was the Crime that Satan laid against them, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. 18. Yea, and for ought I know, <hi>Joshua</hi> was also guilty of the fact; but if not of that, of Crimes no whit inferior; for he was <hi>Cloathed with filthy Garments, as he stood before the Angel:</hi> neither had he one word to say in vindication of himself, against all that this wicked one had to lay against him: But notwithstanding that, he came off well; but he might for it, thank a good Lord Jesus, because he did not resist him; but contrariwise took up his cause, pleaded against the Devil, excused his infirmity, and put justifying Robes upon him before his Adversaries Face.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Lord said unto Satan, The Lord Rebuke thee, O Satan, even the</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:47254:73"/>
                  <hi>Lord that hath chosen</hi> Jerusalem <hi>Rebuke thee. Is not this a Brand pluckt out of the Fire. And he answered and spake to those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy Garments from him; and to him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquities to pass from thee, and will Cloath thee with chang of Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, how did Satan ply it against <hi>Peter,</hi> when he desired to have him that he might sift him as Wheat; that is, if possible, sever all Grace from his heart, and leave him nothing but flesh and filth, to the end he might make the Lord Jesus loath and abhor him; <hi>Simon, Simon, said Christ, Satan hath desired to have you, that he might sift you as Wheat.</hi> But did he prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him? No, <hi>But I have prayed for thee, that thy Faith fail not.</hi> As who should say, <hi>Simon,</hi> Satan hath desired me that I would give thee up to him, and not only thee, but all the rest of thy Brethren (for that the word you, imports); but <hi>I</hi> will not leave thee in his hand, <hi>I</hi> have prayed for thee, thy saith shall not sail: <hi>I</hi> will secure thee to the Heavenly Inheritance, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 30, 31, 32.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:47254:74"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> As Satan, <hi>so every sin,</hi> of the coming-sinner, comes in with a Voice against him, if perhaps they may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with Christ to cast off the Soul. When <hi>Israel</hi> was coming out of <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Canaan,</hi> how many times had their sins thrown them out of the mercy of God, had not <hi>Moses</hi> as a Type of Christ, stood in the breach to turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his VVrath from them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 23. our Iniquities testify against us, and would certainly prevail against us, to our utter rejection and Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, had we not an Advocate with the Father Jesus Christ the Righteous, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>The sins of the old World cryed them down to Hell, the sins of <hi>Sodom</hi> fetched upon them Fire from Heaven, which devoured them; the sins of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> cryed them down to Hell, because they came not to Jesus Christ for Life. Coming-sinner, thy sins are no whit less than any; Nay, perhaps, they are as big as all theirs: VVhy is it then that thou livest when they are dead, and that thou hast a promise of Pardon when they had not? <hi>Why thou art coming to Jesus Christ,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sin shall not be thy ruin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:47254:74"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As <hi>Satan,</hi> and <hi>Sin;</hi> so the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moses,</hi> as it is a Perfect Holy Law, hath a Voice against thee before the Face of God: <hi>There is one that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even</hi> Moses's <hi>Law,</hi> Jo. 5. Yea, it accuseth all Men of Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that have sinned against it; for as long as Sin is Sin, there will be a Law to accuse for Sin: But this Accusation shall not prevail against the Coming-Sinner; because 'tis Christ that dyed, and that ever lives, to make Intercession for them that <hi>Come to God by him,</hi> Rom. 8. Heb. 7. 25.</p>
               <p>These things, I say, do accuse us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ <hi>Jesus;</hi> yea, and also to our own Faces, if perhaps they might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail against us. But these words, <hi>I will in no wise cast out,</hi> secureth the Coming-Sinner from them all.</p>
               <p>The Coming-Sinner is not saved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is none comes in against him; but because the Lord Jesus will not hear their Accusations; will not cast out the Coming-Sinner.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Shimei</hi> came down to meet King <hi>David,</hi> and to ask for Pardon for his Rebellion; up starts <hi>Abishai,</hi> and puts in his Caveat, saying; <hi>Shall not</hi> Shimei <hi>dye for this?</hi> This is the Case of him that
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:47254:75"/>
comes to Christ; He hath this <hi>Abishai,</hi> and that <hi>Abishai,</hi> that presently steps in against him, saying; Shall not this Rebel's Sins destroy him in Hell? Read further; <hi>But</hi> David <hi>answered; What have I to do with you, ye Sons of</hi> Zeruiah, <hi>that you should this day be Adversaries to me? Shall there any Man be put to Death this Day in</hi> Israel? <hi>for do not I know, that I am King this Day over</hi> Israel? 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.</p>
               <p>This is Christ's Answer by the Text, to all that accuse the Coming-<hi>Shimeis;</hi> What have I to do with you, that accuse the Coming-Sinners to me? I count you Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, that are against my shewing Mercy to them. Do not I know, that I am Exalted this Day to be King of Righteousness, and King of Peace. <hi>I will in no wise cast them out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> But again; These Words do closely imply, that the Coming-Souls are afraid, that these Accusers will prevail against them; as is evident, because the Text is spoken for their Relief and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour: For that need not be, if they that are coming, were not subject to fear, and despond upon this account. Alas! there is Guilt, and the Curse lies upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of the Coming-Sinner!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:47254:75"/>Besides, He is Conscious to himself, what a Villain, what a Wretch he hath been against God, and Christ. Also, he now knows, by woful Experience, how he hath been at <hi>Satan</hi>'s Beck, and at the Motion of every Lust. He hath now also, new Thoughts of the Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and Justice of God: Also, he feels, that he cannot forbear sinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; <hi>For the Motions of Sin, which are by the Law, do work in his Members, to bring forth Fruit unto Death,</hi> (Rom. 7.) But none of this needs be, since we have so Good, so Tender-hearted, and so Faithful a <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> to come to; who will rather over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw Heaven and Earth, than suffer a little of this Text to fail: <hi>And him that comes unto me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, We have yet to enquire into, two things that lie in the Words, to which there hath yet been nothing said: As,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>What it is to cast out.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>How it appears, that Christ hath Power to Save, or to Cast out.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>For the First of these, <hi>What it is to Cast out;</hi> to this I will speak,</p>
               <list>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:47254:76"/>
                  <item>1. Generally.</item>
                  <item>2. More Particularly.</item>
               </list>
               <p>More Generally;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, To cast out,</hi> Is to Slight, and Despise, and Contemn; as it is said of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Shield, <hi>It was vilely cast away;</hi> that is; Slighted and Contemned. Thus it is with the Sinners, that come not to Jesus Christ; He Slights, Despises, and Contemns them; that is, <hi>Casts them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> 2 Sam. 1. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Things cast away, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted as Menstruous Cloaths, and as the Dirt of the Street, <hi>Isa.</hi> 3. 22. <hi>Psal.</hi> 18. 42. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 13. Chap. 15. 17. And thus it shall be with the Men, that come not to Jesus Christ; they shall be counted as Menstruous, and as the Dirt in the Streets.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To be cast out, or off; it is, To be abhorred, not to be pityed; but to be put to perpetual Shame, <hi>Psal.</hi> 44. 9. <hi>Psal.</hi> 89. 38. <hi>Amos</hi> 1. 11.</p>
               <p>But more particularly, To come to the Text: The Casting-out here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, is not limited to this, or the other Evil: Therefore, it must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the most extream and utmost Misery; Or thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:47254:76"/>He that cometh to Christ, shall not want any thing, that may make him Gospelly Happy in this World, or that which is to come: Nor shall he want any thing, that cometh not, that may make him Spiritually and Eternally Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable!</p>
               <p>But further: As it is to be General<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, so it respecteth Things that are now; and also, Things that shall be hereafter.</p>
               <p>For the Things that are now; they are either,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. More General;</item>
                  <item>2. Or more Particular.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> More General, thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>It is <hi>To be cast out</hi> of the Presence and Favour of God.</p>
               <p>Thus was <hi>Cain cast out: Thou hast driven</hi> (or cast) <hi>me out this Day from thy Presence; and from thy Face</hi> (that is, from thy Favour) <hi>shall I be hid.</hi> A dreadful Complaint! but the Effect of a more dreadful Judgement! <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 13, 14. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 39. I <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, To be cast out,</hi> is to be cast out of God's Sight: God will look after them no more, care for them no more; nor will he watch over them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more for Good, (2 <hi>King.</hi> 17. 20.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:47254:77"/>
                  <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 15.) Now, they that are so, are left like Blind Men, to wander, and fall into the Pit of Hell: This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, is also a sad Judgement! There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, here is the Mercy of him that <hi>Cometh</hi> to Christ; He shall not be left to wander at Uncertainties: The Lord Jesus Christ will keep him, as a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard doth his Sheep, <hi>Psal.</hi> 23. <hi>Him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, To be cast out,</hi> Is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed a Place in God's House; and to be left as Fugitives and Vagabonds, to pass a little time away in this Mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Life; and after that, to go down to the Dead, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 30. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 13, 14. Chap. 21. 10. Therefore, here is the Benefit of him that <hi>Cometh</hi> to Christ; He shall not be denyed a Place in God's House: They shall not be left, like Vagabonds in the World. <hi>Him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out;</hi> See <hi>Prov.</hi> 14. 26. <hi>Isa.</hi> 56. 3, 4, 5. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 19, 20, 21, 22. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 21, 22, 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In a word; <hi>To be cast out,</hi> Is to be Rejected, as are the Fallen Angels: For, their Eternal Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on began at their being cast down from
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:47254:77"/>
Heaven to Hell. So then, <hi>Not to be cast out,</hi> Is to have a Place, a House, and Habitation there; and to have a Share in the Priviledges of Elect An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
               <p>These Words therefore, <hi>I will not cast out,</hi> will prove great Words one Day, to them that come to Jesus Christ, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 31. <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. <hi>Luk.</hi> 20. 35.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> and more Particularly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Christ hath Everlasting Life for him that cometh to him, and he shall never Perish; <hi>For he will in no wise cast him out:</hi> But for the rest, they are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, <hi>Cast out;</hi> and must be Damned, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 27, 28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Christ hath Everlasting Righteousness, to cloath them with, that come to him; and they shall be covered with it, as with a Garment: But the rest shall be found in the Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Rags of their own stinking Poluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and shall be wrapt up in them, as in a Winding-sheet; and so bear their Shame before the Lord, and also, before the Angels, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 24. <hi>Isa.</hi> 57. 2. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 4, 18. Chap. 15. 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:47254:78"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Christ hath pretious Blood, that like an open Fountain, stands free for him to wash in, that comes to him for Life; <hi>And he will in no wise cast him out:</hi> But they that come not to him, are Rejected from a Share there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and are left to ireful Vengeance for their Sins, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13. 1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18, 19. <hi>Job.</hi> 13. 8. Chap 3. 36.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Christ hath precious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises; and they shall have a Share in them, that come to him for Life: <hi>For he will in no wise cast them out.</hi> But they that come not, can have no Share in them; because they are <hi>True</hi> only in him: For in Him, and only in Him, all the Promises are <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi> Wherefore, they that come not to him, are no whit the better for them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20, 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Christ hath all Fulness of Grace in himself, for them that come to him for Life; <hi>And he will in no wise cast them out:</hi> But those that come not to him, are left in their Graceless State; and as Christ leaves them, Death, Hell, and Judgement finds them. <hi>He that findeth me</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>findeth Life, and shall obtain Favour of the Lord; but he that sins against me, wrongeth his own Soul:</hi>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:47254:78"/>
                  <hi>All that hate Me, love Death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Prov. 8. 33, 34, 35, 36.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Christ is an Intercessor; and ever liveth to make Intercession for them, that come to God by him: <hi>But their Sorrows shall be multiplyed, that hasten after another</hi> (or other) <hi>Gods,</hi> (their Sins and Lusts;) <hi>Their Drink-Offerings will he not offer, nor take up their Names into his Lips,</hi> Psal. 16. 4. Heb. 7. 25.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Christ hath wonderful Love, Bowels, and Compassions, for those that come to him! For, <hi>He will in no wise cast them out.</hi> But the rest will find him a Lyon Rampant; he will, one Day, tear them all to peices. Now, <hi>Consider this</hi> (saith he) <hi>ye that forget God; lest I tare you in peices, and there be none to deliver you,</hi> Psal. 50. 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Christ is He, by, and for whose sake, those that come to him, have their Persons and Performances accepted of the Father; <hi>And he will in no wise cast them out:</hi> But the rest must flye to the Rocks and Mountains, for Shelter, but all in vain, to hide them from his Face, and Wrath, <hi>Revel.</hi> 6. 15, 16, 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:47254:79"/>But again; These Words [<hi>Cast out</hi>] have a special Look to what will be hereafter; even at the Day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: For then, and not till then, will be the great <hi>Anathema,</hi> and <hi>Cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out,</hi> made manifest, even manifest by Execution. Therefore, here to speak to this, and that under these two Heads; As,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Of the Casting out it self.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Of the Place into which they shall be cast, that shall then be cast out.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, The Casting out it self,</hi> stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in two Things;</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In a Preparitory Work.</item>
                  <item>2. In the manner of Executing the Act.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The Preparitory Work standeth in these three Things:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It standeth in <hi>their</hi> Separation, that have not come to him, from them that have, at that Day: Or thus; At the Day of the great <hi>Casting out,</hi> those that have not (<hi>now</hi>) come to him, shall be separated from them that <hi>have;</hi> for <hi>them</hi> that have, <hi>He will not cast out. When the Son of Man shall come in his Glory, and all the Holy Angels with him, then he shall sit upon the Throne of his Glory; and before him shall be gathered</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:47254:79"/>
                  <hi>all Nations; and he shall separate them one from another, as a Shepheard divideth the Sheep from the Goats,</hi> Matth. 25. 31, 32.</p>
               <p>This dreadful Separation, therefore, shall then be made, betwixt them that (<hi>now</hi>) come to Christ, and them that come not: And good Reason; for since they would not with us come to him, <hi>now</hi> they have time; Why should they stand with us, when Judgement is come?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> They shall be placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him according to their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; they that have come to him, in great Dignity, even at his right hand, <hi>For he will in no wise cast them out:</hi> but the rest shall be set at his left hand, the place of disgrace and shame; for they did not come to him for Life.</p>
               <p>Distinguished also shall they be, by fit terms: Those that came to him, he calleth <hi>Sheep,</hi> but the rest are <hi>
                     <hi>Frowish</hi> Goats. And he shall separate them one from another, as the Shepherd divideth the Sheep from the Goats;</hi> and the <hi>Sheep will he set on the right hand</hi> (next Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Gate, for they came to him); <hi>but the Goats on his left,</hi> to go from him
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:47254:80"/>
into Hell, because they are not of his Sheep.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Then will Christ proceed to conviction of those that came <hi>not</hi> unto him, and will say, <hi>I was a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and ye took me not in,</hi> or did not come unto me. Their excuse of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, he will slight as dirt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to their final Judgment. Now when these wretched rejectors of Christ shall thus be set before him in their sins, and convicted, this is the preparitory work upon which follows the manner of Executing the Act which will be done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> In the presence of the Holy Angels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Second.</hi> In the presence of all them that in their life-time came to him, by saying unto them. <hi>Depart from me ye Cursed into everlasting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels;</hi> with this Reason annexed to it; For you were cruel to me and mine, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly discovered in these words; <hi>For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat; thirsty, and ye gave me no drink; I was a Stranger, and ye took me not in; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and ye Clothed me not; Sick, and</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:47254:80"/>
                  <hi>in Prison, and ye visited me not,</hi> Mat. 25. 41, 42, 43.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lastly,</hi> Now it remains, that we speak of the place into which these shall be cast, which in the general you have heard already, to wit, the Fire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Devil and his Angels: but in particular, it is thus descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It is called <hi>
                     <hi>Tophet:</hi> For</hi> Tophet <hi>is ordained of Old, yea, for the King</hi> (the Lucifer) <hi>It is prepared, he hath made it deep and large, the pile thereof i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Fire and much Wood, and the Breath of the Lord like a stream of Brimstone doth kindle it,</hi> Isa. 30. 32.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is called <hi>
                     <hi>Hell,</hi> It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for thee to enter into Life halt, or lame, than having two feet to be cast into Hell,</hi> Mar. 9. 45.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is called the <hi>Wine-press of the Wrath of God. And the Angel thrust in his Sickle into the Earth, and gathered the Vine of the Earth (that</hi> is them that did not come to Christ) <hi>and cast them into the great Wine press of the Wrath of God,</hi> Rev. 14. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is called a <hi>Lake of Fire. And whosoever was not found written</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:47254:81"/>
                  <hi>in the Book of Life, was cast into the Lake of Fire,</hi> Rev. 20. 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly, It</hi> is called a <hi>
                     <hi>Pitt.</hi> Thou hast said in thy Heart, I will Ascend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven, I will Exalt my Throne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Stars of God, I will sit also upon the Mount of the Congregation, in the sides of the North—Yet thou shalt be brought down to Hell, to the sides of the <hi>Pitt,</hi> Jsa.</hi> 14. 13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It is called a <hi>bottomless Pit, out</hi> of which the smoak and the Locust came, and <hi>into</hi> which the great Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon was cast; and it is called <hi>Bottomless;</hi> to shew the endlesness of the fall that they will have into it, that come not, in the acceptable time to Jesus Christ; <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 1, 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 20 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> It is called <hi>Outer Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: Bind him hand and foot, and cast him into outer Darkness; and cast ye the unprofitable Servant into outer Darkness, there shall be Weeping, and Nashing of Teeth,</hi> Mat. 22. 13. <hi>chap.</hi> 25. 30.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> It is called a <hi>Furnace of Fire. As therefore the Tares are gathered and burned in the Fire, so shall it be in the end of this World: the Son of Man shall send forth his Angels, and they shall gather out of his Kingdom, all things that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend,</hi>
                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:47254:81"/>
                  <hi>and them that do Iniquity; and shall cast them into a Furnace of Fire, there shall be Wailing and Gnashing of Teeth: And again, So shall it be in the end of the World, the Angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, and shall cast them into a Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace of Fire; there shall be wailing and gnashing of Teeth,</hi> Matt. 13. 41, 42, 43, 48, 49, 50.</p>
               <p>Lastly, It may not be amiss, if in the conclusion of this, <hi>I</hi> shew in few words, to what the things that torment them in this state, are compared. Indeed some of them have bin occasionally mentioned already; as that they are compared,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To wood that burneth.</item>
                  <item>2. To Fire.</item>
                  <item>3. To Fire and Brimstone: But</item>
                  <item>4. It is compared to a Worm, a gnawing Worm, a never dying gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Worm: <hi>They are cast into Hell, where their Worm dieth not,</hi> Mar. 9. 44.</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It is called unquenchable Fire, <hi>He will gather his Wheat into his Garner: but will burn up the Chaff with unquenchable Fire,</hi> Matt. 3. 12. Luk. 3. 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="158" facs="tcp:47254:82"/>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It is called everlasting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. <hi>The Lord Jesus shall descend from Heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming Fire, taking Vengance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ; Who shall be punished with Everlasting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction from the presence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power,</hi> 2 Thes. 1. 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> It is called <hi>Wrath without mixture,</hi> and is given them in the Cup of his Indignation. <hi>If any man Worship the Beast, and his Image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, the same shall drink of the Wine of the VVrath of God, which is powred out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mixture, in the Cup of his Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and he shall be tormented with Fire and Brimstone in the presence of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Angels, and in the presence of the Lamb,</hi> Rev. 14. 9, 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> It is called the second Death, <hi>And death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire, this is the second Death. Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first Resurrection, on such the second Death hath no Power,</hi> Rev. 20. 14. <hi>chap.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:47254:82"/>
                  <hi>Ninthly,</hi> It is called Eternal Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>But He that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of Eternal Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh These three Words!</p>
               <p>Everlasting Punishment!</p>
               <p>Eternal Damnation!</p>
               <p>And for Ever and Ever!</p>
               <p>How will they gnaw, and eat up all the expectation of the end of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery of the Cast-away sinners. <hi>And the smoke of their Torment, ascended up for Ever, and Ever, and they have no rest Day nor Night,</hi> &amp;c. Rev. 14. 11.</p>
               <p>Their behaviour in Hell, is set forth but by four things as <hi>I</hi> know of.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. By calling for Help and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in Vain.</item>
                  <item>2. By Weeping.</item>
                  <item>3. By Wailing.</item>
                  <item>4. By gnashing of Teeth.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And now we come to the second thing that is to be enquired into Namely,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How it appears that Christ hath Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to save, or to Cast out:</hi> For by these words, <hi>I will in no wise cast out,</hi> he declareth that he hath power to do both.</p>
               <p>Now this enquiry admits us to search into two things.</p>
               <list>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:47254:83"/>
                  <item>1 <hi>How it appears that he hath power to save.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2 <hi>How it appears that he hath power to cast out.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>That he hath power to save, appears by that which follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> To speak only of him as he is Mediator: He was Authorized to this blessed work by his Father before the World began. Hence the Apostle saith, He hath chosen us in him, before the Foundation of the World; that is, chosen us in him to be Saved by him, as <hi>Ephesians</hi> the first makes manifest. Hence it is again, that we are said to be Blessed in him before the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World, with all those things that effectually will produce our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Read the same Chapter, with 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He was promised to our first Parents, that he should in the fulness of time, bruise the Serpents Head; and as <hi>Paul</hi> expounds it, redeem them that were under the law: hence since that time, he hath bin reckoned as slain for our Sins, by which means all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers under the first Testament were secured from the wrath to come; hence he is called, <hi>The Lamb slain from the</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, Moses</hi> gave Testimony of him by the Types and Shaddows, and Bloody Sacrifices, that he commanded from the Mouth of God, to be in use for the support of his peoples Faith, until the time of Reformation; which was the time of this Jesus his Death. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. and 10th. Chapters.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fifth,</hi> It is Testified of him in the days of his Flesh, that he had Power on Earth to forgive Sins. <hi>Mark</hi> 2. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixth,</hi> It is Testified also of him by the Apostle <hi>Peter; that God hath exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him with his own Right Hand to be a Prince, and a Saviour, to give Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to</hi> Israel, <hi>and forgiveness of Sins.</hi> Acts 5. 30, 31.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventh,</hi> In a word, This is every where Testified of him, both in the Old Testament and in the New.</p>
               <p>And good reason, that he should be acknowledged and trusted in, as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>

                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He hath Abolished Death, Destroyed the Devil, put away Sin, got the Keys of Hell and Death, is Ascended into Heaven; is there accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God, exalted of God, and bid Sit at his Right Hand as Saviour, and that because his Sacrifice for our Sins pleased God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 15. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 7, 8. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 10, 11. <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 30, 31. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 12, 13.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> God hath received already Millions of Souls into his Paradice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they have received this Jesus for a Saviour, and is resolved to cut him off, and to cast him out of his presence, that will not take him for a Saviour, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 22, 23, 24, 25, 26.</p>
               <p>I intend brevity here; therefore a word to the Second, and so conculde.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How it appears that he hath Power to cast out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This appears also by what follows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The Father (for the service <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> he hath done him as Saviour) <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> made him Lord of all, even Lord <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Quick and Dead. <hi>For to this <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Christ both Died, and Rose, and Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that he might be Lord both of the Dead and Living,</hi> Rom. 14. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Father hath left it with him, to quicken whom he will, to wit, with saving Grace, and to cast out whom he will, for their Rebellion against Him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 21.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:47254:85"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Father hath made him Judge of Quick and Dead, hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all Judgment unto the Son, that all Men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> God will Judge the World by this Man; the day is Appointed for Judgment, and he is Appointed for Judge. <hi>He hath Appointed a day in the which he will Judge the World in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness by that Man,</hi> Acts 17. 31, 32.</p>
               <p>Therefore we must all appear before the Judgment-Seat of Christ, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one may receive for the things done in the Body, according to what they have done. If they have closed with Him, Heaven and Salvation; if they have not, Hell and Damnation.</p>
               <p>And for these Reasons he must be Judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Because of his Humiliation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of his Fathers Word he humbled himself, and he became Obedient unto Death; even the Death of the Cross: <hi>Therefore God hath highly Exalted him, and given him a Name above every Name; that at the Name of Jesus, every Knee should bow; both of things in Heaven, and things on Earth, and things under the Earth; and that every Tongue should</hi>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:47254:85"/>
                  <hi>confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the Glory of God the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This hath respect to his being Judge, and his Sitting in Judgment upon An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and Men, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That all Men might honour the Son, even as they honour the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>For the Father Judgeth no Man, but hath Committed all Judgment unto the Son; that all Men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Joh. 5. 22, 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Because of his Righteous Judgment, this work is fit for no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; it is only fit for the Son of God. For he will reward every Man accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his Ways, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Because he is the Son of Man. He hath given him authority to execute Judgment also, because he is the Son of Man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 27.</p>
               <p>Thus have I in brief passed through this Text by way of explication; my next Work is, to speak to it by way of Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: but I shall be also as brief in that, as the Nature of the thing will admit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All that the Father giveth me shall come to me, and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out,</hi> Joh. 6. 37.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47254:86"/>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:47254:86"/>
               <p>ANd now to come to some Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and a little briefly to speak to them, and then conclude the whole.</p>
               <p>The words thus Explained, affords us many, some of which are these:</p>
               <p>First, <hi>That God the Father, and Christ his Son, are two Distinct Persons in the God-head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That by them</hi> (not Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Holy Ghost) <hi>is contrived, and determined, the Salvation of some of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Man - kind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>That this contrivance, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it self into a Covenant between these Persons in the God-head, which standeth in giving, on the Fathers part; and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, on the Sons.</hi> All that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>giveth me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>That every one that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath given to Christ (according to the mind of God in the Text) shall cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly come to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>That coming to Jesus Christ, is therefore not by the will, wisdom, or power of man: but by the gift, promise, and drawing of the Father. [All that the Father giveth me, <hi>shall</hi> come.</hi>]</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>That Jesus Christ will be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:47254:87"/>
                  <hi>to receive, and will not in any wife reject, those that come, or are coming to him. [And him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi>]</p>
               <p>There are besides these, some other Truths, <hi>implyed,</hi> in the Words: As</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>They that are coming to Jesus Christ, are oft-times heartily afraid that he will not receive them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eightly, <hi>Jesus Christ would not have them, that in Truth are Coming to him, once think, that he will cast them out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These Observations, lie, all of them in the Words, and are plentifully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Scriptures of Truth; but I shall not at this time speak to them all, but shall pass by the first, second, third, fourth, and sixth; partly because, I design brevity, and partly because they are touched upon, in the Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory part of the Text. I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore begin with the <hi>Fifth</hi> Observation, and so make that the <hi>first</hi> in order, in the following discourse.</p>
               <p>First, Then, <hi>Coming to Christ, is not by the will, wisdom, or power of Man, but by the gift, promise, and drawing of the Father.</hi> This Observation stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of two parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> that coming to Christ, is not
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:47254:87"/>
by the Will, Wisdom, or Power of Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> But by the Gift, Promise, and Drawing of the Father. That the Text carrieth this Truth in its bosom, you will find, if you look into the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the first part thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; I shall therefore here follow the Method propounded.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>That coming to Christ is not by the will, wisdom, or power of man: this is true,</hi> because the Word doth flatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It denyeth it to be by the <hi>Will</hi> of man. <hi>Not of blood, nor of the <hi>Will</hi> of the flesh, nor of the <hi>Will</hi> of man.</hi> And again, <hi>It is not of him that <hi>Willeth,</hi> nor of him that</hi> Runneth. Joh. 1. 13. Rom. 9. 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It denyeth it to be of the <hi>Wisdome</hi> of man, as is manifest from these considerations.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>In <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Wisdome of God it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him, that the World by Wisdome should not know him:</hi> Now if by <hi>their</hi> Wisdom they cannot <hi>know</hi> him, it follows, by <hi>that</hi> Wisdome, they cannot come unto him; for coming to him, is not before, but after some knowledge of him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 27. <hi>Psal.</hi> 9. 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:47254:88"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Wisdome of Man, in Gods Account, as to the Knowledge of Christ, is reckoned foolishness. <hi>Hath not God made <hi>Foolish</hi> the Wisdome of this World? and again, the Wisdome of this World is <hi>Foolishness</hi> with God.</hi> If God has made <hi>Foolish,</hi> the Wisdome of this World; and again, if the Wisdom of this World is <hi>Foolishness</hi> with Him: then verily it is not likely, that by that, a Sinner should become so Prudent, as to come to Jesus Christ: especially if you Consider,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the Doctrine of a Crucified Christ, and so of Salvation by him, is the very thing, that is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted foolishness, to the Wisdom of this World; Now, if the very Doctrine of a Crucified Christ, be counted foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by the Wisdom of this World, it cannot be, that by that Wisdom, a man should be drawn out, in his Soul, to come to him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>. 20. Chap. 2. 14. Chap. 3. 19. Chap. 1. 18, 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> God counteth the Wisdom of this World, one of his greatest E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, therefore by that Wisdom no man can come to Jesus Christ. For it is not likely that one of Gods greatest Enemies, should draw a man to that
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:47254:88"/>
which best of all pleaseth God, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Christ doth. Now, that God counteth the Wisdom of this World, one of his greatest Enemies, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> For that it casteth the greatest contempt upon his Sons undertakings, as afore is proved, in that it counts his Crucifixion foolishness; Though <hi>That</hi> be one of the Highest Demonstrations of Divine Wisdom, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Because God hath threatned to destroy it, and bring it to naught, and cause it to perish; Which surely he <hi>would not do,</hi> was it not an Enemy; would it direct men to, and cause them to close with Jesus Christ. See <hi>Isa.</hi> 29. 14. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He hath rejected it from helping in the Ministry of his Word, as a fruitless business, and a thing that comes to naught. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 4, 6, 12, 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Because it causeth to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, those that seek it, and pursue it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 18, 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> And God has proclaimed, <hi>That if any man will be wise in this World,</hi> he must be a fool in the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of this World; and that's the way
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:47254:89"/>
to be wise in the Wisdom of God, <hi>If any man will be wise in this World, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. For the Wisdom of this World is foolishness with God,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Coming to Christ, is not by the power of man.</hi> This is evident, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> From that which goeth before: For mans power, in the puttings forth of it, in this matter, is either stirred up by Love, or sense of Necessity: but the Wisdom of this World, neither gives man love to, or sense of a need of Jesus Christ; therefore his power lieth still, <hi>as from that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> What power has he, <hi>that is dead,</hi> as every natural man, spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, is; Even dead in Trespasses and sinnes. Dead, even as dead to Gods New-Testament things; as he that is in his Grave, is Dead to the things of this World. What power hath he then, whereby to come to Jesus Christ. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 25. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God forbids the mighty man's glorying in his strength, and sayes posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, <hi>By strength shall no man prevaile:</hi> and again, <hi>Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, saith the Lord,</hi> Jer. 9.
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:47254:89"/>
23, 24. 1 Sam. 2, 9. Zech. 4, 6. 1 Cor. 1, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly, Paul</hi> acknowledgeth that man, nay, converted man of himself, hath not a Sufficiency of power in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <hi>to think a good thought;</hi> if not to do that which is least, <hi>for to think, is less than to come;</hi> then no man by his own power can come to Jesus Christ 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Hence we are said to be made willing to come, by the power of God; to be raised from a state of sin to a state of Grace, by the power of God; and to <hi>believe,</hi> that is, to <hi>come,</hi> through the exceeding working of his mighty power, <hi>Psal.</hi> 110. 3. <hi>Col.</hi> 2, 12. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. 18, 20. See also <hi>Job</hi> 40. 6—14.</p>
               <p>But this needed not, if either man had power, or will, to come; or so much, as graciously to think of, willing to come (of themselves) to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>I Should now come to the proof of the Second part of the Observation, but that is occasionally done already, in the Explicatory part of the Text; To which I referr the Reader: For I shall here only, give thee a Text or two more to the same purpose, and so come to the use and application.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:47254:90"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It is Expresly said, <hi>No man can come to me, Except the Father which hath sent me, draw him.</hi> By this Text, there is not only insinuated, that in man is want of <hi>power,</hi> but also of <hi>will,</hi> to come to Jesus Christ, they must be <hi>drawn;</hi> they come not, if they be not <hi>drawn:</hi> and observe, it is not man, no nor all the Angels in Heaven, that <hi>can</hi> draw one sinner to Jesus Christ. <hi>No man cometh to me, except the</hi> Father <hi>which hath sent to me, draw him.</hi> Joh. 6. 44.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Again, <hi>No man can come to me, except it were given him of my Father.</hi> Joh. 6. 65. It is an heavenly gift that maketh man come to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Again, <hi>It is written in the Prophets, they shall be all Taught of God; every one therefore that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh to me.</hi> Joh. 6. 45.</p>
               <p>I shall not enlarge; but shall make some use and application, and so come to the next Observation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Is it so? Is coming to Jesus Christ, <hi>Not by the will, wisdom, or Power of man; but by the gift, promise, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Father?</hi> Then they are to blame, that cry up the will, wisdom, and power of man, as things Sufficient
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:47254:90"/>
to bring men to Christ.</p>
               <p>There are some men, who think they may not be Contradicted, when they plead for the will, wisdom, and power of man, in reference to the things that are of the Kingdom of Christ: But I will say to such a man, he never yet came to understand, that himself is, what the Scripture teacheth Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him: Neither did he ever know, what coming to Christ is, by the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gift, and drawing of the Father. He is such an one that hath set up Gods Enemy in opposition to him, and that continueth in such acts of defiance; and what his end, without a new birth, will be, the Scripture teacheth also: But we will pass this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Is it so? Is coming to Christ, by the gift, promise, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Father? then let Saints here learn, to ascribe their coming to Christ; to the gift, promise, and drawing of the Father. Christian man, bless God, who hath given thee to Jesus Christ, by promise; and again, bless God for that he hath drawn thee to him. And why is it thee! Why not another! O that the glory of Electing love, should rest upon thy head; and that the glory
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:47254:91"/>
of the Exceeding grace of God, should take hold of thy heart, and bring thee to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Is it so? that coming to Christ is by the Father, as aforesaid; then this should teach us to set an high esteem <hi>upon them that indeed are coming to Jesus Christ:</hi> I say, an high esteem on <hi>Them,</hi> for the sake of him, by vertue of whose grace, they are made to come to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>We see, that when men, by the help of humane abilities, do arrive to the Knowledge of, and bring to pass, that which, when done, is a wonder to the World: how he that did it, is esteem'd and commended. Yea, how are his wits, parts, industry, and unweariedness in all, admired; and yet the man, as to this, is but of the World, and his work, the effect of natural ability: The things also attained by him, end in vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and vexation of Spirit. Further, perhaps in the pursute of this his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheivement, he sins against God, wasts his time vainly, and at long run loses his Soul, by neglecting of better things: Yet he is admired! But, I say, if this mans parts, labor, diligence, and the like, will bring him to such applause,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:47254:91"/>
and esteem in the World; what esteem should we have, of such an one that is by the Gift, promise, and power, of God, coming to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> This is a man, with whom God is, in whom God works and walks; a man whose motion is Governed &amp; Steared by the mighty hand of God, and the effectual working of his power. <hi>Hear's a Man!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This man by the power of Gods might, which worketh in him, is able to cast a whole World behind him, with all the lusts, and pleasures of it; and to Charge through all the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties that Men and Devils can set against him. <hi>Hear's a Man!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This man is Travelling to Mount <hi>Zion,</hi> the Heavenly Jerusalem: The City of the living God; And to an innumerable company of Angels; And the Spirits of Just men made Perfect; to God the Judge of all, and to Jesus. <hi>Hear's a Man!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This man can look upon death with comfort, can laugh at destruction, when it cometh; and longs to hear the Sound of the last Trump; And to see his Judge coming in the Clouds of Heaven. <hi>Hear's a Man indeed!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let Christians then esteem each other
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:47254:92"/>
as such: I know you do it; but do it more, and more. And that you may, consider these two or three things:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> These are the Objects of Christs esteem. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 48. <hi>chap.</hi> 15. 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> These are the Objects, of the esteem of Angels. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. 22. chap. 10, 11. chap. 12. 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> These have been the Objects of the esteem of Heathens, when but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced about them. <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 10. <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 13. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 24, 25.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let each of you, then, esteem other bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than themselves,</hi> Philip. 3. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Again, Is it so? that no man comes to Jesus Christ, by the will, wisdom, and power of man; But by the Gift, Promise, and Drawing of the Father. <hi>Then this shews us how horribly ignorant of this such are, who make the man that is coming to Christ, the Object of their contempt and rage.</hi> These are also unreasonable, and wicked men, <hi>men in whom is no faith,</hi> 1 Thes. 3, 2.</p>
               <p>Sinners, did you but know what a blessed thing it is, to come to Jesus Christ, and that by the help, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Father, they do indeed come to him; You would Hang and Burn
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:47254:92"/>
in Hell, a Thousand years, before you would turn your spirit, as you do, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him that God is drawing to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, and also against the God that draws him.</p>
               <p>But faithless Sinners, let us a little Expostulate the matter. What hath this man done against thee, that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Jesus Christ? why dost thou make him the Object of thy scorn; doth his coming to Jesus Christ offend thee? Doth his pursuing of his own Salvation of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend thee? Doth his forsaking of his sins, and pleasures offend thee?</p>
               <p>Poor Coming man! <hi>Thou Sacrificest the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes; and will they not stone thee?</hi> Exod. 8. 26.</p>
               <p>But I say, why offended at this? is he ever the worse, for coming to Jesus Christ, or for his loving, and serving of Jesus Christ? Or is he ever the more a fool, for flying from that which will dround thee in Hell fire, and for seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eternal life? Besides, pray Sirs, consider it, this he doth, not of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but by the drawing of the Father. Come, let me tell thee in thine ear, thou that will not, come to him thy self, and him that would, thou hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drest.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:47254:93"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Thou shalt be judged for one, that hath hated, maligned, and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> to whom this poor sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner is coming.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thou shalt be judged too, for one that hath hated the <hi>Father,</hi> by whose powerful drawing, this sinner doth come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Thou shalt be taken, and judged for one that has done despite to the Spirit of Grace, in him, that is by its help, coming to Jesus Christ. What sayst thou now? Wilt thou stand by thy doings, wilt thou continue to contemn, and reproach the living God? Thinkest thou, that thou shalt weather it out well enough, at the day of Judgement. <hi>Can thy heart indure, or can thine hands be strong in the day, that I shall deal with thee, saith the Lord.</hi> Joh. 15. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26. Jude 14. 14, 15. 1 Thes. 4. 8. Ezek. 22. 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Is it so? <hi>That no man comes to Jesus Christ by the will, Wisdome and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of man, but by the gift, promise, and drawing of the Father:</hi> Then this sheweth us, how it comes to pass, that weak means is so powerful as to bring men out of their sins, to a hearty pursute af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Jesus Christ: When God bid <hi>Moses</hi> speak to the people, he said, <hi>I will</hi>
                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:47254:93"/>
                  <hi>speak with thee,</hi> Exod. 19. When God speaks, when God works, Who can let it? None, none. Then the work goes on. <hi>Elias threw his Mantle upon the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of</hi> Elisha: and what a wonderful work followed. When Jesus fell in with the crowing of a Cock, what work was there! O when God is in the Means, then shall that Means, (be it never so weak, and contemptible in it self) work wonders, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19. 19. <hi>Matt.</hi> 26. 74, 75. <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. 71, 72. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 60, 61, 62.</p>
               <p>The World understand not, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the walls of <hi>Jerico</hi> shall fall at the Sound of Rams Horns; but when God will Work, the means must be effectual. A word weakly spoken, spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with difficulty, in Temptation, and in the midst of great contempt and scorn, works Wonders; <hi>If the Lord thy God will say so too.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Is it so? <hi>doth no Man come to Jesus Christ, by the Will, Wisdom, or Power of Man; but by the Gift, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, and Drawing of the Father:</hi> Then here is room for Christians to stand and admire, to stand and wonder, at the effectual working of Gods Providences, that he hath made use of, as means to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:47254:94"/>
bring them to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>For although Men are drawn to Christ by the Power of the Father: yet that Power putteth forth it self in the use of means; and that means, is Divers; somtimes this, somtimes that: for God is at liberty to work, by which, and when, and how he will; but let the means be what it will, and as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible as may be; yet God that Commanded the Light to Shine out of Darkness, and that out of Weakness, can make Strong; can, nay, doth oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times make use of very unlikely means, to bring about the Conversion and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of his People. Therefore, you that are come to Christ, (and that by unlikely means,) stay your selves, and wonder; and wondering, magnifie all mighty Power, by the working of which, the Means hath bin made effectual to bring you to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>What was the providence, that God made use of, as a Means either more remote, or more near, to bring thee to Jesus Christ? Was it the Removing of thy Habitation, the change of thy Condition, the Loss of Relations, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, or the like? was it thy casting of thine Eye upon some good Book, thy
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:47254:94"/>
hearing of thy Neighbours talk of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Things, the beholding of Gods Judgments, as executed upon others, or thine own Deliverance from them; or thy being strangly cast under the Ministry of some Godly Man? O take notice of such providence, or provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences! They were sent and managed by mighty Power, to do thee good. God himself, I say, hath Joyned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self unto this Chariot: Yea, and so blessed it, that it failed not to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish the thing for which he sent it.</p>
               <p>God blesseth not every one his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences in this manner: How many Thousands are there in this world, that pass every day under the same Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences? but God is not in them, to do that work by them, as he hath done for thy poor Soul, by his effectual working with them. O! That Jesus Christ should meet thee in this Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that Dispensation, or the other Ordinance! This is Grace indeed! At this, therefore, it will be thy Wisdom to admire, and for this to bless God.</p>
               <p>Give me leave, to give you a tast of some of those Providences, that have been effectual, through the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, to bring Salvation to the Souls of his People.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:47254:95"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The first shall be, That of the <hi>Woman</hi> of <hi>Samaria.</hi> It must happen, that she must needs go out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to draw Water (not before, nor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but) just when Jesus Christ her Saviour was come from far, and set to rest him (being weary) upon the Well: What a blessed Providence was this? Even a Providence Managed by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Wisdom, and Almighty Power, to the Conversion and Salvation of this poor Creature. For by this Providence, was this Poor Creature, and her Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, brought together; that that bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Work might be fulfilled upon the Woman, according to the purpose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determined by the Father, <hi>Joh</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> What a Providence was it, that there should between a <hi>Tree</hi> in the way, for <hi>Zachus</hi> to climb, thereby to give Jesus an opportunity to call that, Chief of the <hi>Publicans,</hi> home to himself, even before he came down there-from? <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> was it not also wonderfull, that the <hi>Thief,</hi> which you read of in the Gospel, should by the providence of God be cast into prison, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, even at that Sessions that Christ himself was to die; Nay, and that it
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:47254:95"/>
should happen too, that they must be hanged together, that the Thief might be in hearing and observing of Jesus in his last words, that he might be converted by him before his death? <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> What a strang providence was it, and as strangly managed by God, that <hi>Onesimus,</hi> when he was run away from his Master, should be taken, and, as I think, cast into that very prison, where <hi>Paul</hi> lay bound for the word of the Gospel; that he might there be by him converted, and then sent home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to his Master, Philem. <hi>Behold, all things work together for Good; to them that love God; to them,</hi> who are the called according to his purpose, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Nay, I have, my self, known some that have been made to go to hear the Word preached, against their wills: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have gone, not to hear; but to see, and be seen; nay, to jear and flout others; again, to catch and carp at things. Some also to feed their adulterous eyes, with the sight of beautifull Objects, and yet God hath made use, even of these things, even of the wicked, and sinfull proposals of sinners, to bring them under <hi>that</hi> grace, that might save their souls.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:47254:96"/>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Doth no man come to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, <hi>but by the drawing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of the Father?</hi> then let me here caution those poor sinners, that are spectators of the change, that God hath wrought in them that are coming to Jesus Christ, not to attribute <hi>this</hi> work and change, to other things and causes.</p>
               <p>There are some poor sinners in the VVorld, that plainly see a change, a mighty change in their Neighbors, and Relations, that are coming to Jesus Christ: But as I said, they being ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and not knowing whence it comes, and whither it goes (<hi>For so is every one that is Born of the Spirit,</hi> John, 3. 8.)</p>
               <p>Therefore, they Attribute this Change to other Causes; as,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. To Melancholy.</item>
                  <item>2. To sitting alone.</item>
                  <item>3. To overmuch Reading.</item>
                  <item>4. To their going to too many Sermons.</item>
                  <item>5. To too much studying, and musing on what they hear.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Also, they conclude on the other side;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That it is for want of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry company.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> For want of Physick, and
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:47254:96"/>
therefore they advise them to leave off Reading, going to Sermons, the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of sober People, and to be merry, to go a Gossipping, to busie themselves in the things of this VVorld, not to sit musing alone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But come poor ignorant sinner, let me deal with thee, it seemes thou art turned <hi>Counsellor for Satan:</hi> I tell thee, thou knowest not what thou dost. Take heed of spending thy judgment after this manner; thou judgest foolishly, <hi>And saist in this, to every one that passeth by, that thou art a Fool.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>VVhat! count Convictions for sin, mournings for sin, and Repentance for sin, Melancholy! This is like those that on the otherside, said, <hi>These men are Drunk with new Wine,</hi> &amp;c. as he that said, <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>
                     <hi>Mad,</hi> Acts</hi> 2. 13. <hi>chap.</hi> 26. 24.</p>
               <p>Poor ignorant sinner, canst thou judge better. VVhat! Is sitting alone, pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive under Gods Hand; Reading the Scriptures, and hearing of Sermons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the way to be undone! The Lord open thine Eyes, and make thee to see thine Error: Thou hast set thy self against God, thou hast despised the Operation of his Hands, thou at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptest
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:47254:97"/>
to Murther Souls. VVhat! canst thou give no better Counsel touching those whom God hath VVoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, than to send them to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Hell for help; thou biddest them be merry and lightsome: but dost thou not know that <hi>The heart of Fools is in the House of Laughter,</hi> Eccles. 7. 4. Thou bidest them shun the hearing of Thundring Preachers; <hi>But is it not better to hear the Rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the Song of Fools.</hi> verse 5. Thou bidst them busy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the things of this VVorld: but dost thou not know that the Lord bids, <hi>First seek the Kingdom of God, and the Righteousness thereof?</hi> Matt. 6. 36.</p>
               <p>Poor ignorant sinner, hear the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of God to such, and learn, thy self, to be wiser. <hi>If any be afflicted, let him Pray, is any merry let him sing Psalms. Blessed is he that heareth me, and hear for time to come: Save your selves from this untoward Generation; search the Scripture, give attendance to Reading. It is better to go to the House of Mourning, than to the House of Feasting,</hi> Jam. 5. 13. Prov. 8. 32, 33. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 40. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 39. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 13. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 7. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="189" facs="tcp:47254:97"/>And wilt thou judg him that doth thus, art thou almost like <hi>Elemas</hi> the Sorcerer, that sought to turn the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty from the Faith, thou seekest to pervert the right ways of the Lord; take heed, lest some heavy judgment overtake thee, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p>What! Teach men to quench con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions; take men off from a serious consideration of the evil of sin, of the Terrors of the world to come, and of how they shall escape the same! VVhat! Teach men to put God and his VVord out of their minds by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to merry Company, by running to the VVorld, by Gossipping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is as much as to bid them say to God, <hi>Depart from us, for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways; Or, what's the Almighty that we should serve Him! Or, what profit have we, if we keep his Ways?</hi> Here's a Devil in Grain! What: bid men walk according to the course of this world, according to the <hi>Prince of the Power of the Air, the Spirit that now worketh in the Children of Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> Ephes. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But we do not know, that such are comming to Jesus Christ, truly we

wonder at them, and think they are Fools.</p>
               <p>Answ. <hi>First,</hi> Do you not know that they are coming to Jesus Christ? then they may be coming to him for ought you know, and why will you be worse than the Brute, <hi>to speak evil of the things ye know not?</hi> What! are ye made to be taken and destroyed, must ye utterly Perish in your own Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Do you not know them? let them alone then. If you cannot speak good of them, speak not bad. <hi>Refrain from these Men, and let them alone; for if this Council, or this Work, be of men, it will come to nought; but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it, lest haply ye be found, even to fight against God.</hi> Acts 5. 38 39.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> But why do you wonder at a work of Conviction, and Conversion; know you not, that this is the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God upon you, ye despisers? <hi>To behold, and wonder, and perish.</hi> Acts. 13. 40, 41.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> But why wonder, and think they are Fools? Is the way of the just an abomination to you, see that passage and be ashamed, <hi>He that is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:47254:98"/>
                  <hi>in the way is an Abomination to the wicked,</hi> Pro. 29. 27.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Your wondring at them, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, that you are strangers to your selves, to conviction for sin, and to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty desires to be saved: as also to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But how shall we know, that such men are coming to Jesus Christ?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Who can make them see that Christ has made blind! (<hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 39.) Nevertheless, because I endeavor thy Conviction, Conversion, and Salvation, Consider,</p>
               <p>1. Do they cry out of Sin, being burdened with it, as of an exceeding bitter thing?</p>
               <p>2. Do they fly from it, as from the Face of a deadly Serpent?</p>
               <p>3. Do they Cry out of the insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of their own Righteousness, as to justification in the sight of God?</p>
               <p>4. Do they Cry out after the Lord Jesus, to save them?</p>
               <p>5. Do they see more Worth, and Merit, in one drop of Christs Blood to save them, than in all the sins of the VVorld to Damn them?</p>
               <p>6. Are they tender of sinning against Jesus Christ?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:47254:99"/>7. Is his Name, Person, and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, more precious to them, than is the Glory of all the VVorld?</p>
               <p>8. Is his VVord most Dear unto them?</p>
               <p>9. Is Faith in Christ, (of which they are convinced by Gods Spirit, of the want of; and that without it, they can never close with Christ;) Precious to them?</p>
               <p>10. Do they savor Christ in his VVord, and do they leave all the VVorld for his Sake; and are they willing (God helping them) to run all hazzards, for his Name, for the love they bear to him?</p>
               <p>11. Are his Saints precious to them?</p>
               <p>If these things be so, whether thou seest them or no, these men are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Jesus Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Psal.</hi> 38. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18, 19, 20. <hi>Isa.</hi> 64. 6. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 7, 8. <hi>Psal.</hi> 54. 1. <hi>Psal.</hi> 109. 26. <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 30. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 7, 8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18, 19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Acts.</hi> 5. 41. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 7, 8. <hi>Song.</hi> 5. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 35. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>chap.</hi> 3. 14. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6. <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 10, 11. <hi>Jer.</hi> 15. 16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 24, 25, 26, 27. <hi>Acts.</hi> 20. 22, 23, 24.

                  <hi>The Second Observation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I come now to the Second Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion propounded to be spoken to; to witt,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That they that are coming to Jesus Christ are oft-times heartily afraid, that Jesus Christ will not receive them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I told you, that this Observation is implyed in the Text, and I gather it from the largeness, and openness of the Promise [<hi>I will in no wise cast out</hi>]. For had there not been a prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in us <hi>to fear Casting out,</hi> Christ needed not to have, as it were, way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid our fear, as he doth, by this great and strange Expression, <hi>In no wise;</hi> [<hi>And him that Cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi>] There needed not, as I may say, such a Promise, be invented by the VVisdom of Heaven, VVorded at such a Rate, as it were, on purpose to dash in peeces at one blow, all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of Coming Sinners; if they were not prone to admit of such Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, to the discouraging of their own Souls. For this VVord, <hi>in no wise;</hi>
                  <pb n="194" facs="tcp:47254:100"/>
cutteth the Throat of all Objections; and it was dropt by the Lord Jesus, for that very end; and to help the Faith that is mixed with Unbelief.</p>
               <p>And it is as it were, the sum of all Promises: neither can any Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be made, upon the unworthyness that thou findest in thee, that this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise will not asoile.</p>
               <p>But I am a great sinner, sayst thou.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will in no wise cast out,</hi> sayes Christ.</p>
               <p>But I am an old sinner, sayst thou.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will in no wise cast out,</hi> sayes Christ.</p>
               <p>But I am a hard hearted sinner, sayst thou.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will in no wise cast out,</hi> sayes Christ.</p>
               <p>But I am a back-sliding sinner, sayst thou.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will in no wise cast out,</hi> sayes Christ.</p>
               <p>But I have served Satan all my dayes, sayst thou.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will in no wise cast out,</hi> sayes Christ.</p>
               <p>But I have sinned against Light, sayst thou.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will in no wise cast out,</hi> sayes Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:47254:100"/>But I have sinned against mercy, sayst thou.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will in no wise cast out,</hi> sayes Christ.</p>
               <p>But I have no good thing to bring with me, say'st thou:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I will in no wise cast out,</hi> sayes Christ.</p>
               <p>Thus I might go on, to the end of things, and shew you, that still this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise was provided to answer Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; And doth answer them: But I say, what need it be, if they that are coming to Jesus Christ, are not sometimes, yea oft-times, heartily afraid, <hi>that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, will cast them out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will give you, now, two instances, that seem to imply the truth of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</p>
               <p>In the Nineth of <hi>Matthew,</hi> at the Second <hi>Verse,</hi> you read of a man, that was sick of the Palsie; and he was coming to Jesus Christ, being born up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a bed by his Friends: He also was coming himself, and that upon another account than any of his friends was aware of; even for the pardon of sins, and the Salvation of his Soul. Now so soon as ever he was come into the presence of Christ, Christ bids him
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:47254:101"/>
                  <hi>be of good chear;</hi> it seems then, his heart was fainting, but what was the cause of this fainting, but the guilt, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of his sins; therefore he proceeds, <hi>Be of good chear, thy sins are forgiven thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I say, Christ saw him sinking in his mind, about how it would go with his most Noble part; and therefore, first, he applies himself to him, upon that account. For though his friends, had Faith enough as to the cure of the Body, yet he himself had little enough as to the Cure of his Soul: Therefore, Christ takes him up as a man falling down, saying, <hi>Son, be of good Cheer, thy Sins are forgiven thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That about the Prodigal, seemes pertinent also to this matter; <hi>When he was come to himself, he said, how many hired Servants of my Father have Bred enough, and to spare, and I perish for Hunger. I will arise now and go to my Father.</hi> Heartily spoken. But how did he perform his Promise? I think, not so well as he promised to do: And my ground for my Thoughts is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his Father, so soon as he was come at him, fell upon his Neck and Kist him: Implying methinks, as if the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:47254:101"/>
Prodegal by this time was dejected in his mind; and therefore, his Father gives him the most sudden and familiar token of Reconciliation.</p>
               <p>And Kisses were of old time often used to remove Doubts and Fears. Thus <hi>Laban,</hi> and <hi>Esau, Kiss Jacob.</hi> Thus <hi>Joseph, Kissed his Brethren,</hi> and thus also <hi>David, Kissed Absolom, Gen.</hi> 31. 55. <hi>chap.</hi> 33. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>chap.</hi> 48. 9, 10. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. 33.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, as I said, at first setting out, he spake heartily, as sometimes Sinners also do in their beginning to come to Jesus Christ: But might not he, yea, in all probability he had, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the first step he took, and the last, by which he accomplished that journey) many a thought, both this way, and that; as whether his Father would receive him, or no? As thus; I said, <hi>I would go to my Father:</hi> but how, if when I come at him, he should ask me, <hi>Where I have all this while bin;</hi> VVhat must I say then? Also, if he asks me, <hi>What is become of the portion of Goods that he gave me;</hi> VVhat shall I say then? If he asks me, <hi>Who have bin my Companions;</hi> VVhat shall I say then? If he also shall ask me, <hi>What</hi>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:47254:102"/>
                  <hi>hath bin my Preferment in all the time of mine absence from him;</hi> VVhat shall I say then? Yea, and if he ask me, <hi>Why I came home no sooner;</hi> What shall I say then? Thus, I say, might he reason with himself; And being Conscious to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that he could give but a bad An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to any of these Interogatories; no marvel, if he stood in need first of all, <hi>of a Kiss</hi> from his Fathers Lips. For, had he answered the first, in Truth he must say, <hi>I have bin a haunter of Taverns, and Alehouses;</hi> and as for my Portion, <hi>I spent it in Riotous Living;</hi> my Companions, <hi>were Whores, and Drabs:</hi> As for my preferment, the highest was, <hi>that I became a Hoggard:</hi> and as for my not coming home till now, <hi>Could I have made shift to have staid abroad any longer, I had not lain at thy Feet for Mercy now.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I say, these things considered, and considering again, how prone poor man is, to give way, when truly awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to despondings, and heart-misgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; no marvel if he sink in his mind, between the time of his first setting out, and that of his coming to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>3. But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> methinks I have for the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:47254:102"/>
confirmation of this Truth, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of all the Saints that are under Heaven, to witt, <hi>That they that are Coming to Jesus Christ, are oft-times heartily afraid that he will not receive them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But what should be the Reason?</p>
               <p>I will Answer to this Question thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It is not for want of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed VVill of God, that manifesteth grounds for the Contrary, for that there is a sufficiency of; yea, the Text it self, hath laid a sufficient Foundation, for incouragement, for them that are Coming to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And him that Cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is not for want of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation to Come, for that is full, and plain, <hi>Come unto me, all ye that Labor, and are heavy Laden, and I will give you Rest,</hi> Mat. 11. 28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Neither is it, for want of a manifestation of Christs willingness to receive, as those Texts above named, with that which follows, declareth. <hi>If any man Thirst, let him come unto me and drink,</hi> Joh. 7. 37.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:47254:103"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is not for want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great and precious Promises, to receive them that Come. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you, and I will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my Sons and Daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17, 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It is not for want of Solemn Oath, and Ingagement, to save them that come: <hi>For, because he could swear by no Greater, he swore by Himself;—That by Two Immutable Things, in which it was impossible that God should Lie, we might have a strong Consolation, who have fled for Refuge, to lay hold on the Hope set before us,</hi> Heb. 6. 15, 16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Neither is it for want of great Examples of God's Mercy, that have come to Jesus Christ, of which we Read most plentifully in the Word.</p>
               <p>Therefore, it must be concluded, It is for want of that which follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, It is for want of the Knowledge of Christ:</hi> Thou knowest but little of the Grace and Kindness that is in the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:47254:103"/>
Heart of Christ: Thou knowest but little of the Vertue and Merit of his Blood: Thou knowest but little of the Willingness, that is in his Heart to save thee; And this is the reason of the Fear that ariseth in thy Heart, and that causeth thee to doubt, that Christ will not receive thee. Unbelief is the Daughter of Ignorance: Therefore, Christ saith; <hi>O Fools, and slow of Heart to Believe,</hi> Luk. 24. 25.</p>
               <p>Slowness of Heart to believe, flows from thy Foolishness in the Things of Christ: This is evident to all that are acquainted with themselves, and that are seeking after Jesus Christ: The more Ignorance, the more Unbelief; the more Knowledge of Christ, the more Faith. <hi>They that know thy Name, will put their Trust in thee,</hi> Psal. 9. 10. He therefore, that began to come to Christ but the other day, and hath yet but little Knowledge of him, he fears that Christ will not receive him: But he that hath been longer acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him, he is <hi>Strong, and hath over-come the Wicked One,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.</p>
               <p>VVhen <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Brethren came into <hi>Egypt</hi> to buy Corn, it is said; Joseph <hi>knew his Brethren, but his Brethren knew</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:47254:104"/>
                  <hi>not him.</hi> What follows? Why, great Mistrust of Heart about their speeding well; specially, if <hi>Joseph</hi> did but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer them Roughly; calling them <hi>Spies,</hi> and questioning their <hi>Truth,</hi> and the like. And observe it; So long as their Ignorance about their Brother remained with them, whatsoever <hi>Joseph</hi> did, still they put the worst Sense upon it: For instance; <hi>Joseph</hi> upon a time, bids the Steward of his House bring them Home, to Dine with him, to Dine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in <hi>Joseph</hi>'s House: And how is this resented by them? Why, they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid: <hi>And the men were afraid, because they were brought into</hi> (their Brother) Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph's <hi>House.</hi> And they said, <hi>He seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth occasion against us, and will fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and take us for Bond-men, and our Asses,</hi> Gen. 42. Chap. 43. What! Afraid to go to <hi>Joseph</hi>'s House? He was their <hi>Brother;</hi> He intended to Feast <hi>them;</hi> to <hi>Feast</hi> them, and Feast with them. Ah! but they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, <hi>That he was their Brother:</hi> And so long as their Ignorance lasted, so long their Fear terrifyed them. Just thus it is with the Sinner, that but of late is coming to Jesus Christ: He is ignorant of the Love and Pity that is
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:47254:104"/>
in Christ to Coming-Sinners: Therefore he doubts, therefore he fears, therefore his Heart mis-gives him.</p>
               <p>Coming-Sinner, Christ inviteth thee to Dine and Sup with him: He invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth thee to a Banquet of Wine; yea, to come into his Wine-Cellar, and his Banner over thee shall be Love, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>Song</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. But I doubt it, sayes the Sinner: But 'tis answer'd; He calls thee, invites thee to his Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, to his Flaggons, Apples; to his Wine, and to the Juyce of his Pomgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. O I fear, I doubt, I mistrust! I tremble in Expectation of the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry! <hi>Come out of the Man, thou Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stardly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ignorance!</hi> Be not afraid Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, only Believe: <hi>He that cometh to Christ, he will in no wise cast out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let the Coming - Sinner therefore seek after more of the good Knowledge of Jesus Christ: Press after it; Seek it as Silver; and dig for it, as for hid Knowledge. This will embolden thee: This will make thee wax Stronger and Stronger. <hi>I know, whom I have Believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I know him,</hi> said <hi>Paul:</hi> And what follows? Why, <hi>And I am perswaded, that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him, against that Day,</hi> 2 Tim.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:47254:105"/>What had <hi>Paul</hi> committed to Jesus Christ? The Answer is, He had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him <hi>his Soul.</hi> But why did he Commit his Soul to him? Why, because he <hi>knew</hi> him: He <hi>knew</hi> him to be Faithful, to be Kind: He <hi>knew,</hi> he would not fail him, nor forsake him; And therefore, he laid his Soul down at his Feet; and committed it to him, to keep against that Day. But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Thy Fears, that Christ will not receive thee, may be also a <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi> of thy earnest, and strong Desires after thy Salvation by him. For this I observe; That strong <hi>Desires</hi> to <hi>have,</hi> are attended with strong <hi>Fears</hi> of <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</hi> What a Man most sets his Heart upon, and what his Desires are most after, he (oft-times) most fears, he shall not obtain. So the Man, the Ruler of the Synagogue, had a great desire, that his Daughter should live; and that Desire was attended with Fear, that she should not: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Christ saith unto him, <hi>Be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid,</hi> Mark 5. 36.</p>
               <p>Suppose a Young Man should have his Heart much set upon a Virgin, to have her to Wife: If ever he Fears he shall not Obtain, it is when he begins
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:47254:105"/>
to love; now, thinks he, some body will step in betwixt my Love, and the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it; either they will find Fault with my Person, my Estate, my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, or somthing.</p>
               <p>Now thoughts begin to work, she doth not like me, or something. And thus it is with the Soul at first Coming to Jesus Christ; thou lovest him, and thy love produceth Jealousy, and that Jealousy, oft-times, beget Fears.</p>
               <p>Now thou fearest the Sins of thy Youth, the Sins of thine old Age, the Sins of thy Calling, the Sins of thy Christian Duties, the Sins of thy Heart, or somthing: thou thinkest somthing or other will alienate the Heart and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Jesus Christ from thee; thou thinkest he sees somthing in thee, for the sake of which he will refuse thy Soul.</p>
               <p>But be content, a little more Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him, will make thee take bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter heart, thy earnest desires shall not be attended with such burning Fears: Thou shalt hereafter say, <hi>This is mine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity.</hi> (Psal. 77.)</p>
               <p>Thou art <hi>Sick of Love;</hi> a very sweet Disease, and yet every Disease has some weakness attending of it; yet I
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:47254:106"/>
wish this Distemper (if it be lawful to call it so) was more Epidemical. Dye of this Disease, I would gladly do; 'tis better than Life it self, though it be attended with Fears. But thou cryest, <hi>I cannot obtain:</hi> Well, be not too hasty in making Conclusions: If Jesus Christ had not put his Finger in at the Hole of the Lock, thy Bowels would not have been troubled for him, (<hi>Song</hi> 5.) Mark how the Prophet hath it: <hi>They shall walk after the Lord; he shall Roar like a Lyon: When he shall Roar, the Children shall Tremble from the</hi> East: <hi>They shall Tremble like a Bird out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and as a Dove out of the Land of</hi> Assyria, Hos. 11. 10, 11.</p>
               <p>When God <hi>Roars,</hi> (as oft-times the Coming Soul hears him Roar) what Man, that is coming, can do otherwise than Tremble? (<hi>Amos</hi> 3. 8.) But Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling he comes: <hi>He sprang in, and came Trembling, and fell down before</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Silas, Act. 16.</p>
               <p>Should you ask him that we mentioned but now; How long is it, since you began to fear you should miss of this Damosel you Love so? The Answer would be; Ever since I began to Love her: But did you not fear it before?
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:47254:106"/>
No; nor should I fear it now, but that I vehemently Love her. Come Sinner, let us apply it: How long is it since thou begannest to Fear, that Jesus Christ will not Receive thee? Thy Answer is; Ever since I began to desire, that he would save my Soul. I began to Fear, when I began to Come: And the more my Heart burns in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires after him, the more I feel my Heart fear, I shall not be Saved by him.</p>
               <p>See now; Did not I tell thee, That thy Fears were but the Consequence of strong Desires? Well, fear not, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Sinner; Thousands of Coming-Souls are in thy Condition, and yet they will also get safe into Christ's Bosom. <hi>Say</hi> (sayes Christ) <hi>to them that are of a fearful Heart, Be strong, fear not;—Your God will come and Save you,</hi> Isa. 35. 4. Chap. 63<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Thy Fear that Christ will not Receive thee, <hi>May arise from a Sense of thine own Unworthyness.</hi> Thou seest what a poor, sorry, wretched, worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Creature thou art; And seeing this, thou fearest Christ will not Receive thee. <hi>Alas,</hi> say'st thou, <hi>I am the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest of all Men; a Town-Sinner, a Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leading</hi>
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:47254:107"/>
                  <hi>Sinner! I am not only a Sinner my self, but have made others two-fold worse the Children of Hell also. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, Now I am under some Awakenings, and Stirrings of Mind after Salvation; even now I find my heart Rebellious, Carnal, Hard, Treacherous, Desperate, prone to Unbelief, to Despair: It forgetteth the Word; it wandreth, it runneth to the Ends of the Earth. There is not (I am perswaded) one in all the World, that hath such a desperate wicked Heart, as mine is: My Soul is careless to do Good; but none more earnest to do that which is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Can such an one as I am, Live in Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Can an Holy, a Just, and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God, once think (with Honour to his Name) of Saving such a Vile Creature as I am? I fear it. Will he shew Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to such a dead Dog as I am? I doubt it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am cast out, to the loathing of my Person; yea, I loath my self: I stink in mine own Nostrils. How can I then be accepted by an Holy and Sin-abhorring God?</hi> (Psal. 38. 5, 6, 7. Ezek. 16. Chap. 20. 42, 43, 44.) <hi>Saved I would be; and, Who is there, that would not, were they in my Condition? Indeed, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:47254:107"/>
                  <hi>at the Madness and Folly of others, when I see them so Merry in their Chains; while I see them Leap and Skip so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly about the Mouth of Hell. Bold Sinner, How darest thou tempt God, by Laughing at the Breach of his Holy Law? But Alas! They are not so bad one way, but I am worse another: I wish, my Self were any Body but my Self: And yet here again, I know not what to wish. When I see such, as I believe, are coming to Jesus Christ; O I bless them! But am confounded in my self, to see how unlike (as I think) I am to every good Man in the World. They can Hear, Read, Pray, Remember, Repent; be Humble, and Do every thing better than so Vile a Wretch as I.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I, Vile Wretch, am good for nothing, but to burn in Hell-Fire; and when I think of that, I am confounded too.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Sense of Unworthyness, creates and heightens Fears in the Hearts of them that are coming to Jesus Christ; But indeed, it should not: For, who needs the Physitian, but the Sick? Or, who did Christ come into the World to Save, but the Chief of Sinners? (<hi>Mar.</hi> 1. 17. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15.) Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:47254:108"/>
the more thou feest thy Sins, the faster fly thou to Jesus Christ. And let the Sense of thy own Unworthyness, prevail with thee yet to go faster. As it is with the Man that carrieth his broken Arm in a Sling to the Bone-set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; still as he thinks of his broken Arm, and as he feels the Pain and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, he hastens his Pace to the Man: And if Satan meets thee, and asketh, Whether goest thou? Tell him, Thou art Maimed, and art going to the Lord Jesus. If he objects thine own Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness, Tell him; That even as the Sick seeketh the Physitian, and as he that hath broken Bones, seeks him that can Set them: So thou art going to Jesus Christ for Cure and Healing, for thy Sin-sick-Soul.</p>
               <p>But it oft times happeneth to the Coming-Soul, as it happeneth to him that flies for his Life; He despairs of Escaping, and therefore delivers up himself into the Hand of the Purfuer. But, up, up, Sinner; be of good chear, Christ came to Save the Unworthy Ones: Be not Faithless, but Believe. Come away Man; the Lord Jesus calls thee, saying; <hi>And him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="tcp:47254:108"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Thy Fear that Christ will not Receive thee, may arise from a Sense of the exceeding Mercy of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Saved. Sometime Salvation is in the Eyes of him that desires it, so great, so huge, so wonderful a thing, that the very Thoughts of the Excellency of it, ingenders Unbelief about obtaining it, in the Heart of those that unfeignedly desire it. <hi>Seemeth it to you</hi> (said <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>) <hi>a Light thing, to be a King's Son-in-Law,</hi> 1 Sam. 18. 23. So the Thoughts of the Greatness and Glory of the Thing propounded; as Heaven, Eternal Life, Eternal Glory, to be with God, and Christ, and Angels: These are great Things; Things too Good, (saith the Soul, that is little in his own Eyes:) Things too Rich, (saith the Soul, that is truly poor in Spirit) for me.</p>
               <p>Besides, the Holy Ghost hath a way to greaten Heavenly things, to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the coming sinner; yea, and at the same time to greaten too the sin, and unworthiness of that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Now the Soul staggeringly won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, saying; What! to be made like Angels, like Christ! To live in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal bliss, joy and felicity! This is for
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:47254:109"/>
Angels, and for them that can walk like Angels.</p>
               <p>If a <hi>Prince,</hi> a <hi>Duke,</hi> or <hi>Earl,</hi> should send (by the Hand of his Servant) to some poor, sorry, beggarly scrub, to take her for his Master, to wife; and the Servant should come and say, My Lord and Master, such an one, hath sent me to thee, to take thee to him to wife; he is rich, beautiful; and of excellent qualities; he is Loving, Meek, Humble, Well-spoken, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What now would this poor, sorry, beggarly Creature think? what would she say, or how would she frame an answer? When <hi>King David</hi> sent to <hi>Abigail</hi> upon this account, and though she was a rich woman, yet she said, <hi>Behold, Let thine hand maid be a Servant to wash the feet of the Servants of my Lord.</hi> (1 Sam. 25. 40, 41.) She was confounded, she could not well tell what to say, the offer was so great, beyond what could in reason be expected.</p>
               <p>But suppose this great person should Second his Sute, and send to this Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Creature again; What would she say now? Would she not say, <hi>you Mock me?</hi> But what if he affirms that he is in good earnest, and that his Lord <hi>must</hi>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:47254:109"/>
have her to wife; yea, suppose he should prevail upon her to Credit his Message, and to address her self for her Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney: Yet behold, every thought of her pedigree confounds her; also her sense of want of beauty, makes her ashamed: and if she doth but think of being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, the unbelief that is mixed with that thought, whirls her into tremblings: And now she calls her self fool for believing the Messenger, and thinks not to go: If she thinks of being bold, she Blushes, and the least thought that she shall be rejected, when she comes at him, makes her look as if she would give up the Ghost.</p>
               <p>And is it a wonder then, to see a Soul that is drowned with the sense of glory, and a sense of its own nothing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to be confounded in it self, and to fear that the glory apprehended, is too great, too good, and too rich for such an one.</p>
               <p>That thing, Heaven and Eternal Glory, is so great; and I that would have it, so small, so sorry a Creature, that the thoughts of obtaining, confounds me.</p>
               <p>Thus, I say, doth the greatness of the things desired, quite dash and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the mind of the desirer: O it is
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:47254:110"/>
too bigg, it is too big! It is too great a mercy.</p>
               <p>But coming sinner, let me reason with thee, Thou say'st it is too bigg, too great. Well, will things that are less, satisfie thy Soul? will a less thing than Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, than Glory, and Eternal life, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer thy desires? No, nothing less: yet I fear they are too big, and too good for me, ever to obtain. Well, as big, and as good as they are, God giveth them to such as thou; They are not too big for God to give. No, not too big to give freely: be content, let God give like Himself; he is that Eternal God, and he giveth like himself. When <hi>Kings</hi> give, they do not use to give as poor men do. Hence it is said, that <hi>Nabal</hi> made a feast in his house, <hi>Like the feast of a King:</hi> And again, <hi>All these things did</hi> Araunah, <hi>as a King, give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to David,</hi> 1 Sam. 25. 2 Sam. 24. Now God is a great King, let him give like a King; Nay, let him give like himself, and do thou receive like thy self: He hath all, and thou hast nothing. God told his people of old, that he would save them in truth, and in righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and that they should return to, and injoy the Land, which before, for
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:47254:110"/>
their sins, had spued them out: and then adds, under a supposition of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the mercy too good, or too big: <hi>If it be marvellous in the eyes of the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of this people in these days, should it also be Marvellous in mine eyes, saith the Lord of hosts,</hi> Zech. 8. 6.</p>
               <p>As who should say, they are now in Captivity, and little in their own eyes; therefore they think the mercy of return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Canaan,</hi> is a mercy too marvellous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly big for them to injoy; but if it be so in their eyes, it is not so in mine: I will do for them, <hi>like God,</hi> if they will but receive my bounty, <hi>like sinners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Coming sinner, God can give his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the glory of it unto thee; yea none ever had them, but as a <hi>gift,</hi> a <hi>free</hi> gift: He hath given us his Son, <hi>how shall he not then with him also freely give us all things?</hi> Rom 8.</p>
               <p>It was not the worthiness of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> or <hi>Moses,</hi> or <hi>David,</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Paul:</hi> But the mercy of God that made them inheritors of Heaven. If God thinks thee worthy, judge not thy self unworthy; but take it, and be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. And it is a good signe, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to give thee, if he hath drawn out thy heart to ask. <hi>O Lord, thou hast</hi>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:47254:111"/>
                  <hi>heard the desire of the humble, thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt encline thine car,</hi> (Psal. 10. 17.)</p>
               <p>When God is said to encline his ear, it implies an intention to bestow the mercy desired: Take it therefore, thy Wisdom will be to receive, not <hi>stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> at thine own unworthiness. It is said, <hi>He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among Princes, and to make them inherit the thrown of glory.</hi> Again, <hi>He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth some needy <hi>Out</hi> of the dunghill, that he may set him with Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, even with the Princes of his people.</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 8. Psal. 113. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>You see also, when God made a Wedding for his Son, he called not the great, nor the rich, nor the mighty, <hi>but the poor, the maimed, the halt, and the blind,</hi> (Mat. 22. Luk. 14.)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Thy fears that Christ will not receive thee, may arise from the hideous Roarings of the Devil, who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sues thee. He that hears him Roar, must be a mighty Christian, if he can, at that time, deliver himself from fear. He is called a Roaring Lyon, and then, to alude to that in Isaiah, <hi>if one look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:47254:111"/>
                  <hi>them, they have darkness and sorrow, and the Light is darkned in their very Heaven,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 8. Isa. 5. 30.</p>
               <p>There are two things, among many, that Satan useth to Roar <hi>Out,</hi> after them, that are coming to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>That they are not Elected.</hi> Or,</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>That they have sinned the sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Holy Ghost.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>To both these I answer briefly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Touching election, out of which thou fearest thou art excluded: Why coming sinner, even the Text it self affordeth thee help against this doubt, and that by a double argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That coming to Christ, is by vertue of the gift, promise, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Father; but thou art a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, therefore God hath given thee, promised thee, and is drawing thee to Jesus Christ. Coming sinner, hold to this: and when Satan beginneth to Roar again, Answer: but I feel my heart moving after Jesus Christ; but that would not be, if I were not given by promise, and drawing, to Christ by the power of the Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Jesus Christ hath promised, that <hi>him that cometh to Him, he will in no wise cast out:</hi> And if he hath said it,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:47254:112"/>
will he not make it good; I mean, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thy Salvation? for, as I have said already; <hi>Not to cast out,</hi> is to receive, and admit to the benefit of Salvation: if then the Father hath given thee, as is manifest by thy coming; and if Christ will receive thee, thou coming Soul; as 'tis plain he will, because he hath said, <hi>he will in no wise cast thee out:</hi> Then be confident, and let those con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions, that as naturally flow from the Text, as light from the Sun, or water from the fountain, stay thee.</p>
               <p>If Satan therefore objecteth, <hi>but thou art not elected;</hi> Answer. But I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Satan, I am coming; and that I could not be, but that the Father draws me; and I am coming to such a Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, as <hi>will in no wise cast me out.</hi> Further, Satan, were I not elect, the Father would not draw me, nor would the Son so graciously open his bosom to me. I am perswaded, that not one of the non-elect, shall ever be able to say (no, not in the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) I did sincerely come to Jesus Christ. Come they may feignedly, as <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Magnus</hi> did; But that is not our question: Therefore, O thou
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:47254:112"/>
honest-hearted coming sinner, be not afraid, but come!</p>
               <p>As to the Second part of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, about sinning the sin against the Holy Ghost: The same argument over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws that also. But I will argue thus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Coming to Christ, is by vertue of a special gift of the Father; but the Father giveth no such gift to them that have sinned that sin; therefore thou that art coming, hast not committed that sin. That the Father giveth no such gift to them that has sinned this sin; Is evident,</p>
               <p>1. Because such have sinned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves out of God's Favour, <hi>They shall never have Forgiveness,</hi> Matth. 12. 32. But it is a special Favour of God to give unto a Man, to come to Jesus Christ; because thereby he obtaineth Forgiveness: Therefore, he that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, hath not sinned that Sin.</p>
               <p>2. They that have sinned the Sin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Holy-Ghost, have sinned themselves out of an Interest in the Sacrifice of Christ's Body and Blood; <hi>There remains for such, no more Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for Sin:</hi> But God giveth not Grace to any of them to come to Christ, that have no share in the Sacrifice of his Body and Blood: Therefore, thou
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:47254:113"/>
that art coming to him, hast not sinned that Sin; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Coming to Christ, is by the Special Drawing of the Father: <hi>No Man cometh to me, except the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which hath sent me, draw him:</hi> But the Father draweth not him to Christ, for whom he hath not alotted Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness by his Blood. Therefore, they that are coming to Jesus Christ, have not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that Sin; because he hath alotted them Forgiveness by his Blood, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 44.</p>
               <p>That the Father cannot draw them to Jesus Christ, for whom he hath not alotted Forgiveness of Sins, is manifest to Sense: For that would be a plain Moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kery, a Flam; neither becoming his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Justice, Holyness, nor Goodness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Coming to Jesus Christ, lays a Man under the Promise of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness, and Salvation: But it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible, that he that hath sinned that Sin, should ever be put under a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of these. Therefore, he that hath sinned that Sin, can never have Heart to come to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Coming to Jesus Christ, lays a Man under his Intercession; <hi>For he ever Liveth to make Intercession for them that come,</hi> Heb. 7. 25. Therefore,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:47254:113"/>
he that is coming to Jesus Christ, cannot have sinned that Sin.</p>
               <p>Christ has forbidden his People, to pray for them that have sinned that Sin; and therefore, will not pray for them himself: But he prays for them that come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> He that hath sinned that Sin, Christ is to him of no more Worth, than is a Man that is Dead; <hi>For he hath Crucified to himself, the Son of God:</hi> Yea, and hath also counted his Precious Blood, as the Blood of an Unholy Thing; <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. <hi>chap.</hi> 10. Now, he that hath this low Esteem of Christ, will never come to him for Life: But the Coming-Man has an high Esteem of his Person, Blood, and Merits. Therefore, he that is coming, has not Committed that Sin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> If he that hath sinned this Sin, might yet come to Jesus Christ; then must the Truth of God be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown: which saith in one Place; <hi>He hath never Forgiveness:</hi> and in another, <hi>I will in no wise cast him out:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that he may never have Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, he shall never have Heart to come to Jesus Christ. <hi>It is impossible, that such an one should be Renewed, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:47254:114"/>
                  <hi>to, or by Repentance,</hi> Heb. 6. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, never trouble thy Head, nor Heart, about this Matter: He that cometh to Jesus Christ, cannot have sinned against the Holy Ghost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Thy Fears that Christ will not Receive thee, <hi>may arise from thine own Folly, in Inventing; yea, in thy Chalking out to God a way to bring thee Home to Jesus Christ.</hi> Some Souls that are coming to Jesus Christ, are great Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors of themselves upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: They conclude, that if their Coming to Jesus Christ is right, they must needs be brought Home thus and thus: As to instance;</p>
               <p>1. Sayes one, If God be bringing of me to Jesus Christ, then will he load me with the Guilt of Sin, till he makes me Roar again.</p>
               <p>2. If God be indeed a bringing of me home to Jesus Christ, then must I be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted with dreadful Temptations of the Devil.</p>
               <p>3. If God be indeed a bringing of me to Jesus Christ; then even when I come at him, I shall have wonderful Revelations of him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:47254:114"/>This is the way that some Sinners appoint for God: But, perhaps, he will not walk therein; yet will he bring them to Jesus Christ: But now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they come not the Way of their own Chalking out, therefore they are at a loss. They look for Heavy Load and Burden; but, perhaps, God gives them a Sight of their lost Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and addeth not that heavy Weight and Burden. They look for fearful Temptations of Satan; but God sees, that yet they are not fit for them: Nor is the Time come, that he should be Honoured by them in such à Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. They look for great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Revelations, of Christ, Grace and Mercy: But perhaps, God only takes the Yoke from off their Jaws, and lays Meat before them. And now again, they are at a loss, yet a-coming to Jesus Christ: <hi>I drew them</hi> (saith God) <hi>with the Cords of a Man, with the Bands of Love: I took the Yoke from off their Jaws, and laid Meat unto them,</hi> Hos. 11. 4.</p>
               <p>Now, I say, if God brings thee to Christ, and not by the Way that thou hast appointed, then thou art at a loss; and for thy being at a loss, <hi>Thou mayst</hi>
                  <pb n="224" facs="tcp:47254:115"/>
                  <hi>thank thy self.</hi> God hath more ways than thou knowst of, to bring a Sinner to Jesus Christ: But he will not give thee before-hand an Account, by which of them he will bring thee to Christ; <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 13. <hi>Job</hi> 33. 13.</p>
               <p>Sometimes, he hath his Way <hi>in the Whirlwind;</hi> but sometimes <hi>the Lord is not there,</hi> Nah. 13. 1 King. 19. 11.</p>
               <p>If God will deal more gently with thee, than with others of his Children, grudge not at it: Refuse not the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that go softly, lest he bring upon thee the Waters of the Rivers, strong and many; even these two smoaking Fire-brands, the <hi>Devil,</hi> and <hi>Guilt</hi> of Sin; <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. 6, 7. He said to <hi>Peter, Follow me:</hi> And what Thunder did <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> hear or see? Zacheus, <hi>come down,</hi> said Christ; <hi>and he came down</hi> (sayes <hi>Luke</hi>) <hi>and Received him Joyfully.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But had <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Zacheus,</hi> made the Objection that thou hast made; and <hi>Directed the Spirit of the Lord, as thou hast done;</hi> they might have looked long enough, before they had found themselves coming to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Besides, I will tell thee; That the greatness of Sense of Sin, the hideous Roarings of the Devil, yea, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:47254:115"/>
of Revelations, will not prove that God is bringing the Soul to Jesus Christ: As <hi>Balaam, Cain, Judas,</hi> and others can witness.</p>
               <p>Further; Consider, that what thou hast not of these things <hi>now,</hi> thou mayst have <hi>another</hi> time, and that to thy Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction: Wherefore, instead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discontent, because thou art not in the Fire, because thou hearest not the Sound of the Trumpet, and Alarum of War; <hi>Pray, that thou enter not into Temptation:</hi> Yea, come boldly to the Throne of Grace, and obtain Mercy, and find Grace to help in that time of need; <hi>Psal.</hi> 88. 15. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. 40, 41. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 16.</p>
               <p>Poor Creature! Thou criest, If I were Tempted, I could come faster, and with more Confidence to Jesus Christ: Thou sayest thou knowst not what. What sayes <hi>Job? With-draw thy Hand from me, and let not thy Dread make me afraid: Then call thou, and I will answer; or let me speak, and answer thou me,</hi> Job 13. 21. It is not the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heavy Load of Sin, but the Discovery of Mercy; not the Roaring of the Devil, but the Drawing of the Father, that makes a Man come to Jesus
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:47254:116"/>
Christ: <hi>I my self know all these Things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True, sometimes, yea, most an end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they that come to Jesus Christ, come the Way that thou desirest; the Loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Tempted Way: But the Lord al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so leads some by the Waters of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. If I was to chuse, when to go a long Journey; to wit, Whether I would go it in the Dead of Winter, or in the Pleasant Spring, (though if it was a very profitable Journey, (as that of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Christ is) I would chuse to go it through Fire and Water, before I would lose the Benefit) I would chuse to go it in the Pleasant Spring; because the Way would be more Delightsome, the Dayes longer and Warmer, the Nights shorter, and not so Cold. And it is observable, that that very Argument that thou usest to weaken thy Strength in the Way, that very Argument Christ Jesus useth to incourage his Beloved to come to him: <hi>Arise</hi> (saith he) <hi>my Love, my Fair One, and come away;</hi> (Why?) <hi>For lo, the Winter is past, the Rain is over and gone, the Flowers appear in the Earth, the time of the Singing of Birds is come, and the Voyce of the Turtle is heard in our Land. The Fig-Tree</hi>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:47254:116"/>
                  <hi>putteth forth her Green Figs, and the Vine, with her tender Grapes, give a good Smell: Arise my Love, my Fair One, and come away,</hi> Song 2. 10, 11, 12, 13.</p>
               <p>Trouble not thy self therefore, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Sinner. If thou seest thy lost Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by Original and Actual Sin; if thou seest thy Need of the spotless Righteousness of Jesus Christ; if thou art willing to be found in him, and to take up thy Cross and follow him: Then pray for a fair Wind, and good Weather, and come away. Stick no longer in a Muse and Doubt about Things, but come away to Jesus Christ: Do it, I say, lest thou tempt God to lay the Sorrows of a Travelling Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man upon thee. Thy Folly in this thing, may make him do it. Mind what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: <hi>The Sorrows of a Travelling Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man shall come upon him: Why? He is an unwise Son; so he should not stay long in the Place of the breaking forth of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> Hos. 13. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Thy Fears that Christ will not Receive thee, may arise from those Decayes that thou findest in thy Soul, even while thou art coming to him: Some, even as they are coming to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:47254:117"/>
Christ, do find themselves grow worse and worse; And this is, indeed, a fore Tryal to the poor Coming-Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>To explain my self: There is such an one a coming to Jesus Christ; who, when at first, he began to look out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, was Sensible, Affectionate, and broken in Spirit: but now is grown Dark, Sensless, Hard-hearted, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to neglect Spiritual Duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Besides, he now finds in himself, Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to Unbelief, Atheisme, Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and the like: Now he finds, he cannot Tremble at God's Word, his Judgements, nor at the Apprehensions of Hell-fire: Neither can he, as he thinketh, be sorry for these Things. Now, this is a sad Dispensation: The Man under the Sixth Head, complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for want of Temptations; but thou hast enough of them: Art thou glad of them, Tempted, Coming-Sinner? They that never were Exercised with them, may think it a fine thing to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Range; but he that is there, is ready to sweat Blood for Sorrow of Heart, and to howl for Vexation of Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:47254:117"/>This man is in the Wilderness, among the wild Beasts: <hi>here</hi> he sees a Bear, <hi>there</hi> a Lyon, <hi>Yonder</hi> a Leopard, a Wolf, a Dragon: Devils of all sorts, doubts of all sorts: Fears of all sorts Haunt and Molest his Soul. Here he sees smoak, yea, feels fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, scattered upon his secret places; he hears the sound of an Horrible Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest.</p>
               <p>O! My friends, even the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus that knew all things, even He, saw no pleasure in Temptations, nor did He desire to be in them: Wherefore one, Text saith, <hi>he was led;</hi> and an other, <hi>he was driven</hi> of the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted of the Devil. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Mar.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
               <p>But to return, Thus it happeneth sometimes to them that are coming to Jesus Christ. A sad hap indeed; one would think, that he that is flying from Wrath to come, has little need of such Clogges as these; And yet so it is, and wofull experience proves it: The Church of old Complained, <hi>that her enemies over-took her, between the straights.</hi> Just between hope and fear, Heaven and Hell, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>This man feeleth the infirmity of his
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:47254:118"/>
flesh; he findeth a <hi>proneness</hi> in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be desperate: now he chides with God, Flings and Tumbles like a Wild Bull in a net, and still the guilt of all returns upon himself, to the Crushing of him to peices; Yet he feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his heart so hard, that he can find, as he thinks, no kind falling under any of his Miscarriages. Now he is a lump of confusion in his own eyes, whose Spirit, and Actions are without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>Temptations serve the Christian, as the Shepheards dogs serveth the silly sheep, that is coming behind the flock; he runs upon it, pulls it down, worry it, wound it, and grievously bedab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth it with dirt and wet in the lowest places of the Furrows of the field: And not leaving it, untill it is half dead; nor then neither, except God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke.</p>
               <p>Here is <hi>now</hi> room for fears of being cast away. <hi>Now</hi> I see I am lost, sayes the sinner; <hi>This</hi> is not coming to Jesus Christ, sayes the sinner; such a despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate hard, and wretched heart as mine is, cannot be a gracious one, saith the sinner: And bid such an one be Better; he sayes, I cannot, no I cannot.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="231" facs="tcp:47254:118"/>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But what will you say to a Soul in this condition?</p>
               <p>Answ. <hi>I will say, that Temptations have attended the best of Gods people; I will say, that Temptations come to do us good; and I will say also, that there is a difference betwixt growing worse and worse, and thy seeing more clearly how bad thou art.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a man of an ill-favoured coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, who hath too high a conceit of his beauty; and wanting the benefit of a glass, he still stands in his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit; at last a Limner is sent unto him, who draweth his ill-favoured face to the life: now looking thereon, he begins to be convinc't that he is not half so hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, as he thought he was. Coming sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, thy Temptations are these pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, they have drawn out thy ill-favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red heart to the life, and have set it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thine eyes, and now thou seest how ill favoured thou art.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was a good man, yet when he lay sick (for ought I know) he had some what too good an opinion of his heart; and for ought I know also, the Lord might, upon his recovery, leave him to a Temptation, that he might bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter know All that was in his heart.
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:47254:119"/>
Compare, <hi>Isa.</hi> 38. 1, 2, 3. with 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 32. 31.</p>
               <p>Alas! we are sinfull out of measure, but see it not to the full, untill an hour of Temptation comes: But when it comes, it doth as the Painter doth, it draweth out our heart to the life: Yet the sight of what we are, should not keep us from coming to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>There are two ways, by which God lets a man into a sight of the Naughty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his heart: One is, by the light of the Word, and spirit of God; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, by the Temptations of the Devil. But by the first, we see our naughtiness one way, and by the second, another. By the Light of the Word, and Spirit of God, thou hast a sight of thy naughty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as by the light of the Sun, thou hast a sight of the spots, and defilements that are in thy house or raiment. Which light gives thee to see a necessity of cleansing, but maketh not the blemishes to spread more abominably. But when Satan comes, when he tempts, he puts life and rage into our sins, and turnes them, as it were, into so many devils within us. Now like prisoners they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to brake through the prison of our
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:47254:119"/>
body; they will attempt to get out at our eyes, mouths, ears, any ways; To the Scandal of the Gospel, and Reproach of Religion, to the darkning of our evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and damning of our souls.</p>
               <p>But I shall say, as I said before, this hath oft times been the Lot of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And, <hi>No Temptation hath over-taken thee, but such as is common to man; and God is faithfull, who will not suffer thee to be tempted above what thou art able,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 13. See the Book of <hi>Job,</hi> the Book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> and that of the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations.</hi> And remember further, that Christ himself was tempted to blaspheme, to worship the devil, and to Murder him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. (<hi>Mat</hi> 4. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.) Temptations, worse then which, thou canst hardly be over-taken with. But he was sinless. That is true. And he is thy Saviour, and that is as true: Yea, it is as true also, that by his being tempted, he became the Conqueror of the tempter, and a succourer of those that are tempted, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14, 15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 17. chap. 4. 15, 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But what should be the reason, that some that are coming to Christ, should be so Lamentably cast down, and buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Temptations?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> It may be for several causes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:47254:120"/>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Some that are coming to Christ, cannot be perswaded, untill the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion comes, that they are so vile as the Scripture saith they are: True, they see so much of their wretchedness, as to drive them to Christ; but there is an <hi>over,</hi> and <hi>above,</hi> of wickedness, which they see not. <hi>Peter</hi> little thought that he had had Cursing, and Swearing, and Lying, and an inclination in his heart to deny his Master, before the Temptation came: But when that indeed, came upon him, then he found it there to his sorrow. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 36, 37, 38. <hi>Mark.</hi> 14. 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Some that are coming to Jesus Christ, are too much affected with their own graces, and too little taken with Christs person; wherefore God, to take them off from doteing upon their own Jewels, and that they might look more to the person; undertaking, and merits of his Son, plunges them into the ditch by Temptations. And this I take to be the meaning of <hi>Job. If I wash me,</hi> said he, <hi>with snow-water, and make my self never so clean, yet wilt thou plung me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me,</hi> Job 9. 30, 31. <hi>Job</hi> had been before a little too much Tampering with
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:47254:120"/>
his own graces, and setting his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies a little too high (as these Texts make manifest, <hi>Job</hi> 33. 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. chap. 34. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. chap. 35. 2, 3. chap. 38. 1, 2. chap. 40. 1, 2, 3, 4. chap. 42. 3, 4, 5, 6.) But by that the Temptation was ended, you find him better taught.</p>
               <p>Yea, God doth oft-times, even for this thing as it were, take our graces from us, and so leave us almost quite to our selves, and to the tempter, that we may learn not to love the <hi>Picture,</hi> more than the <hi>person</hi> of his Son. See how he dealt with them in the <hi>Sixteenth</hi> of <hi>Ezek,</hi> and the <hi>Second</hi> of <hi>Hosea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Perhaps thou hast been given too much, to Judge thy brother, to condemn thy brother, because a poor tempted man: And God, to bring down the pride of thy heart, letteth the tempter loose upon thee, that thou also mayest feel thy self weak. <hi>For pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.</hi> Pro. 16. 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It may be thou hast dealt a little too roughly with those that God hath this way wounded; not considering thy self, lest thou also be tempted: and therefore God hath suffered it to come unto thee, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:47254:121"/>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It may be thou wast given to slumber, and sleep, and therefore these Temptations were sent to awaken thee. You know that <hi>Peters</hi> Temptation came upon him, after his sleeping; then, instead of watching and praying; then he denyed, and denyed, and denyed his Master, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It may be thou hast presumed too far, and stood too much in thine own strength, and therefore is a time of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation come upon thee. This was also one cause, why it came upon <hi>Peter. Though all men forsake thee, yet will not I.</hi> Ah! that's the way to be tempted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 36, 37, 38.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> It may be, God intends to make thee wise, to speak a word in sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to others that are afflicted; and therefore he suffereth thee to be Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>Christ was tempted, that he might be able to succour them that are tempted.</hi> Heb. 2. 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> It may be <hi>Satan</hi> hath dared God, to suffer him to tempt thee; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising, that if he will but let him do it, <hi>thou wilt curse him to his face.</hi> Thus he obtained leave against <hi>Job;</hi> wherefore take heed, tempted soul, lest thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest the devils sayings true. <hi>Job</hi> 1. chap. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:47254:121"/>
                  <hi>Ninethly,</hi> It may be thy graces must be tryed in the fire, that that rust that clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to them, may be taken away, and themselves proved, both before Angels and Devils, far better than of Gold that perisheth; it may be also, that thy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are to receive special Praises and Honour, and Glory, at the coming of the Lord Jesus (to Judgement) for all the exploits that thou hast Acted by them against Hell, and its infernal crue, in the day of thy Temptation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 6, 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tenthly,</hi> It may be, God would have others learn by thy sighs, groans and complaints under Temptation, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of those sins; for the sake of which, thou art at present delivered to the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors.</p>
               <p>But to conclude this, put the worst to the worst, (and then things will be bad enough) suppose that thou art to this day without the grace of God, yet thou art but a miserable Creature, a sinner, that has need of a blessed Saviour; and the Text presents thee with one as good, and kind, as heart can wish: who also for thy incouragement saith, <hi>And him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi>

               <head>To come therefore to a word of <hi>Application.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IS it so? <hi>That they that are coming to Jesus Christ, are oft-times heartily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, that Jesus Christ will not receive them.</hi> Then this teacheth us these things:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That faith, and doubting, may at the same time have their residence in the same soul. <hi>O Thou of little faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore didst thou doubt?</hi> Mat. 14. 31. He saith not, O! Thou of <hi>No</hi> faith; but O! Thou of <hi>Little</hi> faith. Because he had a little faith in the midest of his many doubts. The same is true, even of many that are coming to Jesus Christ: They come, and fear they come, and doubt. When they look upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, or, a word of incouragement by faith, then they <hi>come;</hi> but when they look upon themselves, or the difficulties that lie before them, then they <hi>doubt.</hi> Bid me <hi>Come,</hi> said <hi>Peter: <hi>Come,</hi>
                  </hi> said Christ. So he went down out of the Ship to go to Jesus, but his hap was to go to him upon the water; There was the Tryal.
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:47254:122"/>
So it is with the poor desiring Soul. Bid me <hi>Come,</hi> sayes the sinner: <hi>Come,</hi> sayes Christ, and <hi>I will in no wise cast thee out.</hi> So he <hi>Comes,</hi> but his hap is to come upon the water, upon drowning difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; if therefore the wind of Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions blow, the waves of doubts and fears will presently arise, and this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sinner will begin to sink, if he has but little faith.</p>
               <p>But you shall find here, in <hi>Peters</hi> little faith, a two fold act; to wit, <hi>Coming,</hi> and <hi>Crying;</hi> Little faith <hi>cannot</hi> come <hi>all</hi> the way without crying: So long as its holy boldness lasts, so long it can come with peace; but when it, <hi>So,</hi> can come no farther, It will go the rest of the way with crying. <hi>Peter</hi> went as far as his little faith would carry him: he also cryed as loud as his little faith would help, <hi>Lord save me, I perish:</hi> And so with coming and crying, he was kept from sinking, though he had but a little faith. <hi>Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him: O! Thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Is it so? <hi>That they that are coming to Jesus Christ, are oft-times hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afraid, that Jesus Christ will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive</hi>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:47254:123"/>
                  <hi>them:</hi> Then this shews us a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of that Dejection, and those castings down, that very often we perceive to be in them, that are coming to Jesus Christ: Why, it is because they are afraid that Jesus Christ will not receive them. The poor World, they Mock us, because, we are a dejected people; I mean, because we are sometimes so: But they do not know the cause of our Dejections. Could we be perswaded, even then, when we are Dejected, that Jesus Christ, would indeed receive us: It would put more gladness into our hearts, than in the time in which their Corn, and Wine, and Oyl increases, <hi>Psal.</hi> 4. 6, 7. But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Is it so? <hi>That they that are coming to Jesus Christ, are oft-times hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily afraid that he will not receive them.</hi> Then this shews, that they that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Jesus Christ, are an awakned, sensible, considering people. For, fear cometh from sense, and consideration of things. They are sensible of sin, sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Curse due thereto; They are also sensible of the Glorious Majesty of God, and of what a blessed, blessed thing it is, to be received of Jesus Christ: The glory of Heaven, and evil of sin,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:47254:123"/>
these things they consider, and are sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of. <hi>When I remember, I am afraid; when I consider, I am afraid,</hi> Job 21. 6. chap. 36. 15.</p>
               <p>These things dash their spirits, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, and sensible; Were they dead like other men, they would not be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with <hi>fear,</hi> as they are; For dead men, Fear not, Feel not, Care not; but the living, and sensible man, he it is, that is oft times heartily afraid, that Jesus Christ will not receive him. I say, the dead, and senseless, are not distressed. <hi>They</hi> presume, <hi>they</hi> are groundlesly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident. <hi>Who so bold as blind Bayard.</hi> These indeed <hi>should</hi> fear, and be <hi>afraid,</hi> because they are not coming to Jesus Christ. O! The Hell, the Fire, the Pit, the Wrath of God, and Torments of Hell, that are prepared for poor neglecting sinners: <hi>How shall we escape, if we neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect so great Salvation!</hi> (Heb. 2. 3.) But they want sense of things, and so can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Is it so? <hi>That they that are coming to Jesus Christ, are oft-times hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily afraid, that he will not Receive them;</hi> Then this should teach <hi>Old</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to pity and pray for <hi>Young</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: <hi>You know the Heart of a Stranger,</hi>
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:47254:124"/>
                  <hi>for you your selves were Strangers in the Land of</hi> Egypt. You know the Fears, and Doubts, and Terrors, that take hold of them; for that they sometimes took hold of you. Wherefore, pity them, pray for them, encourage them; they need all this: Guilt hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken them, Fears of the Wrath of God hath over-taken them: Perhaps, they are within the Sight of Hell-fire; and the Fear of going thither, is burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-hot within their Hearts. You may know, how strangely Satan is suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Devilish Doubts unto them, if possible, he may sinck, and drown'd them with the Multitude, and weight of them. Old Christians, mend up the Paths for them, take the Stumbling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blocks out of the way; lest that which is Feeble and Weak be turned aside, but let it rather be Healed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="243" facs="tcp:47254:124"/>
               <head>I come now to the next <hi>Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and shall speak a little to that; to wit,</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>THat Jesus Christ would <hi>Not</hi> have them, that in truth are coming to him, <hi>Once</hi> think, That he will cast them out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Text is full for this: For, he saith; <hi>And him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi> Now, if he saith, <hi>I will not,</hi> he would not have us think, <hi>He will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is yet further manifest by these Considerations:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Christ Jesus did forbid even them, that <hi>as yet,</hi> were not coming to him, <hi>Once</hi> to think him such an one: <hi>Do not think</hi> (said he) <hi>that I will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse you to the Father,</hi> Joh. 5. 45.</p>
               <p>These (as I said) were such, that as yet, were not coming to him: For he saith of them a little before; <hi>And ye will not come to me:</hi> For the Respect they had to the Honour of Men, kept them back. Yet, I say, Jesus Christ
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:47254:125"/>
gives them to understand, that though he might Justly reject them, yet he would not; but bids them not Once <hi>to think, that he would accuse them to the Father.</hi> Now, not to Accuse (with Christ), is to Plead for: For Christ in these things, stands not Neuter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Father and Sinners. So then, If Jesus Christ would not have them think, that <hi>Yet</hi> will not come to him, that he will Accuse them; then he would not that they should think so, that in truth are coming to him. <hi>And him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> When the Woman taken in Adultery, (even in the very Act) was brought before Jesus Christ: So he carryed it, both by Words and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that he evidently enough made it manifest, that Condemning, and Cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-out, were such Things; for the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, he came not into the World.</p>
               <p>Wherefore, when they had set her before him, and had laid to her charge her Heinous Fact, he stooped down, and with his Finger wrote upon the Ground, as though he heard them not. Now, What did he do by this his Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iage,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:47254:125"/>
but testify plainly, That he was not for Receiving Accusations against poor Sinners, who-ever accused by? And observe; Though they continued asking, thinking at last to force him to Condemn her; yet then he so an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, as that he drove all Condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Persons from her. And then he adds, for her Encouragement to come to him; <hi>Neither do I Condemn thee; go, and Sin no more,</hi> Joh. 8. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>Not but that he indeed abhorred the Fact; but he would not Condemn the Woman for the Sin, because that was not his Office: <hi>He was not sent into the World, to condemn the World, but that the World through Him might be saved,</hi> Joh. 3. 17. Now, if Christ, though urged to it, would not Condemn the Guilty Woman, though she was far at present from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him; he would not that they should <hi>Once</hi> think, that he will cast them out, that in truth are coming to him: <hi>And him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Christ plainly bids the Turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinner, <hi>Come;</hi> and forbids him to Entertain any such Thought, as that <hi>He will cast him out. Let the Wicked</hi>
                  <pb n="246" facs="tcp:47254:126"/>
                  <hi>forsake his Ways, and the Unrighteous Man his Thoughts; and let him Turn unto the Lord, and he will have Mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly Pardon,</hi> Isa. 55. 7.</p>
               <p>The Lord, by bidding the Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous forsake his Thoughts; doth in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial forbid, as I have said, (to wit) those Thoughts, that hinder the Coming-Man in his Progress to Jesus Christ; <hi>His Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Thoughts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, he bids him, not only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake his Ways, but his Thoughts: <hi>Let the Wicked forsake his Ways, and the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous Man his Thoughts.</hi> 'Tis not enough to forsake <hi>one,</hi> if thou wilt come to Jesus Christ; because the <hi>other</hi> will keep thee from him. Suppose a Man forsakes his wicked Wayes, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched and filthy Life; yet if these Thoughts, <hi>That Jesus Christ will not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him,</hi> be entertained and nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his heart; them Thoughts will keep him from coming to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Sinner, Coming-Sinner; Art thou for coming to Jesus Christ? <hi>Yes,</hi> sayes the Sinner. Forsake thy wicked Wayes then. <hi>So I do,</hi> sayes the Sinner. Why comest thou then so slowly? <hi>Because</hi>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:47254:126"/>
                  <hi>I am hindred.</hi> What hinders? Has God forbidden thee? <hi>No.</hi> Art thou not willing to come faster? <hi>Yes: Yet I cannot.</hi> Well, prethee be plain with me, and tell me the Reason and Ground of thy Discouragement: <hi>Why?</hi> (saith the Sinner) <hi>though God forbids me not, and though I am willing to come faster; yet there naturally ariseth this, and that, and the other Thought in my Heart, that hinders my Speed to Jesus Christ. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, I think, I am not Chosen; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, I think, I am not Called; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, I think, I come too late; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, I think, I know not what it is to Come. Also, One while I think, I have no Grace; and then again, that I cannot Pray; and then again, I think, that I am a very Hypocrite: And these Things keep me from coming to Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Look ye now! Did not I tell you so? There are Thoughts yet remaining in the Heart, even of those that have forsaken their wicked Wayes; and with those Thoughts they are more plagued, than with any thing else; because they hinder their Coming to Jesus Christ: For the Sin of <hi>Unbelief,</hi> (which is the Original of all these Thoughts) is that which besets a Coming-Sinner <hi>more</hi> ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:47254:127"/>
than doth his Wayes; <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>But now, since Jesus Christ commands thee to forsake these Thoughts; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake them, Coming-sinner: And if thou forsake them not, thou Trangressest the Commands of Christ, and abidest thine own Tormentor, and keepest thy self from Establishment in Grace: <hi>If ye will not Believe, ye shall not be Established,</hi> Isa. 7. 9.</p>
               <p>Thus you see, how Jesus Christ set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth himself against such Thoughts, that any way discourage the Coming-Sinner; and thereby, truly vindicates the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine we have in hand; To wit, <hi>That Jesus Christ would not have them, that in truth are coming to him, <hi>Once</hi> think, that he will cast them out.</hi> And him that cometh to me, I will in <hi>No wise</hi> cast out.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:47254:127"/>
               <head>I come now to the <hi>Reasons</hi> of the <hi>Observation.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>1. IF Jesus Christ should allow thee <hi>Once</hi> to think, that he will Cast thee out; he must allow thee to think, that he will falsify his Word: For he hath said, <hi>I will in no wise cast out.</hi> But Christ would not that thou shouldst count him as One, that will falsify his Word: For he saith of himself, <hi>I am the Truth;</hi> Therefore, he would not, that any that in Truth are coming to him, should <hi>Once</hi> think, that he will cast them out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> If Jesus Christ should allow the Sinner, that in Truth is coming to him, <hi>Once</hi> to think, that he will cast him out: Then he must allow, and so coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the first Appearance of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; the which, he counteth his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Enemy; and against which, he has bent even his Holy Gospel. Therefore, Jesus Christ would not, that they that in Truth are coming to him, should <hi>Once</hi> think, that he will cast them out: See <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. 31. <hi>chap</hi> 21. 21. <hi>Mark</hi> 11. 23. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 25.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="tcp:47254:128"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If Jesus Christ should allow the Coming-Sinner, <hi>Once</hi> to think, that he will cast him out; then he must allow him to make a Question, Whether he is willing to Receive his Father's Gift? For the Coming-Sinner is his Father's Gift; as also sayes the Text: But he testifeth, <hi>All that the Father giveth him, shall come to him; and him that cometh, he will in no wise cast out.</hi> Therefore, Jesus Christ would not have him, that in Truth is coming to him, <hi>Once</hi> to think, that he will cast him out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If Jesus Christ should allow them <hi>Once</hi> to think (that indeed are coming to him) that he will cast him out; he must allow them to think, that he will despise and reject the Drawing of his Father: For <hi>No</hi> Man can come to him, but whom the Father draweth: But it would be high Blasphemy, and damnable Wickedness, <hi>Once</hi> to imagine thus. Therefore, Jesus Christ would not have him that cometh, <hi>Once</hi> think, that he will cast him out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> If Jesus Christ should allow those, that indeed are coming to him, <hi>Once</hi> to think, that he will cast them out; He must allow them to think,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:47254:128"/>
that he will be Unfaithful to the Trust, and Charge, that his Father hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him; which is to Save, and not to Lose, any thing of that which he hath given him to Save; <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 36. But the Father hath given him a Charge, to save the Coming-Sinner: Therefore, it cannot be, that he should allow, that such an one should <hi>Once</hi> think, that he will cast him out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> If Jesus Christ should allow, that they should <hi>Once</hi> think, that are coming to him, that he will cast them out: Then he must allow them to think, that he will be unfaithful to his Office of Priest-hood: For, as by the first part of it, he paid Price for, and Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somed Souls; so by the Second Part thereof, he continually maketh Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to God for them that come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 25. But he cannot allow us to question his Faithful Execution of his Priest-hood: Therefore, he cannot allow us <hi>Once</hi> to think, that the Coming-Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner shall be cast out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> If Jesus Christ should allow us <hi>Once</hi> to think, that the Coming-Sinner shall be cast out: Then he must allow us to question, his Will, or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or Merit to Save. But he cannot
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:47254:129"/>
allow us <hi>Once</hi> to question any of these: Therefore, not <hi>Once</hi> to think, that the Coming-Sinner shall be cast out.</p>
               <p>1. He cannot allow them to questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his <hi>Will:</hi> For he saith in the Text, <hi>I will in no wise cast out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. He cannot allow us to question his <hi>Power:</hi> For the Holy Ghost saith, He is <hi>Able</hi> to save to the uttermost, them that come.</p>
               <p>3. He cannot allow them to questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Efficacy of his Merit:</hi> For the Blood of Christ cleanseth the Commer from all Sin; 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. Therefore, he cannot allow, that he that is coming to him, should <hi>Once</hi> think, that he will cast him out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> If Jesus Christ should allow the coming sinner, <hi>Once</hi> to think, that he will cast him out; he must allow him to give the lie, to the manifest testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Father, Son, and Spirit: yea to the whole Gospel contained in <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> the <hi>Prophets,</hi> the book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> and that commonly called the New-Testament: But he cannot allow of this, therefore, not that the coming sinner should <hi>Once</hi> think that he will cast him out.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:47254:129"/>
                  <hi>Ninethly,</hi> Lastly. If Jesus Christ should allow him that is coming to him, <hi>Once</hi> to think that he will cast him out: He must allow him to question his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Oath; Which he in truth, and Righteousness, hath taken; that they might have a strong Consolation, who have fled for refuge to Jesus Christ: But he cannot allow this, therefore he cannot allow that the coming sinner should once think that he will cast him out, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.</p>

               <p>3. He is far from the Work of the Holy Ghost, the Work of Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a Second Creation; without which, no Man shall see the Kingdom of Heaven; <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 3.</p>
               <p>4. He is far from Righteousness, from that Righteousness that should make him Acceptable in God's Sight; <hi>Isa.</hi> 46. 14.</p>
               <p>5. He is under the Power and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Sin; Sin reigneth in and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him; it dwelleth in every Faculty of his Soul, and Member of his Body: So that, from Head to Foot, there is no
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:47254:130"/>
place clean; <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.</p>
               <p>6. He is in the Pest-house, with <hi>Uz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah;</hi> and excluded the Camp of <hi>Israel,</hi> with the Leapers; 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26. 21. <hi>Numb.</hi> 5. 2.</p>
               <p>7. His Life is among the Unclean; <hi>He is in the Gall of Bitterness, and in the Bond of Iniquity,</hi> Job 36. 14. Act. 8. 23.</p>
               <p>8. He is in Sin, in the Flesh, in Death, in the Snare of the Devil, and is taken Captive by him at his Will; 1 Cor. 15. 17. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 8. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 26.</p>
               <p>9. He is under the Curse of the Law; and the Devil dwells in him, and hath the Mastery of him; <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 13. Eph. 2. 2, 3. Acts 36. 18</p>
               <p>10. He is in Darkness, and walketh in Darkness, and knows not whither he goes; for Darkness has blinded his Eyes.</p>
               <p>11. He is in the Broad-way, that lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Destruction; and holding on, he will assuredly go in at the Broad-gate, and so down the Stairs to Hell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> What is he, that cometh not to Jesus Christ?</p>
               <p>1. He is counted one of God's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; <hi>Luk.</hi> 19 14.. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:47254:131"/>2. He is a Child of the Devil, and of Hell; for the Devil begat him, as to his sinful Nature; and Hell must swallow him at last, because he cometh not to Jesus Christ; <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 44. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 15. <hi>Psal.</hi> 9. 17.</p>
               <p>3. He is a Child of Wrath, an Heir of it; 'tis his Portion, and God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay it him to his Face; <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Job</hi> 21. 29, 30, 31.</p>
               <p>4. He is a Self-Murder; he wrongeth his own Soul, and is one that loveth Death; <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 35, 36.</p>
               <p>5. He is a Companion for Devils, and Damned Men; <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 41.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whither is he like to go, that cometh not to Jesus Christ?</p>
               <p>1. He that cometh not To him, is like to go <hi>Further</hi> from him; for every Sin, is a Step further from Jesus Christ; <hi>Hos.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>2. As he is in Darkness, so he is like to go on in it: For Christ is the Light of the World; and he that comes not to him, walketh in Darkness, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 12.</p>
               <p>3. He is like to be removed at last, as far from God, and Christ, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:47254:131"/>
and all Felicity, as an Infinitie God can remove him; <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 41.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Doctrine of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Christ, informeth us, <hi>Where poor destitute Sinners may find Life for their Souls;</hi> and that is in Christ: This Life is in his Son; he that hath the Son, hath Life: And again; <hi>Whoso findeth me, findeth Life, and shall obtain Favor of the Lord,</hi> Prov. 8.</p>
               <p>Now, for further Enlargement, I will also here propound three more Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. What Life is in Christ?</item>
                  <item>2. Who may have it?</item>
                  <item>3. Upon what Terms?</item>
               </list>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> What Life is in Jesus Christ?</p>
               <p>1. There is Justifying Life in Christ. Man, by Sin, is Dead in Law; and Christ only can deliver him by his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and Blood, from this Death, into a State of Life: <hi>For God sent his Son into the World, That we might Live through him,</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 9. That is, through the Righteousness which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish, and the Death that he should dye.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:47254:132"/>2. There is Eternal Life in Christ: Life that's endless; Life for ever, and ever. <hi>He hath given us Eternal Life; and this Life is in his Son,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.</p>
               <p>Now, Justification, and Eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, being both in Christ, and no where else to be had for Men, Who would not come to Jesus Christ?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Who may have this Life?</p>
               <p>I answer; Poor, Helpless, miserable Sinners: Particularly,</p>
               <p>1. Such as are willing to have it; <hi>Whosoever will,</hi> Let <hi>him take the Water of Life,</hi> Revel. 22. 17.</p>
               <p>2. He that Thirsteth for it: <hi>I will give to him that is a Thirst, of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Water of Life,</hi> Revel. 21. 6.</p>
               <p>3. He that is weary of his Sins. <hi>This is the Rest, whereby ye may cause the Weary to rest; and this is the Refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> Isa. 28. 12.</p>
               <p>4. He that is Poor and Needy. <hi>He shall spare the Poor and Needy, and shall save the Souls of the Needy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. He that followeth after him, crying for Life. <hi>He that follows me, shall not walk in Darkness, but shall have the Light of Life,</hi> Joh. 8. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:47254:132"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Upon what Terms may he have this Life?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Freely: Sinner, Dost thou hear? Thou may'st have it Freely. Let him take the Water of Life Freely: I will give him of the Fountain of the Water of Life Freely. <hi>And when they had nothing to pay, he</hi> Frankly <hi>forgave them both,</hi> Luk. 7.</p>
               <p>Freely, without Money, or without Price. <hi>Ho! Every one that Thirsteth, come ye to the Waters; and he that hath no Money, Come ye, Buy and Eat: Yea, come, buy Wine and Milk, without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and without Price,</hi> Isa. 55. 1.</p>
               <p>Sinner, Art thou Thirsty? art thou Weary? art thou Willing? Come then, and regard not your Stuff; for all the Good that is in Christ, is offered to the Coming-Sinner, without Mony, and without Price. He has Life to give a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, to such as want it, and that have not a Penny to purchase it; and he will give it Freely: Oh, What a blessed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is the Coming-Sinner in!</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This Doctrine of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Jesus Christ for Life; <hi>Informeth us, That</hi> It <hi>is to be had no where else:</hi> Might it be had Any where else, the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:47254:133"/>
Text, and Him that spoke it, would be but little set-by: For, What great Matter is there in, <hi>I will in no wise cast out,</hi> if another stood by that could Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them? But here appears the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Christ, that none but He can Save! And, here appears his Love, that though none can Save but He, yet he is not Coy in Saving! <hi>But him that comes to me</hi> (saith he) <hi>I will in no wise cast out.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That none can Save but Jesus Christ, is evident from <hi>Acts</hi> 4. 12. <hi>Neither is there Salvation in any other; and he hath given us Eternal Life, and this Life is in his Son.</hi> If Life could have been had any where else, it should have been in the Law; but it is not in the Law: For, by the Deeds of the Law, no Man living shall be Justifyed; and if not Justifyed, then no Life. Therefore, Life is no where to be had, but in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ; <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But why would God so order it, that <hi>Life</hi> should be had no where else, but in Jesus Christ?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> There is Reason for it; and that both with Respect to God, and to Us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:47254:133"/>First, <hi>With Respect to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That it might be in a way of <hi>Justice,</hi> as well as <hi>Mercy:</hi> And in away of Justice it could not have been, if it had not been by Christ; because He, and He only, was able to answer the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Law; and give for Sin, what the Justice thereof required. All Angels had been Crushed down to Hell for ever, had that Curse been laid upon them for our Sins, which was laid upon Jesus Christ: But 'twas laid upon Him, and He bare it; and answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Penalty, and Redeemed his People from under it, with that Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to Divine Justice, that God himself doth now proclaim; That he is Faithful and Just to forgive us, if by Faith we shall venture on Jesus, and trust to what he has done for Life; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24, 25, 26. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Life must be by Jesus Christ, that God might be Adored, and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyed, for finding out this Way. This is the Lord's Doings, that in all Things he might be Glorifyed, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It must be by Jesus Christ, that Life might be at God's dispose; who hath great Pity for the Poor, the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:47254:134"/>
Lowly, the Meek, the Broken in heart; and for them that others care not for, <hi>Psal.</hi> 34. 6. <hi>Psal.</hi> 138. 6. <hi>Psal.</hi> 25. <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 17. <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Life must be in Christ, to cut off boasting from the lips of men. This also is the Apostles reason, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 26, 27. And <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Life must be in Jesus Christ, with <hi>respect to us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That we might have it upon the easiest Termes, to wit, <hi>Freely,</hi> as a gift, not as wages; was it in <hi>Moses</hi> hand, we should come hardly at it. Was it in the <hi>Popes</hi> hand, we should pay sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for it: but thanks be to God, it is in Christ, laid up in him, and by him, to be communicated to sinners upon ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie Termes, even for receiving, accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and imbraceing with Thanksgiving. As the Scriptures plainly declare, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 11, 12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 13, 14, 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Life is in Christ <hi>for us,</hi> that it might not be upon so brittle a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, as indeed it would, had it been any where else. The Law it self is weak because of us, as to this: But Christ is a tryed stone, a sure foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:47254:134"/>
one that will not fail to bear thy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and to receive thy Soul; coming sinner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Life is in Christ, that it might be sure to all the seed. Alas! the best of us, was life left in our hands, to be sure, we should forfeit it, over, and over, and over: or was it in any other hand, we should by our often back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slidings, so offend him, that at last he would shut up his bowels in everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing displeasure against us. But now it is in Christ, it is with one that can pity, pray for, pardon, yea multiply par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons: It is with one that can have Compassion upon us, when we are out of the way; with one that hath an heart to fetch us again, when we are gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stray; with one that can pardon without upbraiding. Blessed be God, that life is in Christ! For Now 'tis sure, to all the seed.</p>
               <p>But Fourthly. This Doctrine of coming to Jesus Christ for life, informs us of the evil of Unbelief; that wicked thing, that is the only, or chief hindrance to the coming sinner. Doth the Text say, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>? Doth it say, <hi>And him that cometh, I will in no wise cast out?</hi> Then what an evil is that, that keepeth sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:47254:135"/>
from coming to Jesus Christ? And that evil is unbelief. For by faith we come, by Unbelief we keep away. Therefore <hi>It</hi> is said to be that, by which a Soul is said to depart from God; because it was that, which at first caused the world to go off from him; and that also that keeps them from him to this day. And it doth it the more easily, because it doth it with a wile. This sin may be called, <hi>The White Devil;</hi> for it often-times in its Mischievous doings in the Soul, shews as if it was an Angel of Light. Yea, it Acteth like a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellor of Heaven: Therefore a little to discourse of this evil disease.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It is that sin, <hi>above all others,</hi> that hath some shew of <hi>reason</hi> in its attempts. For it keeps the Soul from Christ, by pretending its present unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and unpreparedness; as want of more sense of sin, want of more repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, want of more humility, want of a more broken heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is the sin, that most Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with the <hi>Conscience:</hi> the Conscience of the coming sinner, tells him that he hath nothing good, that he stands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditable for Ten Thousand Tallents; that he is a very ignorant, blind, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:47254:135"/>
sinner, unworthy to be once taken notice of by Jesus Christ: And will you (says Unbelief) in such a case as you now are, presume to come to Jesus Christ?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is the sin that most Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth with our <hi>Sense of feeling.</hi> The coming sinner, feels the workings of sin, of all manner of sin, and wretchedness, in his flesh: He also feels the Wrath, and Judgement of God due to sin, and oft-times staggers under it: Now, sayes unbelief, you may see you have no grace, for that which works in you, <hi>is corruption;</hi> You may also perceive, that God doth not love you, because the Sense of his Wrath abides upon you: Therefore how can you bear the face to come to Jesus Christ?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It is the sin, above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that most Suiteth with the <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of our flesh: the Wisdom of our flesh, thinks it prudence to question a while, to stand back a while, to heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to both sides a while, and not to be rash, sudden or unadvised, in too bold a presuming upon Jesus Christ: And this Wisdom Unbelief falls in with.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It is that sin above all other, that continually is whispering the Soul
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:47254:136"/>
in the ear, with mistrusts of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of God, in keeping promise to them that come to Jesus Christ for life. It also suggesteth mistrust<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> about Christs willingness to receive it, and save it. And no sin can do this so Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently as Unbelief.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It is also that sin, which is always at hand, to enter an Objection against this or that Promise, that by the Spirit of God is brought to our heart, to comfort us; and if the poor coming sinner, is not aware of it, it will by some evasion, slite, trick or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, quickly wrest from him the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise again, and he shall have but little benefit of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> It is that above all other sins, that weakens our Prayers, our faith, our love, our diligence, our hope and expectations: It even taketh the heart away from God in duty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eightly,</hi> Lastly. This sin, as I have said even now, it appeareth in the Soul with so many sweet pretences to safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and security; that it is, as if it were, Counsel sent from Heaven. Bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Soul be wise, wary, considerate, well advised, and to take heed of too rash a venture upon Believing. Besure
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:47254:136"/>
first, that God loves you; take hold of no promise untill you are forced by God unto it; neither be you sure of your Salvation, doubt it still, though the testimony of the Lord has been often confirmed in you: live not by faith, but by sense: and when you can neither see nor feel, then fear and mistrust, then doubt, and question all. This is the Devilish counsel of Unbelief, which is so covered over with specious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, that the wisest Christian can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shake off these reasonings.</p>
               <p>But to be brief: Let me here give thee, Christian Reader, a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular description of the qualities of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, by opposing Faith unto it, in these Twenty five particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First.</hi> Faith, believeth the word of God, but Unbelief questioneth the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly of the same, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 24.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> Faith, believeth the word, <hi>because it is true;</hi> but Unbelief doubteth thereof, <hi>because it is true,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 3. Joh. 8. 45.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly.</hi> Faith, sees more in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of God to help, than in all other things to hinder: But Unbelief, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing Gods promise, saith, How can these things be? <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 19, 20, 21. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 7. 2. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 4, 12. <hi>Fourthly,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="268" facs="tcp:47254:137"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Faith will make thee see love in the heart of Christ, when with his mouth he giveth reproofs: But Unbelief will imagine wrath in his heart, when with his mouth, and word, he saith he loves us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. <hi>Numb.</hi> 13. 2. chap. 14. 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Faith will help the Soul to wait, though God deferres to give: but Unbelief will take snuff, and throw up all, if God make any tarrying, <hi>Psal.</hi> 25. 5. <hi>Isa.</hi> 8. 17. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. 33. <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. 13, 14.</p>
               <p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Faith maketh great burdens light; but Unbelief maketh light ones in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerably heavy, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 2, 13.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Fourteenthly,</hi> By Faith, the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ is imputed to us; but by Unbelief, we are shut up under the Law to Perish: <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 23, 24. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. 32. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 23.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifteenthly,</hi> Faith maketh our Work acceptable to God through Christ; but whatsoever is of Unbelief, is Sin: For without Faith, it is impossible to please him; <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 6.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Seventeenthly,</hi> Faith makes us see Preciousness in Christ; but Unbelief sees no Form, Beauty, or Comlyness in him: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighteenthly,</hi> By Faith we have our Life in Christ's Fulness; but by Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, we starve and pine away: <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20.</p>

                  <hi>Nineteenthly,</hi> Faith giveth us the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory over the Law, Sin, Death, the Devil, and all Evils; but Unbelief lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us Obnoxious to them all: 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 4, 5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 46.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Twentyeth,</hi> Faith will shew us more Excellency in Things not seen, than in them that are; but Unbelief sees more in Things that are here, than in Things that will be here-after: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 24, 25, 26, 27. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 32.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Twenty-First,</hi> Faith maketh the Ways of God pleasant, and amiable; but Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief maketh them heavy, and hard: <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 6. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 10, 11. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 60. <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. 3.</p>

                  <hi>Twenty-Second,</hi> By Faith, <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> possessed the Land of Promise; But because of Unbelief, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Aaron,</hi> nor <hi>Moses,</hi> nor <hi>Mirian,</hi> could get thither: <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 9. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 19.</p>

                  <hi>Twenty-Fourth,</hi> By Faith, <hi>Gidion</hi> did more with Three-hundred men, and a few empty Pitchers, than all the <hi>Twelve Tribes</hi> could do; because they believed not God: <hi>Judg.</hi> 7. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 11, 44.</p>

               <p>WE come now to a <hi>Use of Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</hi> Sinner, Thou hast heard of the Necessity of Coming to Christ; also, Of the Willingness of Christ, to Receive the Coming-Soul: Together, with the Benefit, that <hi>They</hi> by him shall have, <hi>that</hi> indeed come to Him. Put thy self now upon this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Enquiry; <hi>Am I, indeed, come to Jesus Christ?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Motives, plenty, I might here urge, to prevail with thee to a Conscientious Performance of this Duty: As,</p>
               <p>1. Thou art in Sin, in the Flesh, in Death, in the Snare of the Devil, and under the Curse of the Law; if thou art not coming to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>2. There is no way to be delivered from these, but by coming to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>3. If thou comest, Jesus Christ will Receive thee, and will <hi>in no wise cast thee out.</hi>

                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:47254:139"/>4. Thou wilt <hi>not</hi> Repent it in the Day of <hi>Judgement,</hi> if <hi>now</hi> thou comest to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</p>
               <p>5. But thou wilt surely Mourn at last, if now thou shalt refuse to come: And,</p>
               <p>6. Lastly, Now thou hast been invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to come; now will thy Judgment be greater, and thy Damnation more fearful, if thou shalt yet Refuse, than if thou hadst never heard of Coming to Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But we hope, we are come to Jesus Christ?</p>

                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 'Tis well, if it proves so. But lest thou should speak without Ground, and so fall unawares into Hell Fire; Let us Examine a little.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Art thou, indeed, come to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ? What hast thou left behind thee? What didst thou come away from, in thy Coming to Jesus Christ?</p>
               <p>When <hi>Lot</hi> came out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> he left the <hi>Sodomites</hi> behind him; <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.</p>

               <p>When <hi>Peter</hi> came to Christ, he left his Nets behind him; <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 18.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Zacheus</hi> came to Christ, he left the Receipt of Custom behind him; <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> came to Christ, he left his own Righteousness behind him; <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip.</hi> 3. 7, 8.</p>
               <p>When those that used Curious Arts came to Jesus Christ, they took their Curious Books, and burned them; though in another Man's Eye, they were counted worth Fifty-Thousand Peices of Silver: <hi>Acts</hi> 19. 18, 19, 20.</p>
               <p>What say'st thou, Man? Hast thou left thy Darling Sins, thy <hi>Sodomitish</hi> Pleasures, thy Acquaintance, and vain Companions; thy unlawful Gain, thy Idol Gods, and Righteousness, and thy unlawful Curious Arts, behind thee?

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Art thou come to Jesus Christ? Prethee tell me, VVhat <hi>moved</hi>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:47254:140"/>
hee come to Jesus Christ? Men do not usually come, or go, to this or that Place, before they have a <hi>Moving</hi> Cause; or rather, a Cause moving them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: No more do they come to Jesus Christ, (I do not say) before they <hi>have</hi> a Cause; but before <hi>that</hi> Cause <hi>moveth</hi> them to come: What say'st thou? Hast thou a Cause <hi>moving</hi> thee to come? To be at present, in a State of Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, is <hi>Cause</hi> sufficient for Men to come to Jesus Christ for Life: But that will not do, except that Cause move them; the which, it will never do, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til their Eyes be opened, to see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in that Condition. For it is not a Man's being under Wrath, but his seeing it, that moveth him to come to Jesus Christ. Alas! <hi>All</hi> Men by Sin. are under Wrath; yet but few of that <hi>All,</hi> came to Jesus Christ: And the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because they do not see their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. <hi>Who hath warned you, to flee from the Wrath to come,</hi> Mat. 3. 7. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Men are warned, and also, receive the VVarning, they will not come to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Take three or four Instances for this:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> came not to Jesus Christ, until they Received the Alarum;
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:47254:141"/>
the Conviction of their Undone State by Sin: <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>2. The Children of <hi>Israel</hi> cryed not out for a Mediator, before they saw themselves in danger of Death by the Law; <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. 18, 19.</p>
               <p>3. Before the <hi>Publican</hi> came, he saw himself lost and undone; <hi>Luk</hi> 18. 13.</p>
               <p>4. The <hi>Prodigal</hi> came not, until he saw Death at the Door, ready to devour him: <hi>Luk.</hi> 15. 17, 18.</p>
               <p>5. The Three-Thousand came not, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they knew not what to do, to be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 37, 38, 39.</p>
               <p>6. <hi>Paul</hi> came not, until he saw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self lost and undone; <hi>Acts</hi> 9. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 11.</p>
               <p>7. Lastly, Before the Jayler came, he saw himself undone; <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 29, 30, 31. And I tell thee, It is an easier thing to perswade a Well-Man to go to the Physitian for Cure, or a Man without Hurt, to seek out for a Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to Cure him; than it is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade a Man, that sees not his Soul-Disease, to come to Jesus Christ. <hi>The Whole have <hi>No</hi> need of the Physitian:</hi> Then, Why should they go to him? The full Pitcher can hold no more; then, Why should it go to the Fountain?

And, if thou comest full, thou comest not aright; and be sure, Christ will send thee Empty away: <hi>But he healeth the Broken in Heart, and bindeth up their Wounds,</hi> Mar. 2. 17. <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 3. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 53.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Art thou <hi>Coming</hi> to Jesus Christ? Prethee tell me, What seest thou in him, to allure thee to forsake all the VVorld, to come to him? I say, VVhat hast thou seen in him? Men must see something in Jesus Christ, else, they will not come to him.</p>
               <p>1. VVhat Comlyness hast thou seen in his Person? Thou comest not, if thou seest no Form, nor Comlyness in him; <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>2. Until those mentioned in the <hi>Song,</hi> were convinced, that there was more Beauty, Comlyness, and Desirableness in Christ, than in Ten-Thousand; they did not so much as ask, VVhere he was, nor incline to turn aside after him; <hi>Song</hi> 5. <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>There be many Things on this side Heaven, that <hi>Can</hi> and <hi>Do,</hi> carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Heart; and so will do, so long as thou Livest, if thou shalt be kept blind, and not be admitted to see the

beauty of the Lord Jesus.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Art thou <hi>come</hi> to the Lord Jesus; what hast thou found in him, since thou camest to him?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> found with him the words of eternal life, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 68.</p>
               <p>They that <hi>Peter</hi> makes mention of, found him a Living stone, even such a living stone as Communicated life to them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</p>

               <p>Let us go back to the times of the Old Testament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, Abraham</hi> found that in him, that made him Leave his Countrey for him, and become for his sake a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim, and stranger in the earth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</p>

               <p>Let's come down to Martyrs.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What saw <hi>Romanus</hi> in Christ, when he said to the rageing Emperor, who threatned him with fearful Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; <hi>Thy Sentence O Emperor, I Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully imbrace, and refuse not to be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed—by as Cruel Torments as thou canst invent,</hi> pag. 116.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> What saw <hi>Menas</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian in Christ, when he said under most Cruel Torments; <hi>Ther eis nothing in my mind, that can be compared to the Kingdome of Heaven; neither is all the World, if it was weighed in the ballance, to be conferred with the price of one Soul; who is able to separate us from the Love of Jesus Christ our Lord; and I</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> What, think you, did <hi>Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> see in Christ, when rejoyceingly she went to meet the Souldier, that was appointed to be her Executioner: <hi>I will willingly</hi> (said she) <hi>receive into my Paps, the length of his Sword, and into my Breasts will draw the force thereof even to the hilts; that thus I, being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Christ my Spouse, may surmount and escape all the darkness of this World,</hi> pag. 122.</p>

                  <hi>rather lose, than to speak one wicked and blasphemous word against my Creator,</hi> pag. 123.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eightly,</hi> What did <hi>Marcus Arethusius,</hi> see in Christ, when after his enemies had cut his flesh, anointed it with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and hanged him up in a basket, for flies and bees to feed on, <hi>he would not (give to up-hold Idolatry) one half penny to save his life,</hi> pag. 129.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ninethly,</hi> What did <hi>Constantine,</hi> see in Christ, when he used <hi>to kiss the wounds of them that suffered for him.</hi> pag. 135.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tenthly,</hi> But what need I give, thus, particular instances of words, and smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler actions, when by their lives their blood, their induring hunger, sword, fire, pulling a sunder, and all Torments that the Devil, and Hell could devise, for the love they bare to Christ, after they were come to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What hast thou found in him sinner?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What! come to Christ, and find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in him (when all things that are worth looking after, are in him; or if any thing, yet not enough to wean thee from thy sinfull delights, and flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lusts: Away, away: thou art not come to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:47254:144"/>He that is come to Jesus Christ, hath found in him, that, as I said, that is not to be found any where else. As,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> He that is come to Christ, hath found God in him reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes to them: And so God is not to be found in Heaven and earth besides, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 19, 20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> He that is come to Jesus Christ, hath found in him a fountain of grace, sufficient, not only to pardon sin, but to Sanctifie the Soul, and to preserve it from falling in this evil World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He that is come to Jesus Christ, hath found vertue in him: That vertue, that if he does but touch thee with his Word; or thou, him by Faith: Life is forthwith conveyed into thy Soul: It makes thee wake as one that is wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked out of his sleep: it awakes all the powers of thy Soul. <hi>Psal.</hi> 30. 11, 12. <hi>Song.</hi> 6. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Art thou come to Jesus Christ? thou hast found glory in him, glory that Surmounts, and goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond: <hi>Thou art more glorious than the mountaines of pray,</hi> Psal. 76. 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:47254:144"/>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> What shall I say? thou hast found Righteousness in him; Thou hast found rest, peace, delight, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, glory and eternal life. Sinner, be advised, Ask thy heart again, saying; Am I come to Jesus Christ? For, upon this one question, <hi>Am I <hi>Come,</hi>
                  </hi> or, <hi>am I <hi>Not,</hi>
                  </hi> Hangs Heaven and Hell, as to thee. If thou canst say, <hi>I am come;</hi> and God shall approve that saying; Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, Happy, Happy man art thou! but if thou art <hi>not come,</hi> what can make thee happy: Yea what can make <hi>that</hi> man Happy, that for his not coming to Jesus Christ for life, must be damned in Hell?</p>

               <head>The Third Use; a Use of Encouragement.</head>
               <p>COming Sinner, I have now a word for thee; be of good comfort, <hi>He will in no wise cast out.</hi> Of all men, thou art the blessed of the Lord; the the Father hath prepared his Son to be a Sacrifice for thee; and Jesus Christ thy Lord is gone to prepare a place for thee, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 29. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:47254:145"/>What shall I say to thee? thou comest to a full Christ, thou canst not want a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, for Soul or body, for this World, or that to come, but it is to be had, in, or by Jesus Christ,</p>
               <p>As it is said of the Land, that the <hi>Dannits</hi> went to possess, So, and with much more truth, it may be said of Christ: He is such <hi>an one, with whom there is no want of any good thing that is in Heaven or earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A Full Christ, is thy Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First, He is full of <hi>Grace.</hi>
                  </hi> Grace is sometimes taken for <hi>love,</hi> and take it so here. He is full of <hi>love;</hi> never any <hi>loved</hi> like Jesus Christ. <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans</hi> love went <hi>beyond</hi> the love of <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi> but the love of Christ <hi>passes know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> It is beyond the love of all the Earth, of all Creatures, even of Men and Angels. His love prevailed with him to lay aside his Glory, to leave the Heavenly place, to cloth himself with flesh, to be born in a Stable, to be laid in a Manger, to live a poor life in the World, to take upon him our sicknesses, infirmities, sins, curse, Death, and the Wrath that was due to man. And all this he did, for a base, undeserving, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull people: yea, for a people that
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:47254:145"/>
was at Enmity with him. <hi>For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die, yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure for a good man, some would even dare to die. But God commended his love towards us, in that while we were yet sinners Christ dyed for us. Much more then being now justified, we shall be saved by his life. For if when we were Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, we were reconciled to God by the Death of his Son: much more, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, we shall be saved by his life,</hi> Rom. 5. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, He is full of <hi>Truth.</hi>
                  </hi> Full of grace, and truth. <hi>Truth,</hi> that is, faithfulness in keeping promise, even this of the Text, (with all other) <hi>I will in no wise cast out.</hi> Hence it is said, that his words be true, and that he is the faithfull God that keepeth covenant. And hence it is also that his promise is called Truth, <hi>Thou wilt fulfill thy truth unto</hi> Jacob, <hi>and thy mercy to</hi> Abraham, <hi>which thou hast sworn unto our Fathers, from the days of old.</hi> Therefore it is said again, that both himself, and words are Truth. I am the Truth, the Scriptures of Truth, thy Word is Truth, thy Law is the Truth, and my mouth,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:47254:146"/>
aith he, shall speak truth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 6. <hi>Dan.</hi> 10. 21. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 17. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 28. <hi>Pro.</hi> 8. 7. <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 142. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>Isa.</hi> 25. 1. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 25. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 12, 13.</p>
               <p>Now I say, his word is truth, and he is full of truth, to fulfill his truth even to a Thousand Generations. Coming sinner, he will not deceive thee, come boldly to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>He is full of <hi>Wisdome,</hi> He is made unto us of God Wisdome, Wisdome</hi> to manage the affairs of his Church in general, and the affairs of every coming sinner, in particular. And upon this account he is said to be <hi>head over all things,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he manages all things that are in the world by his <hi>Wisdom,</hi> for the good of his Church; all mens Actions, all Satans Temptations, all Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, all Crosses, Disappointments; all things what ever, are under the hand of Christ (Who is the <hi>Wisdom</hi> of God,) and he ordereth them all for good to his Church; And can Christ help it, (and be sure he can) nothing shall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, or fall out in the world, but it shall, in despite of all opposition, have a good tendency to his Church and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="287" facs="tcp:47254:146"/>Fourthly, <hi>He is full of the</hi> Spirit, to communicate it to the coming Sinner; he hath therefore received it without measure, that he may communicate it to every member of his body, according as every mans measure thereof is allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him by the Father. Wherefore he saith, that he that comes to him, <hi>Out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> Joh. 3. 34. Tit. 3. 5, 6. Acts 1. Joh. 7. 31, 32, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>He is indeed a store-house,</hi> full of all the graces of the Spirit. <hi>Of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness have all we received, and grace for grace.</hi> Here is <hi>more</hi> Faith, <hi>more</hi> Love, <hi>more</hi> Sincerity, <hi>more</hi> Humility, <hi>more</hi> of every Grace; and of this, even more of this he giveth to every Lowly, Humble, Penitent coming Sinner: wherefore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Soul, thou comest not to a barren wilderness, when thou comest to Jesus Christ, <hi>John</hi> 1. 16.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>He is full of Bowels and Compassion;</hi> And they shall feel, and find it so, that come to him for Life. He can <hi>bear</hi> with thy Weaknesses, he can <hi>pity</hi> thy Ignorance, he can be <hi>touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> with the Feeling of thine Infirmities, he can <hi>affectionately</hi> forgive thy Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, he can <hi>heal</hi> thy Back slidings,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:47254:147"/>
and <hi>Love thee Freely.</hi> His Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons fail not: <hi>And he will not break a bruised Reed, nor quench the smoaking Flax: He can pity them, that no Eye pities, and be afflicted in all thy Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> Mat. 26. 41. Heb. 5 2. Chap. 2. 18, 19. Mat 9. 2. Hos. 14. 4. Ezek. 16. 5, 6. Isa. 63. 9. Psal. 78. 38. Psal. 86. 15. Psal. 111. 4. Psal. 112. 4. Lam. 3. 22. Isa. 42. 3.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>Coming Soul, the</hi> Jesus <hi>that thou art coming to, is full of <hi>Might,</hi> and Terribleness, for thy Advantage;</hi> He can suppress all thine Enemies: He is the Prince of the Kings of the Earth; He can bow all Men's Designes for thy Help: He can break all Snares laid for thee in the Way: He can lift thee out of all Difficulties, where-with thou may'st be surrounded. <hi>He is Wise in Heart, and Mighty in Power.</hi> Every Life under Heaven is in his Hand; yea, the Faln Angels tremble before him: And he will save thy Life, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Sinner; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 15. <hi>Psal.</hi> 19. 3. <hi>Psal.</hi> 27. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Job</hi> 9. 4. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 29. <hi>Luk</hi> 8. 28. <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 19.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, <hi>Coming-Sinner, The Jesus to whom thou art coming, is <hi>Lowly</hi> in</hi>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:47254:147"/>
                  <hi>Heart;</hi> He despiseth not any: 'Tis not thy outward Meanness, nor thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Weakness; 'tis not because thou art Poor, or Base, or Deformed, or a Fool, that he will despise thee. <hi>He hath chosen the Foolish, the Base, and despised Things of this World, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Wise, and Mighty.</hi> He will bow his Ear to thy Stammering Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; he will pick out the Meaning of thy inexpressible Groans; he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect thy weakest Offering, if there be in it but thy Heart: <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 29. <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 21. <hi>Prov.</hi> 9. 4, 5, 6. <hi>Isa.</hi> 38. 14, 15. <hi>Song</hi> 5. 16. <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 27. <hi>Mark</hi> 12 33, 34. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 11.</p>
               <p>Now, Is not this a Blessed Christ, Coming-Sinner? Art thou not like to fair well, when thou hast Embraced him, Coming-Sinner! But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly</hi> Thou hast yet another Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by Jesus Christ, that art com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him: For he is not only Full, but Free. He is not sparing of what he has; he is open hearted, and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handed. Let me in a few Particulars shew thee this:</p>
               <p>First, <hi>This is evident, because he calls thee;</hi> He calls upon thee, to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; the which he would not do,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:47254:148"/>
was he not <hi>Free</hi> to give: Yea, he bids thee, when come; <hi>Ask, Seek, Knock:</hi> And for thy Encouragement, adds to every Command, a Promise; <hi>Seek,</hi> and ye shall find; <hi>Ask,</hi> and ye shall have; <hi>Knock,</hi> and it shall be opened unto you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If the Rich Man should say thus to the Poor, would not he be reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Free-hearted Man? I say, Should he say to the Poor, <hi>Come</hi> to my Door, <hi>Ask</hi> at my Door, <hi>Knock</hi> at my Door, and you shall Find and Have; Would he not be counted Liberal? Why? thus doth Jesus Christ: Mind it, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-Sinner; <hi>Isa.</hi> 55. 3. <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 15. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>He doth not only bid thee Come, but tells thee, He will heartily do thee Good;</hi> Yea, he will do it with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing: <hi>I will rejoyce over them to do them Good, with my whole Heart, and with my whole Soul,</hi> Jer. 32. 41.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>It appeareth that he is</hi> Free, <hi>because he giveth without Twitting:</hi> He gives to all men Liberally, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth not; <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 5. There are some, that will not deny to do the Poor a Pleasure, but they will mix their Mercies with so many <hi>Twitts,</hi> that the Persons on whom they bestow
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:47254:148"/>
their Charity, shall find but little Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in it. But Christ doth not do so, Coming-Sinner; He casteth all thine Iniquities behind his Back; Thy Sins and Iniquities he will remember no more: <hi>Isa.</hi> 38. 17. <hi>Heb</hi> 8. 12.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That Christ is <hi>Free,</hi> is manifest by the Complaints that he makes against them, that will not come to him for Mercy: I say, he complains, saying; <hi>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem! How often would I have gathered thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren together, as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings, and ye would not?</hi> Matth. 23. 37. I say, he speaks it by way of Complaint. He saith al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in another place; <hi>But thou hast not called upon me, O</hi> Jacob; <hi>but thou hast been weary of me, O</hi> Israel; Isa. 43. 22. Coming-Sinner, See here the Willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Christ to Save; See here, how Free he is to communicate Life, and all good Things, to such as thou art? He complains, if thou comes not; he is displeased, if thou callest not upon him.</p>
               <p>Hark, Coming-Sinner, once again; When <hi>Jerusalem</hi> would not come to him for Safe-guard, <hi>He behold the City, and wept over it, saying; If thou hadst</hi>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:47254:149"/>
                  <hi>known, even thou, at least in this thy day, the Things that belong to thy Peace; but now they are hid from thine Eyes,</hi> Luk. 19. 41.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Lastly, <hi>He is open and</hi> Free Hearted to do thee Good, as is seen by the Joy and Rejoycing, that he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festeth at the coming home of poor <hi>Prodigals:</hi> He receives the lost Sheep with Rejoycing; the lost Groat with Rejoycing: Yea, when the Prodigal came home, what Joy and Mirth, what Musick and Dancing, was in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's House? <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Coming-Sinner, I will add another Encouragement for thy Help.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> God hath prepared a <hi>Mercy-Seat,</hi> a Throne of Grace <hi>to Sit on;</hi> that thou may'st come <hi>thither</hi> to him, and that he may <hi>from thence</hi> Hear thee, and Receive thee: <hi>I will Commune with thee</hi> (saith he) <hi>from above the Mercy-Seat,</hi> Exod. 25. 22.</p>
               <p>As who should say; Sinner, When thou comest to me, thou shalt find me upon the <hi>Mercy Seat;</hi> where also I am alwayes found of the Undone, Coming, Sinner: Thither I bring my Pardons; there I Hear, and Receive their Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Accept them to my Favour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> God hath also prepared a
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:47254:149"/>
                  <hi>Golden Altar</hi> for thee, to offer thy Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Tears upon: A <hi>Golden</hi> Altar! It is called a <hi>Golden</hi> Altar, to shew what Worth it is of in God's Account: For this Golden Altar, is Jesus Christ; This Altar sanctifies thy Gift, and makes thy Sacrifices acceptable. This Altar, then, makes thy Groans, <hi>Golden</hi> Groans; thy Tears, <hi>Golden</hi> Tears; and thy Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, <hi>Golden</hi> Prayers, in the Eye of that God thou comest to, Coming Sinner: <hi>Rev.</hi> 8. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 10, 15. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> God hath <hi>Strowed all the way</hi> (from the Gate of <hi>Hell,</hi> where thou wast, to the Gate of <hi>Heaven,</hi> whither thou art going,) <hi>with Flowers out of his own Garden:</hi> Behold! How the Promises, Invitations, Calls, and Encouragements, like Lillies, lye round about thee; (Take heed, that thou doest not tread them under foot, Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner!) With Promises, did I say? Yea, he hath mixed all those with his <hi>Own</hi> Name, his <hi>Sons</hi> Name; also, with the Name of Mercy, Goodness, Compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Love, Pity, Grace, Forgiveness, Pardon, and what not, that may encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the coming Sinner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He hath also, for thy En-couragement,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:47254:150"/>
laid up the Names, and set forth the Sins, of those that have been Saved: In his Book they are fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written, that thou through Patience, and Comfort of the Scriptures, mightst have Hope.</p>
               <p>1. In this book is Recorded <hi>Noah</hi>'s Name, and Sin; and how God had Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon him.</p>
               <p>2. In this Record is fairly written the Name of <hi>Lot,</hi> and the Nature of his Sin; and how the Lord had Mercy upon him.</p>
               <p>3. In this Record, thou hast also fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written, the Names of <hi>Moses, Aaron, Gidion, Sampson, David, Solomon, Peter, Paul;</hi> with the Nature of their Sins, and how God had Mercy upon them: And all to Encourage thee, Coming-Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I will add yet another En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, for the Man that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Jesus Christ. Art thou coming? Art thou coming, indeed? Why?</p>
               <p>1. Then this thy Coming, <hi>Is by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of God's Call.</hi> Thou art <hi>
                     <hi>Called;</hi> Calling</hi> goes before <hi>Coming:</hi> Coming is not of Works, but of him that <hi>Calleth. He went up into a Mountain, and called to him whom he would, and</hi> They <hi>came to him,</hi> Mark 3. 13.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Art thou coming? <hi>This is also by Vertue of Illumination.</hi> God has made thee see; and therefore, thou art coming. So long as thou wast Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, thou lovedst Darkness; and couldst not abide to come, because thy Deeds were Evil: But, being now Illuminated, and made to see, what, and where thou art; and also, what, and where thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour is: Now thou art coming to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ. <hi>Blessed art thou</hi> Simon Bar-Jona! <hi>for Flesh and Blood hath at Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it unto thee</hi> (said Christ) <hi>but my Father which is in Heaven;</hi> Matth. 16. 15, 16.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Art thou coming, <hi>this is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God has <hi>Inclined</hi>
                  </hi> thine heart to come; God hath called thee, illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thee, and <hi>inclined</hi> thy heart to come, and therefore thou comest to Jesus Christ. It is God that worketh in thee to <hi>Will,</hi> and to come to Jesus Christ. Coming sinner, bless God, for that he hath given thee a <hi>Will,</hi> to come to Jesus Christ. It is a Sign that thou belongest to Jesus Christ, because God has made thee <hi>willing</hi> to come to him, (<hi>Psal.</hi> 110. 3.) Bless God for <hi>slay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the enmity of thy mind; had <hi>he</hi> not done it, thou wouldest, <hi>as yet,</hi> have
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:47254:151"/>
hated thine own Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Art thou coming to Jesus Christ, <hi>it is God that giveth thee <hi>Power;</hi> power</hi> to pursue thy <hi>Will</hi> in the matters of thy Salvation, is the gift of God. 'Tis God that worketh in you both to <hi>Will</hi> and to <hi>
                     <hi>Do,</hi> Phil.</hi> 2. 13. not that God worketh <hi>Will</hi> to come, where he gives no <hi>power;</hi> but thou shouldest take notice, that <hi>power</hi> is an aditional Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. The Church saw that <hi>will</hi> and <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi> were two things, when She cried, <hi>Draw me, we will run after thee,</hi> (Song. 1. 4.): and so did <hi>David</hi> too, when he said, <hi>I will run the ways of thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, when thou shalt enlarge my Heart. Will</hi> to come, and <hi>power</hi> to pursue thy will, is a double Mercy, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> All thy strange, passionate, sudden rushings forward after Jesus Christ, (coming Sinners know what I mean) they also are thy helps from God. Perhaps thou feelest at sometimes, more than at others, strong stirrings up of heart, to fly to Jesus Christ; now thou hast at this time a sweet, and stiff gale of the Spirit of God filling thy sails with the fresh gales of his good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and thou ridest at those times, as
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:47254:151"/>
upon the wings of the wind, being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out beyond thy self, beyond the most of thy prayers, and also above all thy fears and temptations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> coming Sinner, hast thou not, now and then, a kiss of the sweet lips of Jesus Christ? I mean, some bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed word droping like an Honey-Comb upon thy Soul to revive thee, when thou art in the midst of thy dumps.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Does not Jesus Christ some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times give thee a glimps of himself, though perhaps, thou seest him not so long a time as while one may tell twenty?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Hast thou not sometimes as it were the very warmth of his wings over-shadowing the face of thy Soul, that gives thee as it were a gload up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy Spirit, as the bright beams of the Sun do upon thy body, when it sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly breaks out in the midst of a cloud, though presently all is gone again?</p>
               <p>Well, all these things are the good hand of thy God upon thee, and they are upon thee to constrain to provoke and to make thee willing, and able to come (coming Sinner) that thou mightest in the end be Saved.</p>
