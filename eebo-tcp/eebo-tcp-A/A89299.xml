            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">U</seg>Pon the third day of this preſent month <hi>September,</hi> a day not only remarkable for two notable &amp; famous Victories which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had over the <hi>Scots,</hi> the one at <hi>Dunbar,</hi> the other at <hi>Worceſter;</hi> but obſervable alſo, as to be the day appointed for the ſitting of this <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> between nine and ten of the clock at night, there was ſeen by <hi>Iames Cook</hi> Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, <hi>Thomas Bloſsome,</hi> and <hi>Edward See,</hi> all ſouldiers belonging to the Gariſon of <hi>Hull,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:167924:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 13 -->
this ſtrange and unwonted apparition.</p>
            <p>Theſe being (at the time before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) on the top of the <hi>North-Blockhouſe,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Watch according to order, on a ſudden the skie ſeemed to be of a fiery co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and to caſt forth many ſtreams. Whereupon, <hi>Thomas Bloſsome</hi> obſerving the ſtrangeneſs of the thing, began to tell the other two, how he had ſeen the very like appearance a little after the ſitting of the firſt <hi>Parliament;</hi> and after ſuch fiery ſtreams, a great Battel of horſe and foot appeared in the air. He had not ended his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but in the <hi>East</hi> appeared a huge Body of <hi>pike-men,</hi> ſeveral Parties marching before, as a <hi>Forlorn-hope.</hi> Never ſaw they in their lives an Army (to their thinking) in better equipage. Suddenly they beheld in the <hi>north-west</hi> another Army, the which ſeem'd unto them to march towards the <hi>Eastern</hi> Army with extraordinary ſpeed.</p>
            <p>And firſt, there was the repreſentation of ſome Skirmiſhes between Parties of each Army, as the <hi>Forlorn-hope.</hi> Afterwards both Bodies did engage, and furiouſly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:167924:3"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 13 -->
charged each other with their Pikes, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thorow one the other backwards and forward, in ſuch dreadful ſort, as the behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were aſtoniſhed thereat.</p>
            <p>Beſides, ſuch was the order of the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, as the <hi>Wings</hi> of each Army came in, to relieve their Bodies: And each had their <hi>Reſerves,</hi> who accordingly came in: ſo that for an half quarter of an hour, there was a moſt terrible Fight. But to their thinking, the Army which came from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> had the worſt.</p>
            <p>It is here to be noted, that both theſe Armies ſeemed to be of a <hi>Red</hi> colour.</p>
            <p>Within a little while, there appeared an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Army from the <hi>north-weſt,</hi> greater then the former, which marched directly to the place where the former Battel was fought.</p>
            <p>This Army was <hi>black:</hi> and here they perceived horſe as well as foot.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:167924:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 14 -->
And now begins another Battel far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the former for fierceneſs and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. From the <hi>black Army</hi> there went off Muskets and Cannons, inſomuch that they clearly diſcerned the fire and ſmoke thereof. This Battel was between the <hi>black</hi> and the <hi>Eastern red Army,</hi> being, as they apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the Reſerve of the former Army which came forth from the <hi>north-west.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe two Armies thus engaged, brake thorow one another, forward and back ward; but the <hi>black</hi> ſeemed ſtill to have the beſt.</p>
            <p>But before both <hi>Bodies</hi> met, there were ſeveral Skirmiſhes of <hi>Parties</hi> between the <hi>black</hi> and <hi>red,</hi> as in the former Battel. And when both Armies did encounter, they ſaw ſuch fire and ſmoak, as if a dozen Cannons had been diſcharged together.</p>
            <p>A little beneath theſe Armies, not far from the earth, upon a <hi>black cloud,</hi> appeared Horſe-men, and amongſt them they could perceive nothing, but riſing of fire and ſmoak, and a multitude of <hi>ſpears</hi> as it were ſtanding upright.</p>
            <p>This latter Battel continued a little
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:167924:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 14 -->
longer then the former, the <hi>black</hi> driving the <hi>red</hi> before them, till all the <hi>red</hi> vaniſhed out of their ſight. And the <hi>black</hi> remained; who in a little time after, departed, and were not any more ſeen of them.</p>
