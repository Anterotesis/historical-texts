            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

CASTELER: and the firſt of his love.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE lovely Maidens of the City of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi>
noting what a good husband <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard
Caſteler</hi> was, and ſéeing how dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
he followed his buſineſſe, judged
in the end he would prove a rich man: for
which many did beare unto him very
good affection, and few there were that
wiſhed not themſelves to be his Wife:
inſomuch that he having the cuſtome of all the pretty Wenches
in the City, by that means knew the length of every maids foot
ſo well, that he above all other beſt pleaſed them: on Sundays
when he came into the Church, the Maids eyes were ſo firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fixed on him, that he could neither look forward, backward,
nor on any ſide, but that he ſhould be ſure to have a winke of
one, a ſmile of another, the third would give him a nod: and to
be briefe, they would all caſt on him ſuch gracious looks, that it
was eaſie to gueſſe by their outward countenance, their inward
affections.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47292:7"/>
As he ſtood a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> at his cutting-boord, he ſhould be ſure to
have twenty curſies made him in an hour, by Maidens that paſt
up and down: ſome would beſtow on him dainty ſwéet noſegaies
of the faireſt flowers they could find, and otherſome would bring
handkerchers of Cambrick, and divers ſuch like favours; well
bewailing their friendſhip towards him.</p>
            <p>But among many that ſecretly affected him, I will only tell of
twaine, becauſe above all the reſt, their merriments do only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
in memory, the one of them was called <hi>Margaret</hi> of the
ſpread Eagle, but more commonly known by the name of long
<hi>Meg</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi> The other was a proper neat wench named
<hi>Gillian</hi> of the <hi>George,</hi> both of them as wily as they were witty,
and among all the Maids in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> were reputed to be the
beſt ſervants: having therefore good wages, they maintained
themſelves gallantly, and therewithall ſo honeſtly, that no man
could quip them with had living, though afterward it fell out o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
as in this Hiſtory you ſhall heare.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Margaret</hi> was a Maiden born in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> in height and
proportion of body, paſſing the ordinary ſtate of Women, but
there-withall very comely, &amp; of amiable countenance, her ſtrength
was agréeable to her ſtature, and her courage as great as them
both: ſhe was of quick capacity, and pleaſant diſpoſition, of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall
heart, and ſuch a one as would be ſuddainly angry, and
ſoon pleaſed, being ready to revenge her wrongs by weapons
then by words: and therein did ſhe differ from the nature of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
becauſe ſhe could not abide much babling. And albeit ſhe
manifeſted her good will by divers means, yet did <hi>Richard</hi> little
regard it, having his mind nothing bent unto marriage, by means
whereof <hi>Margaret</hi> grew into ſuch ſad conceits as changed her
cherry chéeks into a gréen wan countenance, inſomuch that every
one wondred to ſée her penſiveneſſe.</p>
            <p>Nay ſaid <hi>Gillian,</hi> if that be all, I am at a good point, for though
my maiden head be ſomwhat burthenſom to bear, yet I had rather
kéep it, then beſtow it on a bad Husband, but though I ſay it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I be but a poore wench, I have choiſe of huſbands, enough
and ſuch as I am aſſured in my conſcience, would both love me
well, and kéep me gallantly. Wherefore then doe you not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
qd. <hi>Margaret?</hi> in my opinion it is the moſt pleaſing'ſt life
<pb facs="tcp:47292:7"/>
that may be: when a woman ſhall have her Husband come and
ſay to her in this ſort: How now Wife? how doſt Swéet-heart?
what wilt thou have? Wilt thou have a cup of White-wine,
or Sack, and if there be one good bit better then another,
ſhe ſhall be ſure to have it. At laſt having well refreſht them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
ſhe puts her ſilver whiſtle to her mouth, and calls her
maid to clear the board: then going to the fire he ſets her on his
knée, ſtroaking her chéek, checks her under the chin, fetching
many kiſſes at her rubie lips, and ſo ſoon as he hears the bell ring
eight a clock he calls her to go to bed with him. But when they
are once cloſe betwéen a paire of ſhéets, O <hi>Gillian</hi> then, then:
why what of that qd. ſhe? Nay nothing ſays <hi>Margaret,</hi> but they
ſléep ſoundly all night. Truly qd. <hi>Gillian</hi> there be many wives,
but few that méet with ſuch kind Husbands: But ſéeing you
ask me why I marry not, in troth <hi>Meg</hi> I would tell thée, if I had
time to ſtay, and therefore farewell good <hi>Meg,</hi> when I ſée thée
again, thou ſhalt know more of my mind.</p>
            <p>Nay <hi>Gillian</hi> hear you qd. ſhe, go but a little way with me,
and I will go home with you, for I have nothing to buy but a
a ſcore of Quinces, and a couple of Pomegranets: <hi>Gillian</hi> was
contented to ſtay a while, and as ſoon as <hi>Margaret</hi> had made her
market, they went homeward, where by the way <hi>Gillian</hi> entred
into this communication.</p>
            <p>You did even now demand a queſtion of me, and very deſirous
you were to know why I did not marry when I was ſo well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred;
Truſt me <hi>Margaret</hi> I take you to be my friend, which
makes me the more willing to unfold my fancy; And truth it is
that I have forſaken good matches, for I might have had Maſter
<hi>Cornelius</hi> of the Guard if I would, who as you know is weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
yet there was one thing made me to refuſe his kind proffer:
what was that qd. <hi>Margaret,</hi> I pray thée tell? Quoth ſhe, he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
me not ſo well, but I loved another ten times better and
therefore it is not good for hands to joyn where hearts agrée
not. No <hi>Meg</hi> no, there is a youth in our ſtréet that nearer
touches my heart, and better pleaſes my mind: for it is an old
Proverb, two may kéep counſel if one be away, Nay then quoth
<hi>Meg.</hi> if you dare not truſt me, tell me no further notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I have had credit in as great a matter as yeurs, for many a

that thou wilt never bewrey, nor prevent me in my love, and I
will ſhew thée all: nay fie do not ſo qd. <hi>Margaret,</hi> ſhew not all
for ſhame, left more ſée it then my ſelf, for ſo may they bluſh at
thy boldneſſe: no truſt me qd. <hi>Gillian,</hi> for ſuch a one as cannot
kéep her Maiden-head, will never keep a ſecret, and that made
<hi>Katherine</hi> of the <hi>Crane</hi> to be ſuch a blab: but now <hi>Meg</hi> I will
procéed to the matter. What do you think by <hi>Richard</hi> of the
<hi>Roſe,</hi> who is up ſo early every morning, that he is called the
wakefull cock of <hi>Weſminſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh ho qd. <hi>Meg</hi> is that the man? there is no reaſon I ſhould
think amiſſe of him that every man commends: nevertheleſſe, he
is no body in reſpect of riches, nothing comparable to <hi>Cornelius.</hi>
I will tell thée what qd. <hi>Gillian,</hi> that man which néedeth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to flatter with friends, nor borrow of his neighbours,
hath riches ſufficient: and he is moſt poore that hath leaſt wit,
by which arguments I am able to prove, that this Tock is as
wealthy as wary, for he will ſure be beholding to no body, or
to as few as may be, and it is alwaies to be noted, that men of
ſuch minds do never prove beggers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Margaret</hi> hearing <hi>Gillian</hi> ſo ſtoutly to to take <hi>Richards</hi> part,
perceived by her vehement ſpéeches, the great affection ſhe bore
to him, and finding that ſhe was ſick of her own diſeaſe, <hi>Marga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi>
ſought means to remove the cauſe of her griefe: And the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy
ſhe uſed moſt herein, was to ſpeak altogether in <hi>Richards</hi>
diſpraiſe, and the more firmly to plant her own affectio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n,
whereupon ſhe uttered her mind in this ſort.</p>
            <p>Well <hi>Gillian,</hi> ſéeing you hear ſo good an opinion of <hi>Richard</hi> of
the <hi>Roſe,</hi> I would not for a buſhel of Angels ſéek to diſwade
you: but becauſe you requeſt my opinion how I like the man, in
rotth I will tell thée my mind without flattery: I confeſſe that
<hi>Richard</hi> is a gentle young man, courteous and kind, diligent
about his buſineſſe, and wary in his dealings, which argues
good husbandry. Notwithſtanding, I like not theſe over co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
fellows, of ſuch gréedy minds; Tell me I pray thée
<pb facs="tcp:47292:8"/>
what joy ſhould a woman have with ſuch a churle, that would
grudge at every halfe-penny that is laid out: That in a whole
year would not leave a farthing worth of muſtard unwritten
in his book. And ſuch a one I feare will this Cock prove, for
me thinks he looks with a hungry noſe, and howſoever you think
of him. I know not, but I verily fear, though he be a Cock by
name, he will never prove a Cock of the game. Againe, he is
but a dwarfe in reſpect of a man, a ſhrimp, a wren, a hop of my
thumb, ſuch a one as a body may hide in a wrinkle of their but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocks.</p>
            <p>Well <hi>Meg</hi> quoth ſhe, you are priviledged to ſpeak your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
but ſhould another thus mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>earme him, I would teare her
face: I tell thée true, I had rather have a winner then waſter,
a ſparer then a prodigall ſpender: for when a man in his youth
hath gotten ſomething with pain, he may better ſpend it in his
age with pleaſure, and far better he ſhould be thought covetous,
then careleſſe: his ſtature and proportion of body pleaſes me
well enough, for it is no matter how great he is, but how good
he is.</p>
            <p>But <hi>Margaret</hi> ſéeing our talke hath indured ſo long, that it
hath brought us home, let us at our parting be mindfull of our
promiſes, to kéep ſecret whatſoever hath béen ſaid, for little
knows the young man the depth of my mind, and therefore would
I kéep it cloſe, till I ſaw ſome ſigne of good will procéeding from
him, for it becometh not maidens to be woers, though willingly
they could wiſh to wed where they beſt fancy, and ſo farewell

our next méeting, when I hope I ſhall further underſtand of
procéedings in your love.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Meg</hi> had thus underſtood her mind, and ſaw how the

            <head>CHAP. II. How Margaret requeſted Richard to the eating of a poſſet at
night, and how her Maſters buttocks was ſcalded therewith.</head>
            <p>IT chanced that againſt Whitſentide, <hi>Margaret</hi> ſtood in néed
of a new paire of ſhooes: therefore in a morning betimes ſhe
came to <hi>Richard</hi> of the Roſe to beſpeak them aforehand, and
the more to declare her kindneſſe, and to win his good will,
ſhe carryed with her a bottle of excellent good Muskadine, which
a Yeoman of the Kings wine-ſellor beſtowed upon her, ſhe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
with her a dainty péece of powdred béefe, and the carkaſſe of
a cold Capon, and thus began to gréet him. All health to the
kind cock of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> that with the Larke gréetes the Sun
riſing with a chearfull note: Tell me quoth ſhe thou bonny Lad,
wilt thou take the length of my foot, and make me a good paire
of ſhooes againſt Sunday? that I will <hi>Margaret</hi> quoth he, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let me ſée thy foot: there is both my foot and leg ſaid <hi>Meg,</hi> I
am not aſhamed to ſhew either of them for I am not legged like
a Craue, nor footed like a Flie, and therewith ſhe did lift up her
cloathes to her knée, whereat <hi>Richard</hi> ſmiling ſaid, a little high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<hi>Meg</hi> and ſhew all: whereupon ſhe ſuddainly replyed in this
ſort: ſoft <hi>Richard</hi> not ſo, for I will tell thée one thing,
<q>
                  <l>Every Carter may reach to the garter,</l>
                  <l>A Shoomaker may reach to the knee,</l>
                  <l>But he that creeps higher ſhall ask leave of me.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Good reaſon qd. <hi>Richard,</hi> leave is light, which being obtained
a man may be bold without offence, but this onely is my griefe.
I have never a laſt long enough for thy foot: then I would they
were all fired qd. <hi>Meg.</hi> He that would be counted a good work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
will have tools to fit all perſons: Fie <hi>Richard</hi> fie, thou
ſhouldeſt never be unprovided, eſpecially for women.</p>
            <p>Well <hi>Meg</hi> qd. he, be contented, conſider you are a Woman of
no ordinary making, but as in height thou overlookeſt all, ſo in
the length of thy foot thou ſurpaſſeſt all: therefore I muſt have a
pair of Laſts made for the nonce, and that ſhall be done out of
hand: I tell thée <hi>Dick</hi> qd. ſhe, as high as I am, I am no ſo high
<pb facs="tcp:47292:9"/>
as <hi>Pauls,</hi> nor is my foot ſo long as <hi>Graves-end</hi> Farge. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
qd. <hi>Richard,</hi> a paire of Laſts to fit thy foot will
coſt as much as a hundred of wooden faggots, which will not be
bought for ten groats: if they coſt a crown qd. <hi>Meg,</hi> let me have
them; I love not to pinch for a penny, if I find my ſhooes good,
I will not ſhrink for a ſhilling: In troth qd. <hi>Richard,</hi> franke cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomers
are worthy of good ware, and therefore <hi>Meg</hi> doubt not,
for thou ſhalt have as good a ſhooe as ever was drawn upon a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
foot: Godamercy for that ſwéet <hi>Dicke</hi> qd. ſhe, and ſéeing
thou ſayſt ſo, I will beſtow this bottle of wine on thée to break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt,
and therewithall ſhe pluckt out her powdred béef and her
cold Capon; <hi>Richard</hi> ſéeing this, with thanks to <hi>Margaret</hi> for
meat, reacht out a couple of joynt ſtooles, and after that they had
laid a cloth therern, they down did fit, at which time many mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſpéeches did paſſe betwéen them. And at that very time there
was in the ſame ſhop, amongſt a great many other men, a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
Iourney-man cal'd round <hi>Robbin,</hi> being a well truſt fellow,
ſhort and thick, yet very active and pleaſantly conceited: for
ſinging he was held in high reputation among all the ſhoomakers
in <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> This jolly companion ſéeing them both ſo well
at their breakfaſt, and nothing at all to reſpect him in the place
where he ſate, caſt out theſe merry ſpéeches unto them.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Much good doe it you Maſters, and well may you faire,</l>
               <l>Beſhroe both your hearts and if you doe ſpare,</l>

            </q>
            <p>With that <hi>Margaret</hi> filling a cup brim full, gave it into his
hands, ſaying, now taſt it <hi>Robin</hi> and take there the cup: <hi>Nay
hang me quoth Robin if I drink it not up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By my Maiden-head quoth <hi>Margaret,</hi> I ſée that thou art a

You were a maid at three years old.</l>

            <p>Now by my honeſty qd. <hi>Meg</hi> you do me mighty wrong to

It may be ſhe hath qd. <hi>Margaret</hi> but whether ſhe did or no it

your welcome ſhall be great: I will have as good a Poſſet for

quoth <hi>Margaret,</hi> it is not ſuch a matter, therefore ſwéet
<hi>Richard</hi> you ſhall come, and forget not to bring round <hi>Robin</hi>

I thank long <hi>Meg,</hi> we have béen at it this morning, and
had you come a little ſooner, you had found her here, for ſhe went

to grow jealous of the matter: out upon her foule ſtammell
quoth ſhe, he that takes her to his wife, ſhall be ſure of fleſh
enough, let him get bread were he can. Notwithſtanding this,
I will tell you <hi>Richard,</hi> the leſſe ſhe come into your company,
the more it will be for your credit. And howſoever ſhe deſerves
it, God knows, I cannot accuſe her, but I promiſe you, ſhe
hath but a hard report amongſt many. But let her reſt as ſhe
is: ſée here what I have brought you, and with that ſhe gave
him the Veniſon and the reſt, and drawing her purſe, ſhe would
needs ſond for a quart of wine, <hi>Richard</hi> ſought to perſwade her
to the contrary, but ſhe would not: what man qd. ſhe, I am able
to give you a quart of wine: That's ſpoke like an Angell quoth
<hi>Robin;</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>And this <hi>I</hi> do think,</l>
                  <l>If you be able to give it, we be able to drink.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon the Wine was fetcht, and ſo they ſate them down
and fed heartily on the Veniſon Paſty, and <hi>Gillians</hi> eye fed as
gréedily on <hi>Richards</hi> favour: and as ſoon as the wine was come,
ſhe pluckt out of her pocket a good péece of Sugar, and filling
a glaſſe of wine tempered well therewith, ſhe drank to him,
ſaying, here <hi>Richard,</hi> to all that love you and me, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to him whom I love beſt: qd. <hi>Richard,</hi> I will pledge him
whoſoever it be.</p>
            <q>
               <l>So will I quoth Robin without any faile,</l>
               <l>Were it the beſt Hipocras, I would turn it over my naile.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Then <hi>Gillian</hi> looking round about, ſpoke to this effect: verily
<hi>Richard</hi> here is a pretty houſe, and every thing hanſome by
Saint <hi>Anne,</hi> I ſée nothing wanting but a good Wife to kéep
all things in his due kind: whereunto <hi>Kobin</hi> made this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>

            <q>
               <l>Now ſpeak thy conſcience, and tell me good Gill,</l>
               <l>Wouldſt not thou be that good wife, with a good will?</l>
            </q>
            <p>Who I? alas quoth ſhe, your Maſter ſcornes me, he looks for
a girle with gold, one that might bring him the red ruddocks
chinking in a bag: and yet he were better to have one with leſſe
money and more huſwifery: for my one part, I would not come
to learn of never a Woman in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> how to deal in ſuch
affairs: I think no leſſe quoth <hi>Richard,</hi> and therefore I pray
God ſend you a good Husband, and one well deſerving ſo good
a wife: with that <hi>Gillian</hi> fetcht a great ſigh, ſaying, Amen I
pray God. Why then marry me qd. <hi>Robin,</hi> and thereby prevent
the periſh of bad thoughts, hark in thy ear <hi>Robin</hi> quoth ſhe, I
would thy Maſter would ſay ſo much and then he ſhould ſoon
know my mind.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Ha, ha, quoth Robin, <hi>I</hi> faith you drab,</l>
               <l>And would you have him to ſtamp the crab.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Why what is the matter quoth <hi>Richard?</hi> nay nothing (quoth
<hi>Gillian)</hi> but that I was bold to jeſt with your man, and I hope
you will not be offended if he and I talk a word or two. There
is no reaſon I ſhould, quoth <hi>Richard,</hi> &amp; therefore confer at your
pleaſure, and the whilſt I will be buſie with the Lamb-pye, then
<hi>Gillian</hi> whiſpering <hi>Robin</hi> in the ear, ſpoke in this ſort unto him.
I perceive you can ſpy day at a little hole. <hi>Robin</hi> I am of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that affection groweth as ſtrong in a woman as a man, they
to have equall priviledge, as well as men to ſpeak their minds:
In truth <hi>Robin</hi> to be plain, I love thy Maſter with all my heart,
and if thou wouldſt be ſo much my friend to break the matter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, and therewithall to procure his good likeing unto me, I
would beſtow on thée as good a ſute of apparrell, as ever thou
waſt Maſter of in thy life, whereunto <hi>Robin</hi> anſwered, ſaying.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Here's my hand Gillian, at thy requeſt,</l>
               <l>Ile make a vow Ile do my beſt,</l>
               <l>But for my apparell grant me this,</l>

            <p>There it is, qd. <hi>Gillian</hi> and I do proteſt, that upon that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
day, when he gives his happy conſent to be my husband, at
the delivery of thy apparell, I will make that one kiſſe twenty,
and they came to the table, and ſet them down again. <hi>Richard</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:47292:12"/>
marking all, ſaid nothing, but at her approach to the board, tooke
the glaſſe and drunk to her, giving her thanks for her coſt and
kindneſſe: ſhe gladly accepting the ſame, bending her body in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of curſie, took it at his hands, and drunk unto <hi>Robin,</hi> and
ſo taking her leave of them both ſhh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ran ſpéedily home.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as ſhe was gone, <hi>Robin</hi> told his Maſter it was the
pleaſenteſt life in the world to live a Batchelor, for he would
never want good chéer and company: I marry quoth <hi>Richard,</hi>
but what I get one way I ſpend another: you ſée quoth he here
is a foreneoon ſpent to no purpoſe. I tell thée <hi>Robin,</hi> I account
their inticoments dangerous, therefore a man muſt not be won
with fair words as a fiſh with a bait.</p>
            <p>Well quoth <hi>Robin,</hi> all is one to me, whether you love or
loath them, but let not the poſſet be forgot ſoon at night.</p>
            <p>Quoth <hi>Richard,</hi> if I reſt in the mind I am in now, I mean
not to be there at all: then you will loſe her love quoth <hi>Robin,</hi>
that, ſaid his Maſter is that I deſire, for the love of a Shroe is
like the ſhadow of a cloud that ſoon conſumeth, and ſuch love is
better loſt then found. Quoth <hi>Robin,</hi> this once follow my mind,

                  <l>Though by her love you ſet but light,</l>

                  <l>Yet think themſelves well pleas'd the while.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Verily quoth his Maſter, if thou wilt do ſo. I will be <hi>Megs</hi>
gueſt this once, and think my ſelf happy to be ſo rid of them:
Hereupon <hi>Richard</hi> having his Shop windows ſhut in and his

to the Spread Eagle, where they no ſooner knockt at the doore,

            <p>Herewithall <hi>Margaret</hi> very neatly laid the cloth, ſet a dainty

                  <l>Therefore you ſhal not know it though you were my mother</l>
                  <l>Yet thus much by thy ſpeech <hi>I</hi> plainly do ſee,</l>
                  <l>Thou thinkſt not ſo well of him as he thinks on thee.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Margaret</hi> hearing round <hi>Robin</hi> rime to ſo good a purpoſe; asked
<pb facs="tcp:47292:13"/>
if he knew his Maſters mind ſo much? therefore ſwéet <hi>Robin</hi>
let me know whereupon thou ſpeakeſt. Hereupon <hi>Robin</hi> ſaid,
that his Maſter was very well affected towards her, and that if it
were not for <hi>Gillian</hi> of the <hi>George,</hi> he would long ere this have
uttered his mind to you: but quoth <hi>Robin,</hi> he is ſe haunted by
that female ſpirit, that he can reſt in no place for her.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Words uttered</hi> by <hi>Robin,</hi> made <hi>Margarets</hi> heart leap
in her belly: wherefore taking gentlely her leave of him, ſhe
thus began to meditate on the matter: Now do I well ſée that
the tongue of a wiſe man is in his heart, but the heart of a foole
is in his tongue: and <hi>Richard</hi> quoth ſhe haſt thou born me ſuch
ſecret good will and would never let me know it.</p>
            <p>Thus in a jolly humor <hi>Margaret</hi> jotted home, flatterring her
ſelf in her happy fortune, in which delight we will leave her and
make ſome rehearſeall of <hi>Gillians</hi> joy: who coming in the like
manner to <hi>Robin,</hi> asking for his Maſter, was certified by him,
that for her ſake only he lived in ſuch ſorrow, that he could not
ſtay in his ſhop, and therefore was faine to drive away melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly
by marching abroad. O <hi>Gillian</hi> quoth he, had it not béen
for two cauſes, he would long ere this have uttered his mind to
thée: quoth <hi>Gillian,</hi> is it true <hi>Robin</hi> that thou doſt tell me? doubt
not of that, do you think I will tell you a lye? Nay good <hi>Robin</hi>
be not angry, blame me not to aske a queſtion: ask what you
will quoth <hi>Robin,</hi> and I may chuſe whether I will anſwer you
or no: now I have opened my Maſter ſecret, you were beſt to
blab it through all the town. Nay good <hi>Robin</hi> that is not my
mind quoth <hi>Gillian,</hi> but I beſéech thée let me know thoſe two
cauſes that kéeps thy Maſter from uttering his mind. Nay ſoft,
there lay a ſtaw for fear of ſtumbling quoth <hi>Robin,</hi> let it ſuffice
you that you know what you know. Nay good ſwéet <hi>Robin</hi> I
pray thée make it not dainty now to tell me all, ſéeing you have
begun; the day may come that I may requite thy courteſie: ſay
you ſo <hi>Gillian?</hi> now by good <hi>Criſpianus,</hi> were it not that I am
in hope you would prove kind to my Maſter, and be a good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris
to us, I would not utter one word more. Well <hi>Robin,</hi>
if ever I come to command thy Maſters houſe, and kéep the keys,
thou ſhalt ſée I will kéep no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iggards table, but you ſhall have
meat and drink in a plentifull manner.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:47292:14"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Robin</hi> hearing this, told her this tale, that his Maſter loved
her intirely, and would long ſince have uttered his mind, but
for two reaſons: the firſt was that he could never find a fit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
becauſe of long <hi>Meg,</hi> whoſe love to him was more
then he could wiſh: for if he do but ſpeak, and look upon any, <hi>ſhe</hi>
preſently pouts and lowers, which is ſuch a grief to my Maſter,
that he is faine to kéep ſilent. The ſecond reaſon is, that he is
not wealthy as he could wiſh himſelf, you would diſdain his ſuit:
Who I quoth <hi>Gillian?</hi> I tell thée <hi>Robin</hi> I do more reſpect his
kindneſſe then his goods. Why then good <hi>Gillian</hi> quoth <hi>Robin,</hi>
hearken hither thrée dayes hence, and you ſhall hear more. I
warrant thée <hi>Robin</hi> quoth ſhe, and ſo away ſhe went, being as
glad of this tidings as her Maſter was of a good Term. Now
when his Maſter came home, <hi>Robin</hi> asked him how he ſped in
his ſuit, even as Cooks do in baking their Pyes, ſometimes wel,
ſometimes ill. <hi>London</hi> Wenches are wily Laſſes; Now
ſhe is in one mind, by and by in another, and to be brief never
ſtedfaſt in any thing.</p>
            <p>Tuſh Maſter quoth <hi>Robin,</hi> ſtoop not to a Thiſtle, take this
comfort, what one will not, another will: I tell you Maſter,
theſe nice Minions are ſo full of curioſit, that they are cleane
without courteſie: Yet well fare the gallant girls of <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
that will do more for a man then he will do for himſelf.
What is that ſaid his Maſter? mary quoth he to give two kiſſes
before he calls for one. That indéed is extraordinary kindneſſe
quoth <hi>Richard,</hi> but their loves is like braided Wares, that is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
ſéen, but hardly ſold.</p>
            <p>Well Maſter quoth <hi>Robin,</hi> you know your two old friends
<hi>Meg</hi> and <hi>Gillian:</hi> I, what of them quoth <hi>Richard?</hi> I have
made them both beléeve that you love them out of all cry. And
I beſhrow thy heart for that qd. <hi>Richard,</hi> for therein thou doſt
both deceive them, and diſcredit me: I aſſure thée I like not
ſuch jeſting.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Now gip quoth Robin, are you griev'd at my talk?</l>
               <l>And if you be angry, <hi>I</hi> pray go walk:</l>
               <l>Thus do you never eſteem of a man,</l>
               <l>Let him do for you the beſt that he can.</l>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard</hi> hearing his man ſo hot, pacified him with many cold
<pb facs="tcp:47292:14"/>
and gentle ſpeeches, wiſhing if he had begun any jeſt, that he
ſhould finiſh it with ſuch diſcretion, that no reproach might
grow upon him, whereupon <hi>Robin</hi> proceeded in this ſort.</p>
            <p>Vpon a time <hi>Margaret</hi> according to her wonted manner came
thither, whom <hi>Robin</hi> peſwaded that his Maſter was go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e into
<hi>Tutle fields,</hi> and he deſired you that you would meet him there:
but take heed that <hi>Gillian</hi> of the George ſpye you, and ſo follow
you to the place where my Maſter attends your coming. Tuſh
quoth <hi>Margaret,</hi> let me alone for that, if ſhe follow me ſhe were
better no, for I will lead her a dance ſhall maker her weary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe hath done, and ſo farewell <hi>Robin:</hi> for into <hi>Tutle</hi> fields I
will trudge as faſt as I may. <hi>But take heed you looſe not your
maiden-head by the way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Robin</hi> preſently runs unto <hi>Gillian,</hi> ſaying what chéere <hi>Gilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
how does all the pretty Wenches here? I faith <hi>Robin</hi> qd.
they, we rub out with the reſt: but what is the news with thée?
<q>
                  <l>Small news quoth Robin, yet ſomewhat I have to ſay,</l>
                  <l>But hear you Gillian a word by the way.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And with that (rounding her in the eare) he told her that inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
it was his Maſters will ſhe ſhould méet him in <hi>Tutle</hi> filds:
charging her if ſhe met <hi>Margaret</hi> ſhe ſhould in no caſe go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
for my Maſter cannot abide that great rounſefull ſhould
come in his company.</p>
            <p>For that let me alone quoth <hi>Gillian,</hi> but truſt me <hi>Robin,</hi>
it could not have come in a worſe time this twelve moneth: why
then let it reſt till another time quoth <hi>Robin:</hi> nay quoth ſhe, I
will go to him, ſith ſo kindly he ſent for me; into <hi>Tutle fields</hi>
ſhe goes, where at laſt ſhe ſpied <hi>Margaret</hi> with a hand-basket in
her hand, who ſuddainly had got a ſight of her, ſhe made a ſhew
as if ſhe gathered hearbs in the field: quoth <hi>Gillian</hi> I will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hearbs as faſt as you, though I have as little néed of them as
your ſelf.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Robin</hi> got him home, and hartily laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at them, ſaying O what a World is this, when maids runs
a madding for husbands? now may I ſweare what I have ſéen.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Two maids run as faſt as they can,</l>
               <l>
                  <hi>A</hi> mile in the field to meet with a man.</l>
            </q>
            <p>How can men ſay maids are proud, or coy, when we find them
<pb facs="tcp:47292:15"/>
ſo gentle, that they will run like a Falcon to the Lure: but alas
they are deceived in finding <hi>Richard</hi> in <hi>Turtle fields:</hi> but hereby
I know their minds againſt another time.</p>
            <p>Thus did <hi>Robin</hi> deride them when he found their fondneſſe to
be ſuch: but to leave him to his humor, and return to the maids
that were picking hearbs in the fields: when <hi>Meg</hi> ſaw that <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
would not away, <hi>ſhe</hi> came to her, and askt her what ſhe did
there? nay what do you here quoth ſhe? quoth <hi>Meg</hi> I come to
gather thrift, but I can find nothing but thiſtles: quoth <hi>Gillian</hi>
but I mean to get hearts-eaſe ere I goe: Nay quoth <hi>Meg</hi> I
ſhall find thrift, as ſoon as you ſhall find heart-eaſe, but I think
I ſhall find none to day, then get you home quoth <hi>Gillian,</hi> would
you be rid of my company qd. <hi>Meg?</hi> for that word I mean not to
be gon yet: I faith <hi>Gillian</hi> I ſmell a Rat. Then quoth ſhe you
have as good a noſe as our gray Cat: but what Rat do you ſmell
tell me? I doubt, if there be any Rat in the field, you would fain
catch him in your trap, but I faith <hi>Meg</hi> you ſhall be deceiv'd: then
qd. <hi>Meg</hi> you would have the Rat taſte no chéeſe but your own;
then ſaid <hi>Gillian,</hi> whereſoever he run, I would have him créep
into no corner of yours: you ſpeak myſticall quoth <hi>Meg:</hi> if thou
art a good Wench let's go home together: quoth <hi>Gillian,</hi> as I
came not with you, ſo I mean not to go with you.</p>
            <p>Quoth <hi>Meg</hi> before God I will ſtay as long as thée for thy life:
quoth <hi>Gillian</hi> thou ſhalt ſtay while midnight then: and in this
humor ſometimes they ſate down, ſometimes they ſtalkt round
the fields, till it was night, and at laſt the Watch met with them,
who contrary to <hi>Gillians</hi> mind, brought them home together.
But their Miſtreſſes that had ſo long miſt them, were very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
with their long abſence, yet were glad they were come again;
and asking where they had béen ſo long, the Watchmen an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that the one had béen to ſéek hearts-eaſe, and the other
to gather thrif. Nay quoth their Miſtriſſes if that be the reaſon,
we cannot much blame them, ſéeing we have ſought it this ſeven
years and could not find it: and in this ſort the jeſt ended.</p>
            <p>Within a while after, <hi>Richard</hi> through his long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

or it, who coming unto <hi>Richard,</hi> ſaying he was the moſt falſe
<pb facs="tcp:47292:15"/>
and unconſtant man in the World. Have I qd. <hi>Meg,</hi> ſet my
whole mind on thée to be thus ſerved? Nay quoth <hi>Gillian,</hi> have
I indured ſuch ſorrow for thy ſake, and be thus unkindly caſt
off? Now I wiſh from my heart quoth <hi>Meg,</hi> that if ever thou
marrieſt any out me, that ſhe may make thée as errant a Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kold
as <hi>Jack Coomes.</hi> So, you are very charitable quoth <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi>
to with me no worſe then you mean to make your Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:
but when did I requeſt thée to come into <hi>Tuttle fields?</hi>
What have you ſo weak a memory quoth ſhe? ask your man
<hi>Robin</hi> whether it were ſo or no: Well quoth <hi>Robin</hi> what then?
wherefore did you not ſpeak with him at that preſent?</p>
            <q>
               <l>You know it comes in an hour, comes not in ſeven year,</l>
               <l>Had you met him at that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ant you had married him clear.</l>
            </q>
            <p>A vengeance take her quoth <hi>Meg,</hi> I could not méet him for
<hi>Gillian.</hi> I could not méet him for <hi>Meg,</hi> a morin take her quoth
<hi>Gillian. Richard</hi> hearing them at words, made this reply. It
is a ſtrange thing that you will blame me of diſcourteſie: had
you come at the appointed time, it is likely I had married one
of you, ſéeing my mind was adieted to one as well as the other::
Why may it not be yet quoth they? No ſaid he, you ſpeak too
late: hearing this anſwer they were ſtruck with grief, and ſo
with watry eyes went home, to whom <hi>Robin</hi> carried two Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Garlands, ſaying; You prety ſouls that forſaken be,
<q>
                  <l>Take here the branhces of the willow tree.</l>
                  <l>And ſing loves farewell joyntly with me.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Meg</hi> being merrily inclined, ſhook off ſorrow in this ſort, and
taking the Willow Garland, ſaid, Wherefore is grief good? can
it recall folly paſt? no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and therefore a fig for the Cock of <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtminſter;</hi>
Now God bleſſe me, I ſwear by <hi>Venus,</hi> that in the
mind I am in, I would not have him, if he had as much money
as would lye in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> Hall. And therefore <hi>Robin</hi> this
Willow Garland is to me right welcome: and now I will goe
with thee to <hi>Gillian,</hi> but when they came to <hi>Gillian, Robin</hi> ſtaid
for her at the ſtair foot: they found her ſick in her bed, to whom
<hi>Margaret</hi> ſpake in this manner. What how now <hi>Gillian</hi> ſick a
bed? now fie for ſhame, let not a man thiumph ſo much over thée,
as to ſay thou gav'ſt the Crow a pudding. Ah no quoth <hi>Gilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi>
death is ſwéet to them that live in ſorrow, but to none ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:47292:16"/>
be better welcome then to me. What now quoth <hi>Margaret,</hi>
whoſe Mare is dead? Art thou a young Wench, fair and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and doth thou deſpaire of life: and all for love? O quoth <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi>
what are all the men in the world to me now I have loſt
my <hi>Richard.</hi> Riſe quoth <hi>Meg,</hi> come lets go drink a quart of
Sack to waſh down ſorrow. O quoth <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I might have all the World. What if your Father or Mother,
or ſome of the Kings Gentlemen intreat you, would you not riſe,
never prate, I would not riſe to the beſt Lord in the Land, nor to
no man elſe: nay qd. <hi>Meg</hi> I am ſure you would: If I do, ſay I
am an errant quean. Nay qd. <hi>Meg,</hi> ſéeing you ſay ſo, I have
done, and therefore Ile kéep my breath to cool my pottage.</p>
            <p>A matter ſaid <hi>Gillian?</hi> what matter is it ſwéet <hi>Meg,</hi> tell me?
no quoth ſhe, tis but but a trifle, your ſwéet heart <hi>Richard</hi> hath
ſent his man <hi>Robin</hi> for you, and he tells me he hath a token to
deliver to you: quoth <hi>Gill,</hi> where is he, why comes he not up?
quoth <hi>Meg,</hi> he counts it more then manners to preſſe into a mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
chamber. O ſtay a little good <hi>Meg</hi> and I will go along
with you, and with that, on ſhe ſlipt her Petticote, and would
not ſtay the puptting on her ſtockings or her ſhooes: why how
now <hi>Gillian</hi> quoth <hi>Meg,</hi> have you fogot your ſelf? remember
you are ſick a bed: tuſh 'tis no matter for that ſaid <hi>Gillian,</hi>
grief hath too tongues, to ſay, and unſay: and ſo ſhe ran down
the ſtairs after <hi>Margaret,</hi> who got <hi>Robin</hi> to go before to the
thrée Tuns, who when <hi>Gillian</hi> came, ſhe asked him how his
Maſter did, and what his errand was to her.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Soft, firſt let us drink quoth Robin, and then let us talk,</l>
               <l>That we cannot pay for, ſhall be ſet up in chalk.</l>
            </q>
            <p>You ſpeak merrily quoth <hi>Margaret,</hi> but I wiſh I could ſée the
Wine come once, that I may drink a hearty draught: for ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
they ſay is dry, and I find it to be true,
<q>Then drink hard quoth Robin and bid ſorrow adue.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus when they had whipt off two or three quarts, <hi>Gillian</hi>
began to grow as pleaſant as the beſt, and would know of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin</hi>
what he had to ſay to her: nothing qd. he but to do my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
commendation, &amp; to deliver you his token. This token qd.
ſhe, what a Willow Gar land? is this the beſt reward he can
give me for my good will: had he no body to flout but me. O
<pb facs="tcp:47292:16"/>
intollerable injury quoth <hi>Gillian,</hi> did I take pains to riſe out of
my warm bed for this? Well <hi>Margaret</hi> if you will agrèe, we
will wear theſe diſdainfull branches on his marriage day to his
great diſgrace: content quoth <hi>Meg,</hi> look what thou wilt allow,
I will not diſlike, ſo paying the ſhot, away they went.</p>
            <p>At length when the marriage day was come, and that the bride
in the midſt of her friends was ſet down to dinner, <hi>Margaret</hi> and
<hi>Gillian</hi> attired in red petticotes, with white linnen ſléedes, and

ſorrie for their hard fortunes, and blaming the Bridegroom for
his unkindneſſe: Nay do not ſo quoth <hi>Meg,</hi> for you ſhall finde

kept all the year long forty ſad men and Prentices at work,
and every one be cloathed in tawny Coats, which he gave as
his Livery, with black Caps and yellow Feathers: and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Sunday and holy day, when this Gentlemanlike Citizen
want to Church in his black Gown garded with Velvet, it
was his order to have all his men in their Liveries to wait
upon him, with every man his Sword and Buckler, ready at
any time, it need required.</p>
            <p>It came to paſſe upon <hi>St. Georges</hi> day, that this Eolly

ſquaring lads they be, they look as if they would fight with
<hi>Gargantus,</hi> and yet I durſt lay my life they dare ſcant kill a
Hedge-hog: I warrant you there is never a Knight that goes
with ſuch a train: it were good ſport to try what they could
do? My maſtes I tell you this fellow is a hardy Coin, he is

find him not flie a ſoot: With that, comes by luſty <hi>Tom Stute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>

attired in Crimſon Velvet, in watched ſilk, thrump hats, and

and ſo narrowly would they watch them that they could be in
no place at quiet for them, inſomuch that the Captains ſound
fighting work enough and more then they willingly would ſo
that they were ſeldom out of the Surgions hands.</p>

Vpon a time it chanced that being upon a point of their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
to ſea, <hi>Stuteley</hi> and <hi>Strangwidge</hi> having béen at Court,
and newly come from my Lord-Admirals lodging, before they
came to <hi>Chairing Croſſe</hi> they were encountred by two of luſty
<hi>Peachies</hi> men who preſently drew upon them, and laid ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
them, that the two Captains were glad at length to houſe
themſelves for refuge: Now a plague on them quoth <hi>Stute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
we ſhall never be quiet for theſe Queiſtrels? Captain
<hi>Strangwidge</hi> there is no other ſhift but to ſéek their frindſhip,
therefore to kéep our limbs ſound againſt we go to Sea, it is
beſt to uſe a means to quiet this grudge.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid <hi>Strangwidge</hi> it were good to do ſo if a man knew
how: but you may be ſure they will not eaſily be intreated,
ſéeing we have abuſed them in ſpéech: and albeit they ſent
divers of their friends unto Maſter <hi>Peachy,</hi> and by his men,
yet they would not yield, nor give conſent to be appeaſed:
ſo that the Captains were at length conſtrained to make ſute
to the Duke of <hi>Suffolk</hi> to take up the matter, who moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
performed their requeſt, and ſo the grudge ended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them, to the great credit of Maſter <hi>Peachie,</hi> and all
his men.</p>

Now when he heard <hi>Tom Drum</hi> ſo trimly tune it on the way,

at whoſe ſudden ſight <hi>Tom Drum</hi> like one that had ſpied an
Adder, and ſéeing him provided with a good ſword and buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
ſuppoſed he had béen one that waited for a purſe: Good

may'ſt ſée to paſſe beſide me, and that by thy ſpéeding ill, I may
ſpéed the better: what haſt thou ſo much ſtore of money ſaid
<hi>Harry</hi> that thou art loath to loſe it?</p>
            <p>No by my faith ſaid <hi>Tom,</hi> I aſſure thée all my ſtock is but
one poor penny. Why then quoth <hi>Harry</hi> if I were minded to

thy money: but tell me, what is that pack at thy back? ſaid
<hi>Tom</hi> they are St. <hi>Hughs</hi> bones: quoth <hi>Harry</hi> what is that?
a commodity ſaid <hi>Tom</hi> that I cannot miſſe, for they be my

            <p>Quoh <hi>Harry</hi> what occupation art thou of? ſir quoth <hi>Tom,</hi>
I am a Goldſmith that makes rings for womens héels: what

            <p>Happy thou art quoth <hi>Harry</hi> that thou haſt a Trade to live
by, for by that means thou carrieſt credit with thée in every

I am not a aſhamed to tell it, for my name is a Noune ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantive

            <p>I have quoth <hi>Harry</hi> béen unto my Parents untoward, not

I have ſpent all my money, I have utterly undone my ſelf, for

I faith we will be merry at the next Town.</p>
            <p>Alas quoth <hi>Harry</hi> how can that be, ſéeing you have but one

am, thou might'ſt go with a ſingle penny all <hi>England</hi> over,
and at every good Town have meat, drink, and lodging of
the beſt, and yet keep thy penny in ſtore. Believe me quoth
<hi>Harry</hi> that's more then any Tradeſman elſe can do.</p>

Verily qd. <hi>Harry</hi> I would ſpend half of my blood to be of the

<hi>Harry</hi> hang me: then ſaid he annoint me a Gentleman, and

<hi>Harry</hi> took his knife, and cutting his finger, he all to be ſmear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Tom Drums</hi> face with his blood, that he made him look like

            <p>Well Ile take thy word qd. <hi>Tom;</hi> and therefore look that

            <p>

Far enough quoth he, to prove as good a workman as thou

            <p>Now my Maſters tell me, were you not born in <hi>Arcadia?</hi>

who meeting with Henry Nevel, and Tom Drum, went
with him to ſerve Peachy of Fleetſtreet, where for a while
he became a Shoomaker.</head>
            <p>YOu ſhall underſtand that at this time there lived a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
Knight called Sir <hi>John Ransford,</hi> who was for his
courage inferiour to few, and had a brave company of tall
men to wait upon him. He was very charitable to the poor,
relieving them daily: he was a famous Courtier, and in very
great favor with the King; and the only thing that diſgraced
his vertues was this, that he was ſomething wild in his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and wilfull in his attempts; often repenting ſadly
what he committed raſhly.</p>
            <p>It came to paſſe upon a time as he was riding to his houſe,
there was at a certain Village a Corps carried to be buried,
the deceaſed Father of five ſmall Children, and the Husband
of a wofull widdow, whoſe poverty was ſuch, that ſhe had not
money to pay for her buriall; Sir <hi>John</hi> the Pariſh Prieſt
doubting would not do his duty except he might firſt have his
money.</p>
            <p>The widdow with many tears intreated him to do his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
but he would not, ſaying,</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47292:24"/>
What you beggers, would you have me to open my ſacred

            <p>Nay Dame quoth <hi>Jack</hi> do you remember how you ſerv'd me

            <p>At laſt Sir <hi>John</hi> came riding with all his men, of whom
the poor Widdow in this manner began to ask his Arms:
good Sir <hi>John,</hi> if ever womans miſery moved your heart to
pifty, give me one penny for Gods ſake, towards the bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               </gap>ury the dead, or Ile bury him alive: whereupon be
willed one of his men to go and fetch the Prieſt and bring him
immediately, his men did ſo, and forth came the Prieſt in his
Gown and corner Cap, roughly demanding who would ſpeak
with him?</p>
            <p>That would I, quoth Sir <hi>John Rainsford,</hi> and therefore
tell me how it comes to paſſe that you put not this Corps into
the Pit? Sir quoth he, becauſe they will not pay me for my
pains.</p>
            <p>Above all men, ſaid Sir <hi>Iohn.</hi> Prieſts ſhould reſpect the

not bury him ſaid the Knight: no, not without money ſaid
the Prieſt: I pray thee ſaid the Knight let me intreat thée
to bury him: then do you pay me quoth the Prieſt? Sir
<hi>Iohn Rainsford</hi> ſéeing him ſo peremptory, ſwore a great oath,
that if he did not bury the dead Corpe, he would bury him
alive: a fig for you go bury blind Byard when he is dead.
The Knight when he heard theſe words, was marvellous an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
he commanded his men to take him up and put him into
the grave and they took up the Prieſt and wrapped him to his
Gown and put him quick into the grave, and caſt the earth

Knight, no riſing till the general reſurrection: the Knigh ſent
for a nother Prieſt to bury the corps which he did for nothing:
which being done, he gave the poor woman ten ſhillings, and
ſo returned homewards.</p>
            <p>When Sir <hi>Iohn</hi> came home, he told his Lady what he had
done, his Lady being grieved thereat, wiſht he had paid for
twenty burials, then made that one burial: 'tis done now

            <figure/>
            <p>THere lived in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet</hi> at this time a fair widdow, who
was famous for her beauty, as ſhe was eſtéemed for her
wealth; ſhe was beloved of many Gentlemen, and ſued unto
by divers Citizens, but ſo déep was the memory of her late
husband ingraver in her heart, that ſhe utterly refuſed mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Harry Nevell</hi> having his heart fired with the bright beams
of this blazing Comet, ſought all means poſſible to quench
the heat thereof: <hi>Tom Drum</hi> perceiving, demanded the cauſe
of his late conceived grief, ſaying how now <hi>Hall,</hi> what wind
blows ſo bleak on your chéeks now? hath <hi>Cupid</hi> the blind ſlave
given thée a bloody noſe, or a broken head? Oh, no <hi>Tom</hi> ſaid

therefore 'tis not my head but my heart that bleeds. With

whom <hi>Hall,</hi> with whom art thou in love, tell me man? if I
bewray your ſecrets, call me dogs noſe, and ſpit in my face

ſhew their ſecrets to me, then to their Ghoſtly Father: But
art thou ſo in favour with pretty w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nches quoth <hi>Harry?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yes Sir, quoth <hi>Tom,</hi> and I tro I have not liv'd thus long
but I know how to make a woman love me, by a cunning
trick that I have: I durſt lay my life I will make a dozen

            <p>That trick ſurpaſſes all that ever I heard, ſaid <hi>Harry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay quoth <hi>Tom,</hi> Ile tell thee what a merry prank I plaid

Turtle under my left arm, and immediately the wenches
were ſo inamored with my ſight, that they forſook the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers

money in merriment, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and I much wonder you being a young man will not
<pb facs="tcp:47292:26"/>
ſéek a wife that is ſo wealthy, and ſo make thy ſelf famous by
marrying Miſtris <hi>Farmer,</hi> for it is likely ſhe could well away
to make him her husband, to whom ſhe ſo much opens her
hearts ſecrets.</p>
            <p>Tis true quoth <hi>Tom,</hi> and I know that if I ſpoke but half a
word ſhe could never deny me: Nay, ſhe would ſpend ten of
her twelve ſilver Apoſtles on condition I would vouchſafe
to be her husband. But wot you what <hi>Harry,</hi> it is well known
though Lillies be faire in ſhow, they be foule in ſmell, and
women as they are beautiful, ſo they are deceitful: beſides,
Miſtris <hi>Farmer</hi> is too old for me.</p>
            <p>Too old quoth <hi>Harry?</hi> why man, ſhe is not ſo old as <hi>Chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Croſſe:</hi> for in my conſcience I think, that ſince her fair
eyes beheld the bright ſun, ſhe never taſted of the fruits of
twenty flouriſhing Sommers, therefore her age néed be no
hurt to her marriage.</p>
            <p>I will tell thée my mind quoth <hi>Tom,</hi> after that a woman
is paſt ſixtéen or ſeventeen years old, I would not give fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
blew buttons for her. But tell me <hi>Harry,</hi> and that tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
doſt thy like her? and if thou doſt, ſay ſo, and I will war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
her thine own.</p>
            <p>Gentle <hi>Tom Drum</hi> quoth <hi>Harry,</hi> be but as good as thy
word and do but prefer me to her acquaintance, and I will
requeſt no greater a courteſie. Here is my hand quoth <hi>Tom
Drum,</hi> it ſhall be done: The day being ſet down, <hi>Harry</hi> had
prepared himſelf a faier ſuit of apparel againſt the time, and
<hi>Tom Drum</hi> in like ſort had dreſt himſelf in the beſt manner;
ſtill bearing <hi>Harry</hi> in hand, telling him that none ſhould be
more welcomer to her then himſelf. The day being come
<hi>Tom</hi> takes <hi>Harry</hi> by the hand, and coming to the widdows
door, <hi>Tom</hi> falls a ringing of the Bell as if he had been mad,
the Printice came to the door and asked who was there: it is
I ſaid <hi>Tom,</hi> open the door, for I muſt ſpeak with your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtris,
ſtay then and will tell her ſaid the boy, and leaving him
at the door, where he ſate till he was almoſt ſtarved. Quoth
<hi>Harry,</hi> whatſoever your credit is with the Miſtris I know not,
but with the man it is very ſmall. Tuſh quoth <hi>Tom,</hi> I will
once again uſe the help of a Bell-rope.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47292:27"/>
At his ſecond ringing, out comes one of his maids, ſaying,
who the Divel is at the door which kéeps ſuch a ringing?
why 'tis, I you quean ſaid he, who <hi>Tom Drum</hi> quoth ſhe what
would you have? I would ſpeak with your Miſtris ſaid he;
truſt me you cannot ſaid ſhe, for ſhe is at ſupper with two or
thrée that be Sutors: the one is Doctor <hi>Burket,</hi> and Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<hi>Jarvice</hi> the other.</p>
            <p>Tuſh quoth <hi>Tom,</hi> tell me not of Sutors, but tell her that I
am hear and then 'tis well enough: well I will quoth ſhe, ſo
claps to the door again and kéeps them both out of doors. Now
ſaid <hi>Harry,</hi> this gear work but illfaverdly, for you are little
beholding to the maids for ought I ſée: 'tis no matter <hi>Harry</hi>
ſaid he, but if their Miſtris ſhould know this ſhe would ſwinge
their coats ſoundly for it; and with that one of the boyes ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the door, told <hi>Tom</hi> his Miſtris would have him ſend up
his errand, what is ſhe ſo ſtately that ſhe cannot come down?
I knew the time when ſhe would have béen glad to have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with me; I quoth the fellow it may be ſo, when that you
have brought her ſhooes that have pinched her toes. Come
<hi>Harry</hi> ſaid <hi>Tom</hi> I will go up and ſpeak with her: quoth the
fellow but you ſhall not, therefore kéep back and come you
not here.</p>

            <p>Well quoth <hi>Tom,</hi> ſtout on, but Ile lay my life had I not
brought thee with me, no man ſhould have had more welcome

that I ſhould make another co-partners of her preſence: and
I remember an old proverb that love and Lordſhip brooks no

            <p>Vpon a time <hi>Harry Nevel</hi> coming thither, and finding the

how he might caſt out the Doctor and ſo prefer his own ſuite,

            <p>The time at laſt being come that Miſtris <hi>Farmer</hi> had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed

            <head>CHAP. 11. How the Green King went a walking with his wife, and got
Anthony now now to play before them in which ſort
he went with her to Briſtol.</head>
            <figure/>
            <p>THe Gréen King being a man much given to go abroad,
his Wife upon a time thus made her moan to him; huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
quoth ſhe, I think you are the unkindeſt man alive, for
as often as yon walk abroad, you were never the man that did
once take me in your company: it is no ſmall grief unto me,
while I ſit doting at home every ſunday and holy day, and
to ſée how other men walk with their wifes, and lovingly
hear them company into the fields, that thereby they may
have ſome recreation after their weeks weary foyle; this
pleaſure have they for their pains, but I poor ſoul could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
get ſuch a courteſie at your hands: either it muſt needs
be that you love me but little, or elſe you are aſhamed of my
company, and I tell you true you have no reaſon for the one
or the other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:47292:34"/>
Well quoth he my dear, ſéeing you are ſo deſirous to walk
a broad with me, Thurſday next is Saint <hi>Iames's</hi> day againſt
which time prepare your ſelf to go with me to the Fair, where
by the grace of God I will beſtow a fat Pig upon you, and
there I mean to be merry, and doubt not but that I will
walk with you till you are weary of walking. Nay quoth
the I ſhould never be weary of your company though I went
with you to the worlds end: God a mercy for that wife ſaid
he, but ſo doing, I doubt I ſhould try you a very good foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
or a bad flatterer.</p>
            <p>Thus it paſt till Thurſday was come, and in the mean
ſeaſon méeting with two or thrée other Shoomakers, he
asked them if they would walk with him and his wife to
Saint <hi>Iames's</hi> Faire, that we will with all our hearts ſaid
his fellow Shoomakers: but will you not like flinchers go
back from your words quoth the gréen King? To that (they
ſaid) which if they did they would forfeit unto him a gallon
of wine.</p>
            <p>Tuſh ſaid the gréen King, talk not to me of a gallon of wine,
but will you be bound in a bond of twenty pound a peece to
perform it?</p>
            <p>Why quoth the Shoomakers, what néeds bands for ſuch a
matter as this, we hope that you will take our words for a
great deal more then this?</p>
            <p>My Maſters ſaid the gréen King, the world is grown to
that paſs, that word<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> are become wind, and I will truſt you
as little on your word, as long <hi>Meg</hi> on her honeſty, therefore
if you will be bound in a bond ſo, if not, I will make no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of your company.</p>
            <p>The Shoomakers hearing theſe words, and they knowing
him to be a man of a merry mind, after that they had waſhed
their wits well with Wine to the Scriveners they went, and
there they bound themſelves in twenty pound bond according
to his requeſt.</p>
            <p>They had no ſooner made amend of this merry match, but
preſently into another Tavern they get, and who ſhould they
méet but that merry companion <hi>Anthony now now,</hi> who
as ſoon as he ſpied the gréen King, he ſmiled with a wry

               </gap>, but joyfully imbraced him with both his hands, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
what my dear Maſter, well are you met ſaid <hi>Anthony,</hi>
and pray you Sir when came you from the other ſide of the
water, by my troth you are welcome, and I am glad to ſee
you with all my heart.</p>
            <p>God a mercy good <hi>Anthony</hi> ſaid the green King, but how
comes it to paſſe that you go not ſo often into Saint <hi>Martins</hi>
as you were wont to do?</p>
            <p>O Maſter ſaid <hi>Anthony,</hi> you may remember what ſong I
made at your parting when you went to <hi>Graves end.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Yes marry ſaid the gréen King, and what of that? quoth
he, by ſinging that under your window, all the merry Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers
in Saint <hi>Martins</hi> have got it by the end, and now
with their ſo often ſinging it up and down amongſt their jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial
crew, that they have made it as common as a Printed
Ballad, and by their ſo doing I have gotten ſuch a name by
it, that into what place ſoever I go, I am called nothing but
<hi>Anthony now now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now Maſter Ile tell you, that by theſe merry Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers
meanss it hath made me as well acquainted in all
<hi>Cheapſide</hi> and other places about the City as the Cat in the
Cream-pan; for as ſoon as ever the Goldſmiths Wives ſpy
me they will hold up their fingers and cry O yonder goes <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony
now now</hi> that merry companion, and this is thier pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
as I go along.</p>
            <p>And when I come amongſt the Merchants Daughters,
thoſe merry prettey wanton wags will laugh at me whil'ſt
they are ready to beſpiſs themſelves, and call me to them ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come <hi>Anthony now now</hi> play us a fit of muſick ſayes
one; come <hi>Anthony</hi> ſing us a merry ſong ſayes another, ſo
that I cannot paſs up and down the ſtréets by the means of
theſe merry wag-tails, inſomuch that now the little boyes in
the ſtréet will have a fling at my tayle, and take my name in
vain, and ſay O yonder goes <hi>Anthony,</hi> O yonder goes <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony
now now,</hi> and ſo they run up and down after me like a
ſort of Piſmires: good Lord, good Lord, you never knew
the like: hear ye me now my good Maſter? and I will tell
you, that ſince you departed from me and took your journey
<pb facs="tcp:47292:35"/>
beyond Sea, that by ſinging of that ſong ſo often <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">

Wifes window, that I have gotten more pence then your
wife has pins,
<q>
                  <l>So that with taking ſmall pains and little ſweat,</l>
                  <l>My name is as famous as Alexander the great.</l>
               </q>
And now my Maſter ſéeing you are come again and ſafely
arrived from your dangerous voyage from Sea, I will ere
long make the ſecond part.</p>
            <p>But now the gréen King is no ſooner returned from his voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
beyond Sea, but his wife ſolicites him to take a journey
into the Countrey &amp; to take her along with him, for ſince he
had her to Saint <hi>James's</hi> Fair, ſhe was ſo well pleaſed with
him, that ſhe could go with him to the worlds end.</p>
            <p>The Gréen King therefore being willing to give his wife
content, he is reſolved to take her with him to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and
connſidering what company he ſhoud get to go with him to
paſſe away the tedious journey, at laſt he méeting with <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony
now now,</hi> who no ſooner did his Maſter ask him the
queſtion, but preſently he gives his conſent, and immediately
<hi>Anthony</hi> get his Fiddle and away they take their Iourney,
and merrily they march and at every Town they come at
<hi>Anthony</hi> pulls out his Fiddle and playes as he goes, which
the Countrey people much admiring at his mirth and merry
conceits, they were very deſirous to have him ſtay with them,
but <hi>Anthony</hi> not willing to leave his Maſter and Miſtris, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
them to excuſe him; ſo he continued this mirth and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
untill they came to <hi>Briſtol:</hi> where playing up and
down at ſeveral <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> in the Town, he gave the people a
great deal of content, and got as great a name there as he did
in the City of <hi>London,</hi> ſo that he could not paſſe upon down
the ſtréets; they would cry, O yonder goes <hi>Anthony now
now.</hi> And ſo having got the praiſe of the Countrey, he returns
back with the gréen King and his wife unto the City of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
who in a ſhort time after fell dangerouſly ſick, and how
he eſcaped that ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
