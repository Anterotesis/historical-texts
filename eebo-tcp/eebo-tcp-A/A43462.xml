            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE are invited by a Gracious and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull Providence to double the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of this Day, to add incenſe to our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſacrifice, and to wing our devotion and praiſe to Almighty God, with a pious and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96544:3"/>
gratefull reflexion upon a freſh Deliverance; which it may be, nothing but that mighty Redemption could exceed or equal.</p>
            <p>A Deliverance of our Gracious King, and the whole Royal Family; of our Princes and Nobles; of our Church and Religion; of our Government and Laws; of our Lives and Fortunes, and whatever can be thought valuable or dear to Chriſtian men.</p>
            <p>Were an Oratour to manage this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he could not poſſibly want matter to enlarge upon, his hardeſt task would be to know where moſt aptly to pitch, and to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodize thoſe thoughts which would crowd in ſo faſt upon it.</p>
            <p>All the common Topicks from which men uſe to ſhew the becomingneſs and duty of Praiſe, and from which they endeavour to raiſe it to the higheſt pitch, were natural here, and would come in without the leaſt art or force.</p>
            <p>Both the baſeneſs and ingratitude of the Rebellion; the diſmal and deplorable effects that would have followed, had it ſucceeded, and the immediate and even viſible interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Providence in the defeating of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:96544:3"/>I am very ſenſible the enlarging upon theſe were a popular entertainment, and would be gratefull enough in ſome common Audiences.</p>
            <p>But I think you ſomething above theſe things, and know that your own thoughts have anticipated the moſt of what I could ſay upon them, and have therefore deſigned to treat you with ſomething that I take to be more generous and manly.</p>
            <p>To recommend that to you, which (I am ſure) will be the moſt ſubſtantial and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table expreſſion of your praiſe for what is paſt, and the moſt effectual ſecurer of us all from ſuch things for the future; and that is, to comply with the Advice given us in this text, to <hi>ſubmit our ſelves to every Ordinance for the Lord's ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not come to preach up Loyalty in this place, nor am ſo impertinent as to think there is need of doing ſo; but I hope I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to preach up Religion, and recommend the practice of that which is the trueſt ſupport of Loyalty, and every thing elſe that is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God, or of benefit to Man.</p>
            <p>It is for want of this that we ever hear of Rebellion, or are diſturbed with the unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:96544:4"/>
interruptions of it, and it is by a due practice of it, that we ſhall be effectually ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from theſe things for the future.</p>
            <p>'Tis this which is intended to be the ſervice of this day: by this we ſhall beſt anſwer the purpoſe of its inſtitution, and moſt accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly admire and adore that great Providence that hath called us to it; and therefore I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beg that you will hear me with your won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted clemency and candour a few words.</p>
            <p>The Argument that I purpoſe to diſcourſe from theſe words, is to ſtate the true Ground of Chriſtian Loyalty and Subjection, which is ſaid here to be Religion and Conſcience, <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your ſelves to every Ordinance of Man,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>for the Lord's ſake,</hi> that is, out of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate duty to him, and conſcience and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Command.</p>
            <p>Whatever elſe there is obſervable in the Text, will fall in, upon our conſidering this main purport and deſign of it.</p>
            <p>In the proſecution of this Argument, I ſhall endeavour to doe theſe three things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall briefly make good the Ground of the Argument, and ſhew that Religion and Conſcience doth really oblige to this Subjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:96544:4"/>2. I ſhall remark ſome of the advantages of being ſubject upon this reaſon.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Make ſome ſhort deductions from this for our own benefit and improvement.</p>
            <p>Onely if it might not intrench too much upon my time, and your patience, I would crave leave, in order to my argument, to ſtate the Notion of Chriſtian Subjection, as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed here by St. <hi>Peter;</hi> and this the rather, becauſe it would give me a fair occaſion of reflecting upon two things, under which the Men of Republican and turbulent Spirits ſeek to ſhelter themſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then I obſerve, that when our Apoſtle ſpeaks of Subjection here, he intends it equally to the Perſons and Laws of Kings and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and makes no diſtinction at all between them; in theſe words he ſeems to mean their Laws, and in the words immediately follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he expreſſeth their Perſons, <hi>To the King, and to thoſe that are ſent by him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know no reaſon to oppoſe one of theſe againſt the other, or to diſtinguiſh between ſubmitting to them. Subjection to the one, implies Subjection to the other, in the ſober ſenſe of all the World; and every honeſt heart will take it to hold true both ways: He
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96544:5"/>
that ſubmits to the King, will ſubmit to his Laws, and he that ſubmits to his Laws, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſiſt, or offer violence to his Perſon.</p>
            <p>And yet we have had, (and I wiſh onely have had) ſuch nimble Sophiſters, as can put a difference between theſe both ways.</p>
            <p>Some that can talk high of Allegiance, of deference and a mighty reſpect to the King, of being as good Subjects as any, but yet make bold to deſecrate his Laws, and deſpiſe his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, when their Intereſt, or humour is croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as if honour to the one would be ſecured without reſpect to the other.</p>
            <p>And we have others as quick ſighted the other way, that can diſtinguiſh between the Authority and Perſon of the King, and make a pretended reſpect to him in his political Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, an excuſe for Violence againſt him in his Perſonal; that can raiſe Arms by his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt his Perſon, and uſe thoſe Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Man, in defence of the King.</p>
            <p>Sophiſtical miſcreants! as if Authority would fight againſt it ſelf, or Murthering of Kings could be in any ſenſe allegiance to them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Ignatian</hi> Wits never were Authours of a more ſubtile diſtinction, or a neater way of cheating Conſcience than this, and if they did
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:96544:5"/>
not preſcribe to our dull Tramontains in this, it might be expected they would call ſome men ſo no longer.</p>
            <p>I am ſure the Scripture was never ſo nice, as to diſtinguiſh between them, and had <hi>David</hi> known of any ſuch difference, he needed not have been put to any <hi>dilemma,</hi> the caſe had been plain, and the reſolution eaſie, he might have ſlain <hi>Saul,</hi> and yet have preſerv'd the Lord's Anointed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another thing with as much Evil art and ſubtilty collected from hence, is, that Kings and Governours are <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, things of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, yea of the peoples Creation; this is the Palladium of the Republican cauſe, and that in which the rude ſtrength of the Levia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than conſiſts, and no place of Scripture (that I know of) hath been preſs'd to ſerve it like this.</p>
            <p>I confeſs I ſhould not much wonder, to hear downright Atheiſm maintain this, (I know it doth others as abſurd and irrational,) nor to hear thoſe give this account of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Government, that have given a more ſenſeleſs one of the Original of man, if mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Men ſpring up ſo like many Muſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooms out of the Earth at once, then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96544:6"/>
this account might be conſiſtent, and I will never wonder if they that believe the one ſwallow the other alſo.</p>
            <p>But to have God drawn into the Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, and his word ſuborned to ſerve an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, that it is every where ſo expreſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, is intolerably fulſome.</p>
            <p>And yet I wiſh this were the onely inſtance, in which any forced expreſſion, and any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure way of ſpeaking ſhall be made to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front the moſt plain and obvious Doctrines of holy Scripture, when it is the intereſt of ſome Men to have ſuch things believed.</p>
            <p>But theſe things are onely previous to my deſign and argument, to which I now di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly proceed, <hi>i. e.</hi> to lay down the true ground of Chriſtian Loyalty, to fix it upon a principle that will keep it ſteddy in this giddy and wavering Generation; now this is the being ſubject upon reaſons of Religion, upon principles of Conſcience and duty to God, which our Apoſtle means here, by <hi>ſubmitting for the Lord's ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Firſt thing I propoſed on this, was to make good the ground of my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, ſhew that Conſcience doth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately oblige to this, and that if men have a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96544:6"/>
true reſpect to God Almighty, and a regard to the duty that he hath made neceſſary, they muſt thus ſubmit.</p>
            <p>And a very little I hope will ſuffice upon this, in ſuch an Audience, for if the 5th Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the Decalogue be moral, and eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obliging, and if either the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church may be allowed to have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the ſenſe of it: or if the plain Precepts of the New Teſtament may be allowed to be any rule of Conſcience, and God's immediate Commands to lay any obligation upon it, then it is moſt plain that men are as immediately tyed to this in point of Conſcience, as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duty whatſoever.</p>
            <p>So that let Conſcience be as free, as men aſſert it to be, and accountable unto God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as they love popularly to ſpeak, in this we deſire no more to be granted, and are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to joyn iſſue upon it.</p>
            <p>For if Government be God's own imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate inſtitution, and Kings ſpecially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion'd and conſtituted by him, if he have guarded them with Laws, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all to be obedient to them on pain of Damnation, and his higheſt diſpleaſure, then I am ſure if Conſcience be an honeſt reſpect

to God and his Laws, and any thing more than the opinion and fancy of every private Perſon, it muſt neceſſarily oblige all men (that follow the conduct of it) in this inſtance.</p>
            <p>Now whether theſe things be ſo or not, I am content the moſt biaſs'd, and even perjudiced Perſons judge, when they have read ſeven ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the 13th to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and five verſes in this Chapter, where it is plain if either the great Apoſtle of the Circumciſion, or of the Gentiles underſtood the obligation of Conſcience, or may be thought able to direct the obedience of it, we need not contend farther in this matter; though (if need were) we might ſummon the Old Teſtament, the Doctrine and Example of the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> in the New, the conſonant Doctrine and practice too of the ancient and beſt Chriſtians to vouch the truth of all this.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But the thing is plain, and I proceed to repreſent the advantages of fixing Allegiance and Loyalty upon this principle.</p>
            <p>I know too well, how forward ſome men have been to repreſent Religion an Enemy to Government, and to reproach the Doctrine of Conſcience, as a nearer Plea for Rebellion and reſiſtence; and I would to God, that ſome mens practices who have pretended ſo
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:96544:7"/>
much to both, had not given unthinking men too much cauſe for ſuch ſurmiſes.</p>
            <p>But I do not underſtand why this ought to prejudice my preſent argument, unleſs we cannot diſtinguiſh between the truth and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſy of a thing, nor will allow any men to be truly honeſt, becauſe there are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Knaves in the world.</p>
            <p>Allow me that Religion is a real thing, and Conſcience more than a bare Name, (and methinks theſe are no very hard Poſtulates to beg in a Chriſtian audience,) and then I will be content to argue the advantage of it to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, with any thing, that the men of ſenſe and reaſon (as they pleaſe to call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,) ſhall ſet up in competition with it.</p>
            <p>All I purpoſe to ſay, I ſhall reduce to theſe three heads of advantage onely.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt is the keeping men ſteddy, and fixed in their Loyalty and ſubjection.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond is the ſatisfaction and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Princes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third is the ſecuring the divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and Bleſſing, which after all five Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, is the ſureſt Firmament of Kings, and Government too.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:96544:8"/>1. To the purpoſe of keeping men ſteady and conſtant in their Subjection and Loyalty.</p>
            <p>It is a ſad contemplation to conſider, how deſultory and fickle the humours and tempers of men, eſpecially the great crowd of them, generally are: But it is ſomething ſadder to conſider, that there ſhould never be wanting evil and deſigning men to put an evil ferment into their tempers, and to poiſon their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Duty to their Prince. And yet the worſt of all is to conſider, how ready the multitude uſually are for ſuch inſinuations eaſily prejudiced againſt their Governours; pleaſed to hear any ill Stories of them, and apt to Idolize thoſe that ſet up for Aſſertours of their Liberties and Rights, though in the end they find them always the greateſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayers and inſlavers of them.</p>
            <p>Now in this ſtate of things, what can fix this volatile temper of men, and keep them ſteady to their duty, in ſpight of their own inclinations, and the ſorceries of factious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Men, like Religion?</p>
            <p>There are but four things I can think of, to come into the competition in this caſe; Tower in the Prince; Intereſt, Honour or Gratitude in the People. Now, alas! what
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96544:8"/>
can any of theſe do in compariſon of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?</p>
            <p>Power were a ſure way, were it inherent onely in the Perſon of the Prince, and every King like another <hi>Sampſon,</hi> able to deſtroy whole Armies of Rebels by his ſingle ſtrength. But while it is lodged in others, there will be need of ſomething to ſecure it there, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe (as the Great <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſaid once) Kings may be as unſafe amidſt their Armies as without them; and 'twere well if no inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces could be given in which that great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch was a true Prophet.</p>
            <p>As for Intereſt, it is ſo uncertain and change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a thing, that the ſame reaſons that now enduce men to be Loyal, may, if the Scene ſhould change, and a better offer be made, prevail with them to be Rebels and Traytours.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that follow'd our Lord for the Loaves, ſoon forſook him; and thoſe that follow his Vicegerent, for the ſame reaſons, are in danger every hour to do ſo too; things are but at an ill paſs, when Subjects will continue Loyal onely while they are obliged; and when eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little perſon ſhall make head againſt the Court, if he be not advanced and rewarded, as his own ambition and avarice tells him he ought to be.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:96544:9"/>And what is Honour among the greateſt part of men, but a name and a ſhadow? a thing that hangs upon Popular breath, and ſhifts as often as that wind that maintains it. It is a happy thing when it is reputable, and the mode to be Loyal, and when to ſhoulder a man's Prince ſhall be publickly infamous; but he that is Loyal upon this principle onely, owes his Loyalty to that which faſhions his Cloaths, and may poſſibly change the one as eaſily as he doth the other.</p>
            <p>Gratitude and thankfulneſs to a Prince are eternally due from all his Subjects, and a good foundation to build Loyalty upon; and it is certain their returns of duty can never exceed their receipts and obligations: but whoever ſaw a community truly thankfull, or obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a ſenſe of the greateſt favours from their Prince, to continue much longer than their ſhort ſhouts and acclamations?</p>
            <p>We need not look far, or ſearch diſtant Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for evidence of this; we our ſelves have ſeen how little a goodneſs, next to Divine, in two Royal ſucceſſive Inſtancers of it, hath been able to effect upon ſome tempers; and what other uſe an ungratefull generation hath made of it, than to animate their implacable rage
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:96544:9"/>
the more, and to hope for the eaſier ſucceſs of their Rebellions and Treaſons, ſinning the more ſecurely and boldly, becauſe grace did abound, and repudiating all the indulgence &amp; favour of their Prince, as cowardiſe in him, as over-rulings of Providence, or infatuation from the Lord.</p>
            <p>In a word, Loyalty hangs but looſely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men of no Religion and Conſcience; and if they chance to continue good Subjects, their Stars, and not their Principles, are to be thanked for it, as the Moraliſt ſaid of ſome mens conſtitutional vertue, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; ſo we may ſay of ſome mens acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental and chance Loyalty, it owes it ſelf to Fortune and Providence, and the good luck to eſcape trial; and certainly he whoſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue laſts but till a temptation aſſault it, will not laſt very long in this age.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another advantage of fixing Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty upon the principle of Religion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, is the ſatisfaction and ſecurity of Kings themſelves; I do not mean of their perſons, but of their own minds.</p>
            <p>It is certainly very juſt and equal, that Kings who watch and take ſo much care for their People, ſhould have ſome compenſation for that care, at leaſt ſomething to ſweeten and alleviate the burthen of it. As of all men
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:96544:10"/>
living Kings have the hardeſt task incumbent on them, ſo of all Kings thoſe find that task moſt uneaſie, that watch and labour for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull Subjects; make their days toilſome, and their nights reſtleſs, in caring for them, whoſe reſpects they are not ſo ſecure of, but that they may repay all their trouble and care with falſhood and treachery.</p>
            <p>The Royal Breaſt will always have Anxieties enough, occaſion'd by the ambition and ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of Rival Princes; but certainly thoſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are moſt unworthy, that double thoſe Anxieties, by cauſing jealouſies of their own faithfulneſs.</p>
            <p>And for my part, I do not ſee upon what reaſons that Prince can be free from theſe jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, that ſees his Subjects live without any fear of God, or ſenſe of Religion; but inſtead of owning ſoberly the Obligations of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Duty to God, making it too often their buſineſs to ridicule and buffoon them.</p>
            <p>It was a rational way that the Emperour <hi>Conſtantius</hi> once took to make experiment of his great Miniſters, and (in conſequence of that to caſhire all thoſe, that upon his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended invitations renounced Chriſtianity, and returned to Paganiſm; giving this reaſon for ſo doing, That thoſe that were not faithfull
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:96544:10"/>
to their Religion and their God, would hardly be true to their King; and I wiſh it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered whether that Wiſe Emperour ſpake reaſon in this or not.</p>
            <p>What ſecurity can you have of thoſe that dare be treacherous to their God? or why ſhould you think an Oath of Allegiance ſhould hold that man, who contemns the obligation of his Baptiſmal vow? That <hi>Sampſon</hi> that could ſnap aſunder new Cords, would not eaſily be bound with green Withs; and he, whom all that is Sacred, cannot oblige, and upon whom the mighty arguments from eternity can take no hold, why ſhould we think the weaker motives of faſhion or honour can prevail long upon? He that dare impiouſly fly in the face of his God, and prophane every thing that bears his character upon it, why ſhould he revere it onely in his Prince? I will not deny but ſuch a thing is poſſible, but I ask what ſecurity can the Royal Breaſt have that ſo it will be?</p>
            <p>Then onely we give rational aſſurance of our loyalty and faithfulneſs to our King, when we ſhew the ſame to that God, whoſe Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent he is, and whoſe Character he bears; and (to uſe the reverſe to that of our Saviour) then onely ſhall we be truſted, and counted
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96544:11"/>
faithfull in the leſſer, when we are ſeen to be ſo in that which is greater: But if all our vows and mighty obligations to God hold us not faſt, who will think that our Proteſtations and Oaths to Man ſhould be counted inviolable?</p>
            <p n="3">3. And laſtly, I urge Loyalty upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience upon this mighty advantage, <hi>viz.</hi> the endearing of divine Providence, and ſecuring that bleſſing of Heaven, which is the firmeſt ſtabiliment, and the greateſt ſafety both of Prince and People.</p>
            <p>I take it for a certain truth, and an Article of Natural Religion and Belief, that after the utmoſt care and policy of men, ſtabiliment and ſafety is of the Lord; and that unleſs God <hi>watch the City, the Watchman waketh but in vain.</hi> And there have been ſo many ſignal remarks of this given in all Ages of the World, that unleſs Man deny the Faith of all Hiſtory, and can reſolve all the events and iſſues of things (even the moſt miraculous and ſurprizing) into blind chance, they muſt be convinced, that there is a Superiour Power that over-ruleth and ordereth all theſe things, as himſelf pleaſeth; that there is no Power or Wiſedom againſt God; and that after all the counſels and devices in the heart of Man, <hi>the counſel of the Lord, that ſhall ſtand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:96544:11"/>And methinks (of all people in the World) we in this Nation ſhould not be now to learn this, nor be contended with about the belief of it, who have ſeen ſo many viſible interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of Providence in behalf of our King, our Church, and our Nation: thoſe ſtrange and ſudden changes of things, and thoſe migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty deliverances effected, which nothing but the right hand of God could bring to paſs.</p>
            <p>It were well worth conſidering therefore certainly, how we may ſecure the influences and bleſſings of the ſame Providence ſtill; and whether there be any ſo certain a way to this, as acting honeſtly upon Principles of Religion, and Conſcience to God in all the inſtances of our ſubjection and duty to our King; the doing duty <hi>in ſingleneſs of heart, as unto Chriſt; as unto the Lord, and not to men onely,</hi> as the Apoſtle excellently adviſeth Servants.</p>
            <p>For in ſuch a caſe we approve our ſelves to God as his Servants, of whom he will never fail to take care; we render our Duty and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance God's cauſe, and go the beſt way to engage his maintaining of it.</p>
            <p>For God is always ready to bleſs his own Inſtitutions, and will never fail to bleſs thoſe that keep religiouſly cloſe to them; and when we honeſtly revere theſe, we ſhall find he will
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96544:12"/>
bleſs us in our ſubjection, and bleſs him too to whom we are ſubject; for good Subjects may make good and happy Kings; I wiſh good Kings could as eaſily make good and happy Subjects: And certainly, to preſerve that due reſpect and honour to God, by whom Kings Reign, and out of that reſpect to pay a religious fealty and ſubjection to them, is a ſure way to draw down his bleſſing upon both, and entitle both moſt certainly to his protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and care.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And now I beg leave to put a period to this diſcourſe in the laſt thing I propoſed, and all the improvement I intend of it, ſhall be in theſe three ſhort Inferences.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From hence we may inform our ſelves of one great reaſon of the unſteddineſs of men in their Allegiance and Loyalty in this age.</p>
            <p>The ſickleneſs and unconſtancy of <hi>Engliſh</hi> men is grown into a Proverb, and hath too juſtly render'd us vile and cheap in the eſteem of other Nations; but there are few inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in which it more juſtly doth ſo, than our inſtability in our Allegiance to ſuch a King, and ſubjection to ſuch a Government, which all (but our ſelves admire, and envy us for.</p>
            <p>For my part I can reſolve the cauſe of this into nothing ſo rationally, as want of true
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:96544:12"/>
Religion, and due reſpect unto God, unleſs it be a divine infatuation, <hi>and this evil alſo be of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No People talk more of Religion, and yet I fear few practiſe it leſs, we have wrangled and diſputed ſo long about it, till we have quite loſt it; and had God, and Conſcience ſo long in our Mouths, that our hearts have almoſt forgotten that there are any ſuch things; and 'tis not to be much wonder'd at, if ſuch men do not greatly revere God's Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, or if they do, that they are not very zealous and ſteddy in doing ſo.</p>
            <p>I know not how a Houſe ſhould ſtand without a Foundation; nor what great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is between ſtanding upon a floa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Sand, and no Foundation at all; there is no great thing to be expected from him that is Loyal upon uncertain and ſhifting rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; he that chanceth to be Loyal, may chance to be a Traytour; and he that is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject upon changeable reaſons, will upon the change of thoſe reaſons, change his ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into Reſiſtence.</p>
            <p>It is very well, and we ought to adore the good Providence of God for it, that men may be Loyal now upon all theſe lower rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; that our circumſtances are ſo happily
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96544:13"/>
changed, that even our Intereſt combines with our Duty, and is complicated with it; but ſuch duty will ſcarce hold out in the day of temptation, or ſtand, if what ſupports it chance to fail.</p>
            <p>Then are men to be relied on (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,) when their Allegiance is upon Principle, and their Loyalty the effect of true Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; when men honour their King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they love their God, and dare no more become Rebels, than they dare be Atheiſts; when they revere their King as an imbodied kind of Divinity, the Image and Character of the great God; who reſents any diſreſpect or injury we doe our Prince, as done againſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf who will ſtrictly require it, and ſeverely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it; and who counts himſelf blaſphemed, when his great Miniſter is ſo.</p>
            <p>Theſe are arguments that will hold men faſt, and keep them cloſe to their duty; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them againſt all the batteries and charms of Rebellion, and all the inchantments of factious and ſeducing men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From hence we may learn what to think of thoſe men, that plead Religion for Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and Conſcience to God for reſiſtence againſt the King.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:96544:13"/>There are two great degeneracies of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion at this day, juſtly chargeable with this egregious Prevarication, and it is not eaſie to ſay which are more ſo; their Faces (like <hi>Sampſon's</hi> Foxes) look two ways, and they would be taken to be at the greateſt enmity and diſtance; but it is notorious they have united in ſetting the Chriſtian world in a Flame; and I am perſwaded no Places can hope long to enjoy Peace, where they are freely permitted to earth and propagate.</p>
            <p>If any chance long to do ſo, it is in ſpight of them, and their Principles too, which are ſo very dangerous in their nature, ſo directly in their conſequences introductive of diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance and confuſion, that if any Perſons leven'd with them continue good Subjects, it is becauſe their hearts are better than their heads, or the Vipers are under ſome powerfull charm.</p>
            <p>We have been loudly alarm'd in this Nation with the effects of both, and (unleſs we be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated) may with our own experiences forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie our ſelves againſt their Importunities; if our reaſon were not able to ſecure us, yet our experience may, and warn us againſt attending to thoſe men, who may court us as fair, as the <hi>Hiena</hi> doth the Shepherd, but whoſe embraces we have found to be as terrible and deadly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:96544:14"/>There hath been great diſputing about Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and conteſting the marks of a true Church; I think it would be one good way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the conteſt to this queſtion, and put the debate upon this iſſue; and I am very ſure a Church that teacheth Doctrines that any way vacate a ſtanding Law of Religion, and diſpenſe from obedience to it in any caſe, may ſafely be condemned as Antichriſtian, how much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may pretend to infallibility on the one hand, or purity on the other.</p>
            <p>It is a ſad Story, that any that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians ſhould become Rebels and Traitours; but to plead Chriſtianity for being ſo, is a great deal worſe: it is bad enough to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate the Laws of our holy Profeſſion, but to traduce them, and make them a Cloak for our Villanies, and ſuch horrid Villanies too, is a Sin next to that which is impardonable.</p>
            <p>Were this a place fit for a Satyr, or did my Religion permit me to bring a rayling Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt any man; I might be pardon'd, if I did a little warmly inveigh againſt our late Rebels, and indeed the whole race of them for nigh fifty years, for this grand prevarication, the making Conſcience <hi>a cloak for maliciouſneſs,</hi> and ſuborning the Religion of the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> to abet ſuch barbarous Villanies, as have ſcarce
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96544:14"/>
been done by Pagans and Infidels; there are not names bad enough for ſuch Profligates, unleſs they be thoſe of that curſed Apoſtate Spirit, who is always a Devil, but never more ſo than when he aſſumes the form of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And Laſtly, this may be of good effect to indear Religion to our Governours, which is ſo ſerviceable to Government; and engage all us who are Subjects to mix Religion with our Loyalty, and ſhew our ſelves to be good Chriſtians, as well as good Subjects; yea to be the one, that we may be the other; I preſs not the firſt of theſe, and we are all happy that I need not; bleſſed be God we have a Defender of our Faith; a Prince to whom it hath ſo far approved it ſelf, as to ingage his Royal word for its protection; in this all honeſt men rejoice and triumph, and bleſs God for the ſecurity of it; no men ever doubting the ſincerity of it, but thoſe whoſe own guilt and hypocriſie ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them always ſuſpicious, and diffident of all men.</p>
            <p>But I beſeech you give me leave to preſs the ſecond, and effectually prevail with us all to make real Conſcience of Religion, and duty to God; not onely that we better may, but while we do expreſs it to our King; to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:96544:15"/>
good men, as well as good Subjects, and to ſhew that our being the one, is the effect of our being the other.</p>
            <p>I do not in this go about to recommend to you that whining, whimpering, noiſie, ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, formal Religion, that is nothing but the ſhame and hypocriſie of it, and which (I fear) prejudiceth many againſt it, as an ungentile unſociable thing, unfit for Courts, and men of addreſs.</p>
            <p>But I mean that true, ſolid, ſubſtantial Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that conſiſts in a great ſenſe of our God, and a care to approve our ſelves to him in generous and worthy actions; in Juſtice, and honeſty, and great charity; in ſcorning to do an ill thing, or to debaſe our ſelves by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe mean and pitifull vices that Grooms and Porters now rival their Maſters in.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to remember you of two or three things, and I have done.</p>
            <p>I have told you already, that this will be the moſt acceptable expreſſion of the preſent praiſe; and I tell you now, 'tis the onely one. A truly religious heart is the onely Altar from whence God will accept any ſacrifices; and pure hands are onely fit to offer them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> true Piety is the onely thing that clears the air, and cauſeth our incenſe to aſcend and appear before God; but
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:96544:15"/>
Vice raiſeth ſtorms and thick vapours, which hinder its aſcent, and cauſe it to rowl back up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our own head, in pitchy and black ſmoak, the ſad indications that our Perſons, and our Sacrifices are equally odious to him.</p>
            <p>But I would have leave to add ſomething more; you cannot be ignorant what a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter our Enemies endeavour to fix upon us, and under what diſadvantage they repreſent all Loyal Subjects, while they glory in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as the onely godly and ſober part of the Nation.</p>
            <p>I thank God the charge is not ſo juſt, nor the guilt ſo general as they invidiouſly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it; but they that are ſo prodigal of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to themſelves, are always ſparing and nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly to others; and no wonder to ſee thoſe men induſtrious to leſſen other mens reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that have nothing but that to raiſe their own upon.</p>
            <p>But yet certainly a good uſe might be made of this, and in this we might cauſe our falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers to benefit us; by rendring us more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of our lives, and more ſolicitous to cauſe <hi>our light to ſhine before men,</hi> that the World <hi>may ſee our good works,</hi> and ſee alſo how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt thoſe men are that do ſo maliciouſly and falſly accuſe us; and as our Apoſtle adviſeth us
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:96544:16"/>
in the verſe juſt following the text, <hi>By well-doing to put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, I beg you to conſider what a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion you profeſs, and of what a Church you call your ſelves Sons; a Church that inſtructs you truly in your duty to God, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> too; and never knew how to diſpenſe with one, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of the other.</p>
            <p>A Church that teacheth Subjection and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty without any reſerve, and a neceſſity of real holineſs, without hopes of commutation.</p>
            <p>A Church that knows no more how to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve impiety againſt God, upon the reaſon of Loyalty to the King, than to hallow or allow Rebellion againſt the King, for the intereſt of the Church, and advancing the Sceptre of Chriſt, as ſome have loved to Cant.</p>
            <p>A Church, and Religion that indulgeth no manner of vice, that ſets Traytours and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Rebels and Debauchees in the ſame rank, and threatens the ſame ſad portion to both.</p>
            <p>Finally, Let me leave this one great thing with you, that in our caſe of Subjection, both the great arguments in the text combine, and it is hard to ſay, which is the more viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and obvious, to ſubmit for the Lord's ſake, and to doe it for the King's ſake too; to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit for the Lord's ſake, who hath ſo remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:96544:16"/>
appeared for him; and to doe it for the Kings ſake, who ſo worthily deſerves it from us.</p>
            <p>Shall I be allowed to ſay one thing, without offence, or imputation of baſe flattery or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. That if ever King might expect cheerfull Obedience from us for his own ſake, or chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge it for God's ſake, that happy Prince that governs us may do it juſtly; whom Providence hath ſtill attended, and Miracles of it guarded through ſo many Storms, and at laſt landed him ſafe, and ſet him upon a ſteady Throne.</p>
            <p>And who is kind to us to the utmoſt of our wiſhes; in ſuch an inſtance, and to ſuch a meaſure, as paſt ages have ſcarce ſeen, and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ones will ſooner admire, than believe.</p>
            <p>It was <hi>Gamaliel</hi>'s argument in a leſs obvious caſe once: Let us take heed of fighting againſt God; and yet God had ſcarce ſo fully appeared in that caſe, as in ours; he had begun indeed to diſplay his Power, and immediate interpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in behalf of the Apoſtles and their doctrine, and it greatly affected that Wiſe man, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened his care.</p>
            <p>Lord! how plain and viſible is the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in our caſe? and how effectual ought it therefore to be upon this generation? when the greateſt favour and kindneſs upon Earth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites, and when Miracles from Heaven com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand our ſubjection?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:96544:17"/>What ſhall we ſay of thoſe men, whom nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bands of ſuch Love, nor chains of ſuch Miracles can draw to their duty? What can we ſay or think, but that the ſame chains of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in which Devils themſelves are bound, are reſerved for them for ever?</p>
            <p>I conclude with that of the Prophet almoſt in a like caſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.11. <hi>Lord, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not ſee:</hi> (when it ſcatters confuſions and plagues upon Traytours and Rebels; and when it ſhowres down Miracles of bleſſing upon the head of thine Anointed, and his Servants under him) <hi>but they ſhall ſee and be aſhamed,</hi> confounded at their envy, and overwhelmed with their own black deſpair; ſinking under their own guilts, and periſhing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their own remedileſs anguiſh and horrour.</p>
            <div type="benediction">
               <p>While the King ſhall rejoice in thy ſalvation, O Lord! and in the mercy of thee the moſt high God, he ſhall not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry; and while all his true and faithfull Subjects that honour thee in him, and him for thee, ſhall waſh their ſteps in bleſſing, rejoicing in thoſe ſignal deliverances and ſalvations that thou vouchſafeſt us here, and in pious and humble hopes of that Eternal ſalvation hereafter: Which we humbly beg in the Name, and for the Mirits of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt: To whom with thee, O Father, and thine Eternal Spirit, three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and one God, be aſcribed by us, and thy whole Church, all honour, glory and praiſe, now and for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, <hi>Amen.</hi>
