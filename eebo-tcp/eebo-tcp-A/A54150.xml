            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <signed>
                  <hi>By one who deſires to</hi> Give unto Caeſar the things that are Caeſars, and to God the things that are Gods.</signed>
            </opener>
            <p>THat this Nation, and the Nations of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> concerned with it, are at preſent in ſuch a poſture, and under ſuch circumſtances, as give juſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon both of fear and care more then ordinary both to Rulers and People, is ſo without doubt, that it needs no proof; and that we are in a dangerous Feaver<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in regard both to our Civil and Religious Intereſt, all in their wits muſt know: which Diſeaſe, albeit it be now in the opinion of moſt come to a <hi>Criſis,</hi> yet few can determine whether it will end in a natural cool, or prove a diſtemper yet more dangerous and deadly. And truly, at this time we are ſo far happy, that though the Evil be great which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, us, yet the Cauſe thereof is very manifeſt, ſo that we are not put to the diſadvantage of an uncertain ſearch in that matter. We ſee all this trouble proceeds from a pretence of Religion, and Opinion that men have drank in, that for and becauſe of Religion, they ought to concern themſelves in the Civil Government of the Nations, yea ſo far as to overturn it, if otherwiſe the advancement of their Religion cannot be procured. How much this Opinion, albeit managed by men vaſtly differing as to the Religion they would advance, has wrought to the ſhaking of theſe Nations, few can be ignorant; ſo that it ſeems high time, and no ſeaſon more opportune then now, that this Queſtion were fully decided, <hi>What is the Intereſt of Religion in Policy or Civil Government; and again, of Policy and Civil Government in Religion? And how far men upon the account of Religion may and ought to meddle in the Government, or with the Governours; and again, how far the Civil Magiſtrate, as ſuch, ought to concern himſelf in the Conſciences of the People?</hi> that if poſſible, ſuch Principles may be pitched upon, agreeable to the nature of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and to the ſoundeſt Principles of Government, by which men may be poſſeſſed with a Faith, that Chriſtianity doth not oblige them to meddle in Government, and recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally that they may be the more quieted in that belief, that the Magiſtrate is not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern himſelf in their Conſciences: ſo that in this mutual aſſurance, the Magiſtrate may rule ſecurely, and adminiſter Juſtice to all equally, without fearing hurt from the Religion of any of his people; and the people may fear God, and follow piety, according to the beſt of their knowledge, without fearing prejudice from the Magiſtrate therefore. And truly it cannot but be acknowledged, that it would be a happy Nation where this were fully fixed; and the eſtabliſhing of ſuch Principles ſeems the leſs difficult, that in the pureſt times of Chriſtianity, (ſo reputed by all) the true Chriſtian Religion was not at all hurtful nor dangerous to the Magiſtrate, though differing from it; nor did the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians judge it any part of their Religion, to ſeek to diſturb him in his Government, or ſcrew themſelves into it: and though again they acknowledged his Authority in Civils to be juſt and lawful, yet they claimed an exemption from being impoſed upon by him in the exerciſe of their Conſciences; ſo that a re-eſtabliſhing of thoſe Principles and Practices which were believed and followed, by thoſe who on all hands are affirmed to have been the pureſt Chriſtians, and alſo good and faithful Subjects, will do the buſineſs.</p>
            <p>But for the more clear underſtanding of this matter, it will be fit to take it a little higher, and enquire how thoſe two great Intereſts of Religion, and Civil Government, came to be interlaced and mixed together. <hi>Cain</hi> was the firſt that diſturbed Civil Society
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55932:2"/>
becauſe of Religion; and the Scripture, from which alone we may expect it, gives no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of any thing like the mixing of theſe Intereſts before the Floud; and after the Floud, the whole tract of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Hiſtory from <hi>Heber</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> (for of the particular ſtate of the <hi>Jews</hi> I ſhall ſpeak anon) <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> ſhew, that the matter of Religion was wholly diſtinct from the outward Policy and Government then uſed in the World. <hi>Jacob</hi> lived in <hi>Laban</hi>'s Family, though differing from them; and <hi>Joſeph</hi> among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> with which Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Nation we cannot ſuppoſe he joyned in Worſhip, and yet was both a faithful Friend to <hi>Pharoah,</hi> and conſiderable Ruler over the People. Moreover, if the true ground and riſe of Government be conſidered, this will more appear; for all Lawyers and States<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>men derive the firſt grounds of Government, from the Poſterity of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Sons after the Floud, and do ſhow how through neceſſity, Reaſon and the Law of Nature led them thereunto; for the Law of Nature giving to every man a natural and paternal Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over his own Family, when as the increaſe of Mankind, and neceſſity of Commerce, gave occaſion for ſeveral Families to be concerned together, and that theſe concernments begot Controverſies needful to be determined, and that every Family ſtood upon equal foot as to Authority, and to decide by Force would prove deſtructive, and not neceſſarily be juſt, and that it was unfit every man ſhould be Judge in his own cauſe; therefore Reaſon led them to chuſe men of approved Juſtice and Honeſty, to whom all differences were remitted, and whoſe deciſions ſerved as Laws, and were readily ſubmitted to, the parties reſting in the aſſurance of their equity: and this all Lawyers generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was the firſt foundation of Civil Government, in the joynt agreement of ſeveral Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; from whence aroſe the Inſtitution of Cities, and from their Intereſt in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try about the diviſion of Provinces and Kingdoms. Now as in the firſt part of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Families, the Authority ſtood in one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Afterwards when the reſpect put upon theſe Rulers or Kings, and the advantage thence accruing increaſed, men began to be ambitious of the Imployment, and from thence to uſe their influence to obtain it; from which followed Faction, and often Bloudſhed, which made men fall upon the expedient of letting the Government reſt upon the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of thoſe who formerly had poſſeſſed it, the Veneration of their Fathers, and the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and expectation they might inherit their Fathers Virtues greatly contributing thereto; which laid the foundation of Hereditary Monarchy. But when the Primitive ſimplicity and integrity of thoſe firſt Ages began to wear out, and that thoſe Kings did extend and advance the Authority they derived from their Predeceſſors, but loſt their Equity and Juſtice; and ſince the ancient and entire confidence put in the firſt Rulers, had made their Government, and conſequently their Succeſſors, unlimited, it depending upon Will, and not qualified by any Laws, whereof there were not written at that time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus Monarchy degenerated into Tyranny, as appeared in <hi>Nimrod,</hi> and his Succeſſors, the Kings of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> which gave a riſe, as many judge, to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>twixt Religion and Policy, and claim the liberty of the one, without prejudice to the other; for this making Religion neceſſary to Policy, took its ſtrength from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Tyranny of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchy, and was the fruits of an Arbitrary Power, ſtanding and exerciſed in the ſuperlative degree; (and it's obſervable, that where there is moſt of that ſort of Government, there this, to this day, moſt prevails; this being moſt ſuitable to meer Tyranny, and contrary to a ſolid and well-ballanced Government:) for ſuch being the ſtate of the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchy, as all well read therein know, the Flatterers of theſe Kings poſſeſſed them with a belief, that the Authority of no Power even in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, was to be acknowledged, nor even the Counſel of any Deity ſought to, above or beſides that of the King; for they did not build the reaſon of Obedience, upon the intrinſical verity of the thing commanded by the King, as thoſe that preſs the ſame thing now would ſeem to do, or for ſhame pretend to do; but meerly upon the Will and Command of the Prince, whom they think ought not to be diſobeyed, whatever he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, whoſe Will they would have to be the only rule of mens Actions in all things: Hence came the fury of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> againſt the Three Children, for not obeying him, <hi>Dan</hi> 3. in falling down before his Golden Image; and againſt <hi>Daniel,</hi> for praying with the Windows open towards <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; for neither of them are charged for doing any thing prejudicial to the State, and except in this, were found faithful Servants to the King in other things wherein they were imployed. And as none will readily juſtifie the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> King in his doings, whereof himſelf greatly repented, ſo the Imployments he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon thoſe and other <hi>Jews,</hi> and wherein they proved uſeful and faithful to him, doth ſufficiently ſhew, that the diſtinct Intereſts of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Policy</hi> under one Prince, may well be found without prejudice either to Prince or People. The like may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the caſe of <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> who was influenced by <hi>Haman</hi> to give out an Edict for the deſtruction of the <hi>Jews</hi>; the reaſon whereof urged by <hi>Haman</hi> was, that they had Laws different from the Kings Laws, and therefore it was not for the Kings profit to ſuffer them. I need not beſtow pains to refute <hi>Haman</hi>'s reaſon, ſince moſt men will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it.</p>
            <p>The ſame thing took place for the ſame cauſe in <hi>Nero,</hi> and the reſt of the Emperors who perſecuted the Chriſtians; for the piety and ancient equity and ſobriety of the <hi>Romans</hi> wearing out, and the corruption<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> degeneracy and effeminacy of the Eaſtern Nations pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, ſo as the Emperors would be reputed and adored as Gods, thence came their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to oblige men to acknowledge no God but their Will and Pleaſure, and no Religion but what depended thereon; thence they made Religion a neceſſary part of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. And thus I have briefly traced things until ſuch time as Chriſtianity came to be eſtabliſhed by Law, and Chriſtians came to be Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>After that Chriſtianity came to be received in the Courts of Princes, and that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors became Chriſtians, their honeſt zeal was ſoon abuſed by the corruption and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs of the Clergy, who for their own ends firſt poſſeſs'd them with a belief that they ought to ſeek to ſettle and eſtabliſh Chriſtian Religion by their Force and Power, and that it did much contribute to their Spiritual advantage to beſtow large Revenues upon the Clergy, and that as Supreme Magiſtrate he had a care and ſuperintendency over the Church; in meddling with which the Emperor <hi>Conſtantine</hi> found himſelf quickly not a little embaraſſed, when he could not find a way to ſatisfie the Clergy, when they came to quarrel among themſelves; and ſo each Party afterwards in the differences of theſe Times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as they could draw the Emperor to their ſide, made uſe of this Power of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate in matters of Religion, for the deſtroying each other: until at laſt by the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Superſtition and other great ſhakings which hapned to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, the Pope inſtead of being ſubject to the Emperor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and appointed by him (which he was for ſeveral Centuries) made a ſhift to turn him by degrees out of <hi>Italy,</hi> eſtabliſh to himſelf a Temporal Juriſdiction in <hi>Rome,</hi> as being forſooth <hi>Peters Patrimony,</hi> and at laſt not only to be independant from the Emperor, but ſuperiour to him, as by the tract even of their own Hiſtorians is manifeſt, and known to all thoſe who have read the ſtory of <hi>Hildebrand</hi> and others. And thus by the like means ſeveral Biſhops in <hi>Germany,</hi> and other places, abuſing the zeal and ignorance of the people, came into the poſſeſſion of great Temporal Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55932:3"/>
and not only ſo, but in all Nations of <hi>Europe</hi> they obtained a place in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and became a diſtinct State; by means of which, having an immediate depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the Pope, he came to exerciſe an Univerſal Monarchy in the Chriſtian World: And thus Religion came to be a part of Civil Government among Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>And it is greatly to be regretted, that in the Reformation this was not rooted out, but in a great meaſure retained not only by the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> but even by the <hi>Calviniſts</hi>: So that although thoſe who follow the <hi>Geneva</hi> Diſcipline, do pretend to abſtract the Clergy from meddling in State, yet their method of proceeding proves at laſt the ſame; for while they lay an obligation upon the Magiſtrate, under pretence of taking care for the Cauſe and Church of Chriſt, to eſtabliſh one ſort of form of Religion, and ruine all others; wherein he muſt ſteer by the Clergies Compaſs, or otherwiſe have the people blown up unto a Sedition from the Pulpit: So that experience hath proved, that under the Government of Presbytery, (eſpecially as it was improved in <hi>Scotland,</hi> where it came to its height) the inſolency and imperiouſneſs of the Clergy became no leſs troubleſome and unſupportable to the Magiſtrates, then that of Biſhops, whether Papal or Proteſtant; ſo that it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, the altering from one form to another, hath not cured theſe Nations of the miſchiefs that therethrough has attended them, ſo long as that fundamental Error is entertained, of making Religion a part of the Civil Government. Now this brief Hiſtorical hint doth abundantly ſhew, how theſe Intereſts are diſtinct, and ought not be jumbled together: To which I ſhall add theſe brief Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe Religion and Policy, or Chriſtianity and Magiſtracy, are two diſtinct things, have two different ends, and may be fully proſecuted without reſpect one to the other; the one is for the purifying and cleanſing the Soul, and fitting it for a future ſtate; the other is for the maintenance and preſerving of Civil Society, in order to the outward conveniency and accommodation of men in this World. A Magiſtrate is a true and real Magiſtrate, though not a Chriſtian; as well as a man is a true and real Chriſtian, without being a Magiſtrate. Chriſtianity, far leſs this or that form of it, doth not belong to the being of Magiſtracy; elſe the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians could not have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Heathens to have been their lawful Magiſtrates and Superiors, as they did, and taught their Diſciples ſo to do, as appeared in the practice of the Primitive Chriſtians beforementioned.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Chriſt ſays expreſly, <hi>his Kingdom is not of this World</hi>; the thing he came for is a buſineſs diſtinct from the external Government of the World, and hath no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary connexion thereto; and therefore there doth not appear any one ſaying of his or his Followers, to warrant Magiſtrates as ſuch to meddle in Religion, or to warrant his Diſciples and Followers as ſuch to meddle with the outward Government of the Nations: And truly the diſmal effects this has produced, both to the ruine of Chriſtianity and Civil Government, may convince thoſe that are not byaſſed by particular Intereſt, (as all Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, both <hi>Pope, Prelate</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> generally are) and love the good and advancement either of Chriſtianity or Civil Government, that it is high time to avoid this ſnare.</p>
            <p>To this the ſtate of the <hi>Jews</hi> is uſually objected, whoſe Religion and Government was mixed together: But that ſaying of Chriſt abovementioned is thereunto a ſufficient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, for they had an outward Kingdom, which Chriſt came not to eſtabliſh, neither for himſelf nor Followers; and theirs related to a particular Race or Family, which is not the caſe now: beſides that their outward Policy was by Revelation expreſly given them of God, who gave them Rulers, Judges, Kings, oftentimes by the particular appointment of his Prophets, without reſpect either to hereditary Right, or the choice of the People; and unleſs we would plead for the like thing now, which none I know of do, I mean of thoſe that ſtrive for the Government, there can be nothing rationally urged from the ſtate of the <hi>Jews</hi> in this matter.</p>
            <p>But ſome may be apt to ſay, that there is a neceſſity that Religion and Policy be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced, becauſe thoſe things are a part of Religion, which are of abſolute neceſſity to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; ſuch as the ſuppreſſing of <hi>Murther, Adultery, Theft, Perjury,</hi> which ſurely belongs to the Magiſtrates to puniſh. To this I anſwer, It is true it belongs to the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to puniſh ſuch like crimes; but as theſe things are contrary to the Law of God, and ſuch as Religion ſtrikes againſt, ſo they are injurious to Civil Society, and tend to deſtroy it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore come under the Magiſtrates cognizance in this reſpect, or under this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duplication, and not upon the meer Religious account; for whatever is deſtructive or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to Civil Society, comes to be puniſhed by the Magiſtrate upon that ſcore, without reſpect to its concern in Chriſtianity: as we ſee theſe things were puniſhable by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates in all well-regulated Kingdoms and Commonwealths among the Heathens; where
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:55932:3"/>
they could not be conſidered as any part of the Chriſtian Religion. Not that I deny, where both Magiſtrate and People are Chriſtian, and agreed in the acknowledgment that ſuch things are not only hurtful to Civil Society, but deſtructive to their immortal Souls, he may improve that reaſon to deterr the people from theſe evils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as alſo to bear home to them the juſtice of the puniſhment: but this he does not ſimply as a Magiſtrate, but as a Chriſtian, even as ſuch Magiſtrates among the Heathens as were Philoſophers ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſed to do.</p>
            <p>To this I ſuppoſe it may be alſo readily objected; That according to this Principle both Papiſts, Presbyters, Anabaptiſts, yea ſuch as were <hi>John of L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yden</hi> and his Complices, may and ought to be tolerated, if the Magiſtrate has nothing to do with the Conſciences of his Subjects: And again, if the Magiſtrate ſhould become any of theſe, the People ought quietly to bear it. To this I anſwer, and indeed herein the excellency of this fundamental Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple both in Religion and Government will appear, That Popery hath two parts, the one is that which is meerly Religious, that is, which relates properly to Religion or Conſcience, and are peculiar to them, ſuch as the believing Tranſubſtantiation, Purgatory, Adoration of Saints and Images, yea and the Superiority of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> over other Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as they call them; all which, and thoſe of this kind, may be believed and profeſſed without prejudice to Civil Society, and as being matters meerly relating to Conſcience, come not properly under the Magiſtrates cognizance. The other part is the opinion of the Pope's power over Princes and States, his abſolving the people from their Obedience, his giving them Diſpenſations to kill and deſtroy them; and allowing them not to keep Faith to Hereticks, and ſuch like; which as they are deſtructive to Government, are truly no part of Religion, but a politick contrivance long hatched by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> and his Dependants, for eſtabliſhing to himſelf a firm Monarchy in the World, and therefore ought to be guarded againſt and puniſhed by the Magiſtrate, not as Errors in Religion, but as deſtructive to the Government. If it be ſaid, all Papiſts believe and profeſs, and are ready to practiſe theſe things: To that I ſay, then in ſo far they are lyable and ought to be puniſhed, and not tolerated. But let the reaſon of our procedure &amp; ſentence againſt them be, not their opinion in things meerly Religious, but their deſtructiveneſs to Civil Government: Thus if we go upon this ſound Principle, we ſhall preſerve the honour of the truly Chriſtian &amp; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Cauſe, and take away from them all occaſion of glorying in their Sufferings, or of ſtrengthning themſelves againſt Proteſtants in Popiſh Countries, who live peaceably, and hold no ſuch Principles as oblige them to make any diſturbance in the Government. The like may be ſaid of all others called Sectaries, whom the Magiſtrate is to reſtrain only in ſo far as they hold principles, or bring forth practices that are deſtructive to the Government. As to the ſecond part of the objection, relating to the Magiſtrate, I anſwer, ſuch are either Elective, or Hereditary; if Elective, there is no place for the objection, becauſe the Electors have acceſs to chuſe men of ſuch Principles as they like beſt; if Hereditary, it is either abſolute, or limited; if there be any ſuch exyreſs limitation, as excludes men of ſuch and ſuch Principles, then the caſe is ſolved; if not, the former diſtinction will hold: Let the Magiſtrate entertain ſuch Principles as beſt likes him, in matters that are purely Religious; but if he will entertain ſuch as are deſtructive to the Government, by which he infringes the priviledges of the people, and will rob them of their Lives, Liberties and Eſtates, meerly upon the account of Religion, certainly they have great reaſon to beware how they come under ſuch a Yoak; which they can do without any blemiſh, and with full juſtification in the face of the Nations, ſince they deny not the Magiſtrate the exerciſe of his Religion for himſelf: and herein the people alſo may be ſufficiently ſecured, whatever be the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>giſtrates Religion, if thus bounded, as in the application to the ſtate of things here in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> alſo, will appear, to which I now proceed.</p>
            <p>It is to be conſidered, that theſe Nations having been long involved in a Civil War, through which a new people (not formerly, or but little known) have grown up, who as men have or ought to have an intereſt in the ſame Immunities, Freedoms and Priviledges with the reſt; as to Civil things at leaſt; for elſe in <hi>England</hi> the Papiſt might plead <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> that all but they ought to be extruded the Nation, or be lyable to ſuch troubles as might make it too hot for them to ſtay in; and ſo in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> if not by the ſame, yet by other <hi>mediums:</hi> ſo that as to the Spiritual Conſtitution, or the Civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe Nations as to Spiritual things the Laws have not been as thoſe of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> but have received alterations according to the neceſſity and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of times; that thoſe who have given the Law, and in and for whoſe favour, for whoſe protection the Laws were expreſly made, had them turned againſt them, and for the protection of thoſe againſt whom the Laws were made.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:55932:4"/>Since the coming in of the King that now is, (after a long Civil inteſtine War, as hath been ſaid) that which hath been ſet up paramount over and above all, hath been that of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> or <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> to the utter ſuppreſſion of all others; with all ſtrenuous endeavours to ſtrengthen and propagate that Profeſſion, and drive on an Uniformity, which how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual it hath hitherto been, all may ſee, as may appear by the Kings Declaration in the year 1672. and though a conſiderable time hath ſince intervened, it may ſtill be ſeen there was good reaſon for the import of that Declaration, whereby the Ship of theſe Nations hath been toſſed and lyable to great hazards, through the tumultuating humours, ſurmiſes, diſcontents of the ſeverals concerned, in being lyable to be out of the protection of the Law; ſo that upon theſe accounts, and the concurring circumſtances that either have been, or might have bern artificially managed to blow the Coal; I ſay, conſidering the combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtible matter, it is to me matter of acknowledgment and admiration, that things have not run unto confuſion long ere now: And truly my hope is, that God Almighty intends better things for theſe Nations, then that one ſize or ſort of people ſhould be ſet up in matters of Religion, to the utter ruinating and undoing of all others; or that thereby through the impatience of man, (to whom it is hard to bear to have his Spiritual and Civil Liberties ſnapt away at once) or through the artifice of them who upon other grounds of diſcontent, may make uſe of this to blow theſe Nations into a flame, which God forbid, my hope and deſire is rather, that thoſe in Authority may conſider as Chriſtians and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent men, how to land the Ship in a ſafe Harbour. Firſt, how as Chriſtians they are not concerned to meddle in this matter; that is, that Chriſtianity lays no obligation upon the Magiſtrate to eſtabliſh any form of the Chriſtian Religion by Law, is above ſhewn: ſo that ſuch do ſay nothing to the purpoſe, who land this debate (as moſt of the Clergy do) in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring to the Laws in force, ſaying, <hi>So it ſtands by Law, ſo it is ſettled by Law,</hi> for the Law was no leſs ſtrong in <hi>Q. Maries</hi> days for Popery, then now for that which is ſet up. Next, if it ſtand upon a meer prudent prudential politick foot, and ſo be ſettled by the Laws of theſe Nations, I apply my ſelf in the ſecond place to conſider, how far it is truly ſuitable to prudence, how far it is prudential for the Magiſtrates of theſe Nations, how far it is good policy in them to own, aſſert, lay claim to ſuch a power, as things are circumſtantiated eſpecially; that is to ſay, to ſet up by Law any form of Chriſtian Religion, and by the Civil Power and Authority to ſtand by the Profeſſors of it, to the depreſſing, extermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, diſcountenancing, cruſhing and diſcouraging of all others: I ſay, this ſeems to me not only to be Antichriſtian, but Antiprudential, Antipolitical, and a thing of a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dangerous conſequence, and impracticable for any long continuance, without the hazarding of all, for theſe Reaſons.</p>
            <p>It is not prudential for Magiſtrates to keep alive Seeds of diſcord, emulation, ſtrife, among the people over whom they rule, for this but narrows his or their power, inſtead of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging it; for as this engages thoſe who are countenanced, ſo it alienates more or leſs all thoſe who are diſcountenanced or is lyable to do ſo. Beſides all the ſeveral other diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judgments in theſe Nations, there are three ſorts that lay claim to the Magiſtrates eſpouſing them and their way, as that which he is obliged to do in a National way; and all theſe three lay claim for the limits of their Church to be as broad and long at leaſt as the Nation, to wit, the <hi>Popiſh, Prelatical,</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian</hi>; all theſe pretend to be diame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trically oppoſite to each other, and each of them have had the advantage to get the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate on their ſide, and to be ſettled by Law; publick places and publick maintenance have belonged to them: Thus even the Democratical Government of <hi>Presbytery,</hi> could cry out on all meddlers with Church-Lands, but eſpecially Tithes, as Sacrilegious perſons. Now this hath been eſpecially the Bone of Contention among theſe three; it was not, nor is not meerly that any of them ſhould be owned to be the Church and Miniſtry of Chriſt only, or before all others, but that they ſhould be ſet above all others, ſo as to have the maintenance and reſpective priviledges due to Holy Church. Now were it prudential to ſet up any of theſe three, as the preſent condition and complexion of the Nations are? I ſay, Nay; as for the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> they are a diminutive Sect to the reſt of the Nation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively, though upon all other accounts they ſtood upon an equal foot with the reſt differing from them, as I have ſhewn before they do not: as to thoſe of the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> way, ſuch as truly are engaged in their Judgments to that way, are not much more conſiderable then they, ſo that they will be found but a diminutive Sect alſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that to eſtabliſh them, and drive a Conformity to them, hath been hitherto but to go againſt Wind and Tide, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſence of the people (though upon differing accounts) hath been and is againſt them: as to the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> it is to be confeſſed they are more conſiderable then both the other for number, though not of one Judgment among themſelves, albeit all agreeing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55932:4"/>
that they ought to be ſet up, owned and countenanced by the Magiſtrate, and he to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to them, not to be the Head of the Church, that is lodged in the General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly: yet in prudence it is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>t, nor a foot large enough for the Magiſtrate to reſt upon, ſo as to cruſh down all others; for they, taken as all of one Judgment, will be found but a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutive Sect, put in the ballance with all others, to wit, the other two beforementioned, and the reſt of the diſſenters in the Nation. And as they are a people poſitive and peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and lyable to fall in differences among themſelves, as was manifeſt in <hi>Scotland</hi> about the year 1650. it will be no leſs hard to ſatisfie them; then they to ſatisfie one another; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this will be the <hi>minimum quod sic,</hi> that all others muſt be cruſhed and born down, ſo as it will be found hard to pleaſe them, for they will be found to grow in their Encroachments and Demands, and it will not be found ſo eaſie a matter, whatever cauſe or occaſion ſhould be found for it, to limit or ſtop them once being ſet up as they that are leſs conſiderable: neither do I ſee it prudential for the Magiſtrate to countenance any of theſe, ſo as to give them the ſole countenance of Publick Authority, as to Church-Power, as it hath been called and accounted the National Church, &amp; ſo theſe to have Publick Authority and Maintenance, and Priviledge accord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Or is it to be reckoned upon that the Presbyters, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever countenance or toleration were granted them, though ſettled by Law, would be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied while excluded from the Publick Places and Maintenance? and they being the ſtronger, and a growing Intereſt, would ſtill be lying at catch to be in again; were it not then good Chriſtianity in the Magiſtrates, who profeſs themſelves to be Chriſtians, to deny themſelves in giving to Chriſt Jeſus that which is his due only, that is, to be Head in and over his Church, and leave the Government to him, and get their hands out of this Thorny matter, that hath produced nothing to themſelves but trouble, without which theſe Nations can never be firmly ſettled: I am bold to ſay, and were it not good prudence ſo to do. What hath been the <hi>Fama clamoſa</hi> for many years of old, and of late before the War, and ſince the coming in of the King, and is ſo at this day? <hi>Popery! Arbitrary Government!</hi> there hath a Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie entred the minds of people concerning theſe things; could a better way be found out to pluck up theſe ſurmiſes by the Roots, then if all concern'd would ſhew a willingneſs and ready compliance, and contribute to it in their reſpective places and ſtations, that it might be fundamentally ſettled and eſtabliſhed as a Baſis never to be ſhaken, that all Chriſtian men ſhould be left to the Government of the Law of Jeſus, to worſhip him and ſerve him, as they ſhall find themſelves by him obliged; the Magiſtrate not at all to meddle or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddle therein, further then to ſee that this be kept among all, ſo that no man nor men may be impoſed upon in the matters of Religion, within the bounds of his Juriſdiction, by any outward force or violence; nor his Authority be made uſe of to confirm any Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſentence more or leſs, but as every one hath been or may be perſwaded to joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to any ſorts of people, upon a Spiritual or Chriſtian account, they may be left ſo to do in matters meerly and only relating to Conſcience, and that all Laws to the contrary may be utterly and totally aboliſhed; and as to all other things, every one from the leaſt to the greateſt to be ſubject to the Civil Laws of the Nation, and that Order and Good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment among men may be eſtabliſhed, and that none under whatſoever pretence may plead Immunity from ſubjection to the Laws, in ſuch things that come properly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably under the Civil Magiſtrates cognizance; ſo that he may be an encouragment to thoſe that do well, and a terror to evil doers, that good and wholeſom Laws may be made by thoſe to whom it is proper ſo to do, for eſtabliſhing the Rights and Properties of men as men, and for encouraging Sobriety; and this is proper for the Magiſtrate.</p>
            <p>But what will become of Holy Church, will ſome ſay?

But ſaith the Biſhops and Hierarchy, What ſhall become of us? if the Magiſtrate withdraw his hand, where ſhall we have Maintenance? where ſhall we have a place to Preach in? Ye ſhall have no leſs advantage or ground to ſtand in then thoſe that relate to other people, that account themſelves to have Miniſters, and to be Churches; yea this advantage you have above all them, that you have had 18 or 19 years Places and
