         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

is for the ſouldiours to be brought vp and inſtructed therin, and the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie
that wanteth eyther of them: to witt the diſciplined ſouldiour and
the generall of iudgment is not perfecte, nor ſufficient to take any great

            <p>There is nothing more proffytable nor mete to bring a generall to
this perfection then to adde to his experience the reding of hiſtories in
the which he ſhall ſe plainly ſet before his eyes in what order battailes
haue ben foughte, ouerthrowes gyuen, victorie vſed, countres defended
and conqueſtes made, wherfore if the generall with his chiefe officers
wante this perfection they are not greatly to be feared althoughe their
armi be of trained ſouldiours. Furthermore their is nothing more to be
embraced by a worthy generall, then modeſty, and there is nothinge
more peryllous in a Generall then to be ambitious raſhe and wilfull, as

            <p>When Minutius came to his campe, he ſpake to his ſouldiours in

            <p>Hereby it appereth that where thinges ſhall take good effecte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it
muſt nedes be that the ſouldiours be broughte vp in diſcipline and that
the generall be able to iudge of diſcipline, as for example liuie in hys
thirde Boke of his fyrſt decade dothe well declare that it was not onely
an armie of trained ſouldiours: that dyd ouerthrowe the people called
Volſci and Equi, but that alſo the conſules &amp; chiefe officers of the felde
were of great iudgement, whoſe good order dyd not à litle preuaile in
that behalfe. Beſyde this it was not only an armie of trained ſouldiours
that diſcomfyted the Samnites not farre from the Citie Sueſſola, where
they ſlewe an exceding great number of them and toke. 40. thouſande
ſheldes which were of the men that were ſlaine, and alſo. 170. ſtandardz
Cornetts, and Euſeignes as wytneſſeth Liuie in his vii. Booke of his firſt
decade, but that alſo the Iudgement of the Conſul dyd muche preuayle
in that behalfe, who when he ſawe the great number of his enemies, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maunded
his ſouldiours to holde them within his campe, whervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the

them ſelues all the countrey ouer to prouyde them of corne and
other victualles, and lefte theyr campe vngarded in effecte, which when
the conſul vndeſtode he exhorted the ſouldiours to behaue them vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
and immediatly went forth of his campe and aſſayled the campe
of his enemyes, and in the firſt charge he ſlewe the greateſt number of
them as they were in their tentes and lodgings, and then commaunded
to ſet all theyr Cornetts, Enſeignes and ſtandardz, vpon the trenches of
theyr campe which he had taken from them, and then lefte for the
gard of the campe two legions, with commaundement that on payne
of death no man ſhoulde take any thing of the ſpoyle of the campe vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyll

negligent and vnprouided enemyes being diſperſed all ouer the felde
and vtterly deſtitute of order ſo that they fled with great confuſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and
feare, not knowing whyther it were beſt to fle, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this was done the
counſul retorned to the campe with great victorie, and then gaue the
ſpoyle of the campe of the enemyes to his ſouldiours. In lyke ſort was
the perfecte order of L. Scipion counſul: no leſſe helpfull to his armye
when that he defeicted the mitghty army of Antioche kyng of Aſia vp
on the Ryuer Phrigio neare to the Citye Magneſia as wytneſſyth Liui
in his fourth decade and vii. Booke. And in lyke ſorte dyd the indgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t

of Alexa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dre the great helpe his ſouldiours i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the battayle that he fought
with Darius in the which with a ſmale number of trained ſouldiours
he defeicted 6. hundred thouſand Perſians as witneſſeth Blondo in his
x booke de La inſtitution de La choſe publique. In the lyke ſorte was
the iudgment of T. Quintius Flaminius helpful to his trained atmie whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he dyd ouerthrowe Philippe the Macedone prince, beſyde Scotuſa in
Gretia, ſlewe viii. thouſands of his ſouldiours and toke fyue thouſand of
them priſoners as witneſſyth Plutarck in his Boke called the ſeconde
part of his lyues, in the lyfe of the ſame Flaminius.</p>
            <p>Beſyde this it was not onely the continuall exerciſe and diſciplyne
of the ſouldiours of Scanderbeg that gaue vnto the Turckes ſo manye
ouerthrowes as are declared in his Commentaries, althoughe they were
becomme throughe their continuall exerciſe as it were inuincible but
his great iudgement in the arte of the warres was a greate parte of the
cauſe therof, for he knewe when and howe to take the aduantage of
his enemye</p>
            <p>Alſo to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me to oure age in the battayle that Frauncys the fyrſt of

great ſkyll and valiantize was ſhowed on both partes, yet was not the
victorie wonne alone throughe the diſcipline of the ſouldiours but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
throughe the iudgement of the conductours. The lyke may be ſayd
of the battayle that the Countie de Augimen fought at Serizoles wyth
the Marques of Guaſto in the yere of oure Lord. 1544 The lyke of the
battayle of Pauie betwyne the aforeſayd Frenſhe kinge and the Duke

to be true, the hiſtories doe all affyrme that the vnderſtandinge of the

it a trayned armie is but as a man mayned in compariſon of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

thoſe that I haue ſeen, I haue not founde one gyuen by vntrayned ſoul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diours.
Wherfore no armie may be called perfecte that wanteth theſe

the ſouldiour brought vp in diſcipline.</p>
            <p>Vigetius ſayeth in his .28 chapiter of his fyrſte Booke of arte of the

vnder theyr yoke the Perſians euen to the confynes of India, beſydes
theſe Lacedemonies, Athenies Marſians and Samnites, The Datianes,
Medes and Thratianes which were ſo warlike that it was ſayd amonge
them that Mars (whom the hethen call the god of battayle) was borne

            <p>Alſo Vigetius ſaithe in his fyrſt Boke and fyrſt chapter of the arte of

Wherfore I wiſhe al men of honeſt ſpirites to ſeke to vnderſtand the

was ſo much the more perfecte, for ſomuch that neither

he knewe well that they were able to leuye a great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,

the numbre of the Chriſtians far greater then in

then of it ſelfe it was, which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they vnderſtode: they
were ſo amaſed, that they knewe not whither to torne
them, for they were oute of al hope that Amorath wolde
euer ſtand them in any ſtede, for ſo much as he was olde
and had giuen ouer all charge and wholly giuen him to
religion, wherfore he wolde no more deale in warres,
and for that Mahometh was ſo yonge, they thoughte it
not good to commytte ſo weightie a matter in to hys
hands, as the leadyg of an armie againſt ſo puiſſant, &amp;
ſkylfull an enemye as Vaiuoda was, and they feared
that if Calibaſſo ſhoulde leade their armye, he ſhoulde
not haue due obedience, which is a thinge moſte peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in all armyes. Thus, when the councell had deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſondrie opinions, they agred vpon none, but were
in great confuſion, conſuming the time in diſcourſes of
none effect growing to no point at all, at the laſt by the

agreed to call Amorath oute of Aſia, and to enforce him
to come, yf that with good wil: he wold not take in hand
the enterpriſe for the defence of his ſonnes ſtate, beinge
aſſured at that time that the Gianizzeries wolde fighte

whoe aboue all other thinges deſyred to haue gouerned

broughte hym wyth them to Andrinople, where
with great diligence: he aſſembled his ſouldiours and

on the other ſide when Selim retorned to his garniſions
he began to ſupplie his bandes with freſhe ſouldiours,

OF THE WARRES OF THE TVRCKES MADE
againſt George Scanderbeg prince of Epirro and of the victories
obtained by the ſayde George, as well againſt the Emperoures
of Turchie, as other princes, and of his rare force and

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Canderbeg prince of Epirto was ſonne to the lord
Iohn Caſtrioth, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which poſſeſſid y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> part
of Albania, that was called Emathia, and
Tumeneſtia: and the mother of Scander
beg was named Volſaua, ſhe was daugh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter
to the prince of Pollogo, whiche is
a part of Macedonia, and alſo of Burgaria, this Iohn
was a worthy man, and of great Iugement &amp; experience
in the warres, and hauinge warres with Amorathe
Ottomanno prince of the Turckes, and ſeing him to be
wexed very ſtonge in Gretia, and Albania, in ſuch ſorte
as in the ende he was not able to encountre him, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he made peace with him, and for hoſtages deliuered
him his ſonnes, which were Repoſſio, Staniſſa, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantino
and this Scanderbeg whiche was then named
George, but when this tiran Amorathe cauſed him in
his chyldhod to be circumciſed, he gaue him the name of
Scanderbeg, which in our ſpeche is, lord Alerandre, and
after that, the Turcke cauſed him to be inſtructed acor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the rite and cuſtume of the Mahometane ſecte
Amorathe truely ſemed to be exceding glad when Scan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derbeg
(being a childe but of eyghte yeres of age) was
broughte to his preſence, and ſeinge him beautifull and
to haue a maieſtie in his countenance, he iugged in hym
ſelfe that yf he ſhoulde lyue longe, he wolde proue a wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thye
man, wherfore he determyned neuer to ſuffer him
to retorne home againe, but to kepe him in his courte,
to the ende that when he was comme to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſtate of a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he ſhoulde ſerue him, and therfore appointed him wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

and to ſe him broughte vp in lerning, and ciuilitie he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
bothe for his table and apparell euen as yf he had
ben his owne ſonne. After this when Scanderbeg was
ſomethinge growen he delighted to ryde, and to ronne,
<pb facs="tcp:7698:81"/>
and alſo with his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mpaniones to vſe the launce, and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
rabattued ſworde, and he dyd excede them all bothe on

of Amorathe, who had greate felicitie of ſe litle
boyes in ſuche exerciſes, and dyd maruelouſly reioyſe to
ſe ſuche force &amp; towardnes in Scanderbeg who alwaies
remayned victoriouſe. After this whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Turcke made
warres againſt anye prince, he commaunded to bringe
Scanderbeg alwaies with him whytherſoeuer he went
and when ſo euer he ſoughte with his enemys Scander

at his doinges and wolde ſaye amonge them ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
that yf he mought lyue tyll he came to perfecte age
no man ſhoulde be able to continue againſt hem. When
Scanderbeg was come to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> age of .xix. yeres. y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Turcke
made him a Sangiacco, which is as muche to ſaye as a
conductour of ſondrie, bandes, and gaue him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leadinge
of fyue thouſand horſes, and ſome tyme the title of geue<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rall
of an armye which in the Turckiſhe ſpeche is called
Baſſa, ſending him againſt his enemyes, accompanied
with mani other Sangiachi which were appointed to be
directed by him, and to be at his commaundement, and
beinge in that parte of the leſſer Aſia that is called Na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tolia,
and hauing many rencountres with his enemyes
he alwayes made great ſlaughter of them and departed
from them with the victorie, by meanes wherof? he toke
manye townes and Cities of that countre and brought
them vnder the obedience of the Turcks, who from that
tyme forth, wolde alwayes ſaye that Scanderbeg was
his righte arme, his harte, and his eye, and his moſte
aſſured defendour, and augmentour of his dominions,
whervpon all the reſte of the Turckes dyd marueloſlye
loue him, and had him in great eſtimation. After this
Scanderbeg beinge of the age of .xxv. yeres and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

of many noble men,<note place="margin">A Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengethe.</note> there came thither a Tartare

foughte with anye but that he ouercame him, and had
ſtaine manye men in the lyke combattes when Scander

with all the reſte of the noble men, wolde in no wyſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree

yet for all that, he made ſo erneſt requeſte and conty<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nued
it with ſuche Inſtancie, that in the end with great
difficultie he obtained his requeſte, and then made him
redie and went in the preſence of them all with great as
to encountre this Tartarre, who diſdained him
euen as Goliathe dyd Dauid, and ſayd that it greued
him much to fyght with ſo yonge a man, wherfore Scan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derbeg
was excedingely wrothe with him, and ſtrake at
him and ſo behaued him ſelfe in the combatte that in the
ende he obtained y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> victorie &amp; ſlewe the Tartarre. Short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after Amorathe went to Burſia: a Citie of Bithinia
where two ſouldiours of Perſia one named Iaia and y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

with launce, ſworde, and Targe, whervpon as
ſone as the chalenge was made, Scanderbeg made redie
and encou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tred with Iaia and as they were erneſtly figh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tinge,
this cruell Zampſa aſſayled him in treaſon, but
Scanderbeg diſcoraged not at all for that but aſſured
him ſelfe in god, and put on a noble mynde and within
ſhorte tyme he ſlewe them bothe, for the which notable
acto he was muche prayſed of all thoſe that were there
preſent, after this y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Hungarians came to make warres

Sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derbeg was ſent Captaine generall, with a gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ate

him ſelfe ſo diſcretely and circumſpectly that the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians
retorned againe withoute battaile. He alwaies
had that attended vpon him Chriſtianes of his fathers
ſubiectes, who alwayes in ſtructed him in the Chriſtian

feared the vertue and worthynes of Scanderbeg
and therfore retorned and wolde not gyue battayle, he
deſyred Scanderbeg to require ſome great gyfte of him
but Scanderbeg aunſweringe very modeſtly ſayd that

he ſhoulde be alwaies aſſured of his good wyl and frynd

well knewe his determynation to be full of crueltie and
wickednes, declared him ſelfe to be w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Hungarianes at the requeſte of the pope Euge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nio,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:7698:82"/>

he came to a ſecrete place, where he was ſafe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peryll,
and afterwarde when it was nighte, the Turckes chiefe
ſecretarie came vnto him and ſaid. O Scanderbeg what
doeſte thou here, thou whiche neuer was ſeen to flee or

wherfore there was no remedie but patience, and when

            <p>The Secretarie aunſwered with a troubled counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
that he wolde not make ſuche a letter for anye

in this ſorte he was preuented.</p>
            <p>Then Scanderbeg with three hundred Albaneſes, va<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liante
and faithefull men, who had alwaies ſerued him
and were well trayned and experimented in the warres
toke his waye, and rode very ſecretly, and ſpedyly, and
in ſhorte tyme aryued in Albania, where he founde cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

corteſly to ſouppe with him, and after ſondrie pleaſante
diſcourſes, aſked them if that they had herde any thinge
of the cauſe of his comming thyther, who aunſwered
him no, then he declared vnto them that for ſondrie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectes,
the Turcke had ſent him to chaunge the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Croia &amp; to ſupplie that place for a ſeaſon, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
they au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſwered al at once franckly, that they were
aſſured that he was ſent for ſome greatter purpoſe then
that, conſydering, that they were well aſſured that the
Turcke loued him as his brother, and one of them, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
to goe before w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the meſſager that he ſent, to certy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fye
the gouernour of Croia hereof, wherewith Scander<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beg

with ſpede. As ſone as the gouernour vnderſtode the
Tenour of the letter, he made redie to doe, all that was

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:7698:83"/>
dayes he recouered all his fathers countre, and by that
twenty daies were ended, he had poſſeſſyd al that which
the Turcke had woonne in Albania, and cut in peces as
as many Turckes as he found there, in ſorte, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> in an in

            <p>When the Albaneſes were thus delyuered from the

               <p>In the ende Scanderbeg made peace with the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianes,
vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> condition that he ſhoulde reſtore vnto them

               <p>When this agrement was made, Scanderbeg ſpake
to the ambaſſadour of Veniſe in ſorte as foloweth, right
honorable my lorde ambaſſadours, it is the opinion of

vnderſtande that I make leſſe acompte of mine owne co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

great preſentes, in token of the goodwyl that he bare to

               <p>At that ſame tyme Scanderbeg made a great courſe

to haue him obedient, faythefull, and his good frynde, &amp;
for the greater aſſurance he commaunded to put al theſe

               <p>Then Moyſes toke his iorney &amp; paſſed on w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his xv.

as Scanderbeg vnderſtode of this practiſe, he did vnite
his armie to the number of r. thouſande men, on horſe,

Scanderbg folowed with great furie, but he coulde not

               <p>Then when all thinges were in that order that he

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and
of no worthynes. Then Moyſes became almoſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate,
and began to diſcourſe in him ſelfe what he were
beſt to doe, he could finde no meanes wherby he mought
remedie his euell, in ſuche ſorte as he mought with his

that he had in this ſorte purchaſed the name
of a traitour, in the ende beinge moued in conſcience he
called to god for mercy: and then he was fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to put his truſte in God, and in Scanderbeg, who
had dyuerſe and ſondrie tymes pardoned penitent offen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dours.
Then he diſguyſed him ſelfe, and came into Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bania
ſecretly, with a corde aboute his necke, caſting
him ſelfe downe at the feete of Scanderbeg with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blinge,

forthe with put forthe his hande, and toke him vp, and
began to diſcourſe with him, euen as thoughe there had
ben neuer anye offence made againſt him diſcourſing of
the practizes that the Turcke had framed againſt hym.
Then Sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derbeg commaunded to apparell him honora<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bly,
and when they had ſupped he reſtored him to all his

that he had franckly pardoned him.</p>
               <p>After this when Scanderbeg ſawe Moyſes faithfull

               <p>When the Turcke vnderſtode the contynuall vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie

and ſo ran ouer his countre at their pleaſure, e<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen
to the very ſea, but they coulde rayſe no proie great

what ſtrengthe his enemyes dyd lye, and whether he
moughte haue anye occaſyon to aſſayle them vpon the

was in the hoteſt tyme of the ſommer, and in the myd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt

               <p>The nexte daye folowing in the morning, Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg
retorned againe to the enemyes determyninge to
fyghte with them all that day, and the nighte folowing
he deuided his armie into thre ſquadrones,<note place="margin">The order of Scan.</note> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one of them
he wolde leave in perſon, the other he comitted to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ducte
of Moiſes a notable Captaine of his, and the other
he gaue in charge to the countie Gintrizza his moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liante.
Nephewe, and he preſented theſe thre ſquadrones
and aſſayled the enemye in thre ſondrye places at once,
and the battayle continued all that daye and in the ende
the enemyes wered wery, wherfore, that moſt ſubtile
countie Iames determyned to fynde a remedie, for that
moſt eminent peryll wherin he was, and therfore wente
forthe of his ſquadrone, and with a lowde voyce called
ſayinge, moſt noble prince Scanderbeg, maye it pleaſe
the that I maye ſafely, comme to ſpeake with thyne ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellentie
of matters that ſhall in no wyſe diſpleaſe the,
<pb facs="tcp:7698:101"/>
Scanderbeg aunſwered that he ſhoulde goe, and comme
ſafe vpon his faythe, then the countie replyed requiring
him that it moughte pleaſe him, to comme forthe of his
ſquadrone, and he wolde doe the lyke to the ende y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they
mighte talke together from their companies, whervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Scanderbeg withoute anye difficultie went forthe from
his ſquadrone acompanied with a fewe ſouldiours, and
when he came neare where the countie was, he cauſed
his ſouldiours to ſtaie a parte from him, then Iames
ſayde my lorde oure talke wyll require ſome tyme wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
maye it pleaſe your highnes that for this daye the
battayle ceaſe, and that commaundement be ſo gyuen
to bothe the armies, Scanderbeg was well contentyd,
then the countie was very glade and began to talke of
peace, and amitie, bothe to the honor of the kinge Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante
and alſo to the honor of Scanderbeg. And as they
were thus talkinge, Moyſes and Gintrizza, two of hys
Captaines broughte in foure ſquadrones of ſouldiours
which they had taken priſoners,<note place="margin">Squadre of toteme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 20. of men at armes 25.</note> and preſented them to
Scanderbeg. Then the countie began to be affraied &amp;
ſuddenly fayned a Iollitie, and ſayde he doubted not at
all, but truſted wholly in the prome<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of Sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derbeg, who
aunſwered, beholde I gyue them all to you, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dinge
that they were all taken before the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was giuen to the armies, and then he cauſed them
to be ſet at libertie, in the ende. When Scanderbeg had
vnderſtode the opinion of the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie in certaine pointes
he aunſwered that it was nedefull to take good aduiſe,
vpon theſe matters, and to vnderſtande the kynges plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſure
in that behalfe, and to giue aunſwere the nexte day
folowinge, when he had thus ſayde, they toke leue the
one of the other, for that it was very late. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> meane
tyme as Scanderbeg made hym redye to goe towarde
Barletta, a ſouldiour of the counties came to Scander<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>beg,
and ſhowed him that all the parliament that the
countye helde with him, was but very diſceite, onely to
to delyuer his armye which was ſo wery, that of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie
they muſt haue ben ouerthrowen, and alſo for that
he had practized with ſome of his ſouldiours, to ſe yf y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
they coulde betraye Scanderbeg, and take him lyuinge
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:7698:101"/>
and this was the onelye cauſe why he came forth in per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon
oute of his ſquadrone, for yf Scanderbeg had not gy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uen
eare to him but contynued ſtyll the battayle, there
is no doubte but that he had ouerthrowen all the armie
for they were all redie ſo wery, that they were determy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to yelde them ſelues. Then Scanderbeg more furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
then anye Lion, cried oute with a terrible voice ſay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>inge,
O y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> moſte wicked murderer &amp; thou countie Iames
thou traitour Ganio, was it not ſnfficient for the with
crafte and ſubtilitie in this ſorte to auoide the diſtructi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on
of thy flugguyſhe and vnproffitable armie, but that
thou muſte vnder pretence of ſo poyſoned a frindſhippe,
ſeke to betraie me whiche am innocent. Wherfore loke
well to thy ſelfe for to morowe thou ſhalte be recompen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed
for thy well doinges, when he had thus ſayde he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
with his people, and went to Barletta, and when
he had ſupped he commaunded to gyue his horſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uender,
and rewarded the ſouldiour that reueled this
matter, and departed in the night by the mone lighte w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
all his ſouldiours with him towardes the enemye, and
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he came to the place where they encamped y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> night
before, he founde all the armie gone, for Zachuria Grop<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pa,
one of the countes ſouldiours declared vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie
euen as it came to paſſe, wherfore the counte with hys
armye departed with ſpede, and went to enrampe, to a
place that was farre of. Then Sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derbeg retorned, and
the nexte morninge he toke the kinge in companie with
him, and myngled their ſouldiours, to auoyde ſtrife, and
then went on folowinge the tracte of the enemie, and in
ſhorte tyme they diſcouered them, &amp; he cauſed to marche
on the one ſyde Frederick Duke of Vrbine lieutenante
of the popes armie, and Alexandre Sforza lieutenante &amp;
brother, to the Duke of Milane, who deſyred erneſtly y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
they mought ſo paſſe ouer, then whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they had al things
in order, they marched on to a Citie called Troia. The
Duke Iohn with the countie Iames and all his armye
were in a Citie called Nucera from Troia viii. myles, a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cordinge
to the meſure of Apulia, betwene whiche two
Cities their was a mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine called Segiano, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Troia

<pb facs="tcp:7698:102"/>
therfore, knowinge that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> armies muſt fighte, betwene
thoſe two Cities, roſe vp in the nighte, and w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diours
went and toke that hill, and furniſhed it w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> men
ſufficient to defende it, to the ende that yf peraduenture
the kings power ſhoulde be ouerthrowen, they mought
take that hill and defend them ſelues, the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie Iames
who in dede was ſkylfull, and of greate experience in
warres, ment alſo to take the ſame hyll, and therfore he
departed alſo in the morninge betyme to take the hill, &amp;
when he founde that Scanderbeg had alredye taken it
where with he was very ſorie, and ſayde to certaine of
his moſt truſtie frinds: that he was then oute of al hope
of victorie, notwithſtandinge he lefte not of for that, but
dyd in euery reſpecte the office and duetie of a good Cap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine,
exhortinge and encoraginge his ſouldiours, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge
them alſo in order acordinge to the tyme, &amp; place.
The nexte morning they determyned to gyue battayle
and made them redie on bothe ſydes, enbattayled their
people,<note place="margin">The bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betwene the Duke Iohn and Scan.</note> and encountred, the fyghte was betwene them
moſt terrible, and contynued tyll the euening in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ende
the Dukes armie was ſo ouerthrowen, and ſpoiled, that
he was glad that he moughte retorne into Fraunce w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
ſhame, and diſhonor, and with the loſſe in maner of all
his Frenſhe bandes, in lykewyſe the countie Iames, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
all the infortunate noble men of Apuglia, fled thorowe
moſt difficulte paſſages euery man his waye, and it was
the greate grace of god y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they eſcaped with their lyues.
Then the kynge was deliuered from his enemies with
great glorie, and triumphe, throughe the worthynes of
the magnanime, puiſſante, and victoriouſe prince Scan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derbeg.
After this the aforeſayde king Ferrante, rode w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
Scanderbeg to ſee yf that he coulde recouer his Cities,
and townes, which he had loſte, he entred into Naples
in great triumphe, and afterwarde wente on their ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
notwithſtanding, manye Cities, and townes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in their former purpoſe, and wolde in no wiſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
the king Ferrante, but ſayde that they wolde rather
dye with their weapones in their handes, then to yelde
them into his wycked handes, for they were wel aſſured
that he wolde be reuenged on them, and wolde obſerue
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:7698:102"/>
no promiſe with them, but they were contented to yelde
them to Scanderbeg vpon his faithefull promes, in the
ende when the kyng, and Scanderbeg had talked togy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it was agreed that the kyng ſhoulde ſwere to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
all promes that ſhoulde be made in his name, and
that Scanderbeg ſhoulde promes his ſubiectes and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
them therof: otherwyſe they wolde not yelde but
wolde fyghte it oute to the vttermoſt, for it ſemed vnto
him a thinge moſt vnſemely for a Chriſtian prince, to
breake his faythe, which is the ſeale of his ſaluation, &amp;
euery Chriſtian is bounde to obſerue it, euen to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes.
Then the kyng ſwore openly that he wolde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
in euery reſpecte what ſo euer hys good father
Scan.<note place="margin">The othe of kinge Ferrante.</note> ſhoulde promiſe, when this was done, Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg
wente and aſſured them all that the kyng ſhoulde
performe his promes in euery reſpecte, and ſhoulde vſe
them all as his very fryndes, and louinge ſubiectes by
meanes wherof al places wherſoeuer he came yelded vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
him, but as ſone as Scanderbeg entred into any place
he cauſed to ſet vp the enſeignes of the kinge Ferrante
and made them ſwere fidelitie, and obedience to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king.
In this meane tyme Fuſano a Sicillian, a man of great
prowes, a rebell, and a mortall enemye to the kynge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſayde
was then in the Citie of Trani, in the forte
therof, and with the ſouldiours that he had, he made co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tynuall
warres againſt the kyng Ferrante &amp; dyd great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
annoie him, wherfore Scanderbeg beinge muche mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
therwith, rote to Trani and toke it and Fuſano al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
who for that he wolde be ſet at libertie and mought
haue meanes to eſcape, commaunded his Nephewe to
yelde the forte into the handes of Scanderbeg. When
this was done, Scanderbeg ſet Fuſano at libertie and
ſuffred him to ronne his waye. When Scanderbeg had
recouered againe all the kynges Cities, townes, and
fortes, which were wonte to obey him, he went ſtraight
to the kynge and reſtored him to them al, praying with
great inſtancie, and modeſtie his highnes, to performe
and kepe all his promiſes which he had made to his ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>iectes:
which thinge the kynge promiſed, and fulfylled
for the great good wyll that he bare vnto Scanderbeg.
<pb facs="tcp:7698:103"/>
Then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kyng cauſed to make ſoleme triumphes. Iuſtes
torneies, and huntings, with other ſumptuouſe ſhowes.
After this he gaue to all Scanderbegs Captaines, and
chiefe ſouldiours, great preſentes and giftes, &amp; to Scan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derbeg
he gaue certaine faire Caſtells in Apuglia, and
then after great thanckes, &amp; corteſe offres of both partes
Scanderbeg retorned into Albania ſafely, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Alba<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>neſes
vnderſtode of the comminge of their lorde, with ſo
great triumphe and victorie, the chiefe of them went to

wolde ſome tyme drincke to him, &amp; cauſe him to drincke
oute of his owne cuppe.</p>
               <p>After this Scanderbeg went to his confynes to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
his Captaine that he had lefte there? Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he went
into Apuglia, and there he made great banckettes to
his Captaine and all his ſouldiours and gaue to diuerſe
of his fryndes, and thiefe ſouldiours great gyftes, to
ſome he gaue apparell of clothe of golde, to others ſylke

to others money, to ſome one thinge, and to others an
other, acordinge to euery mannes deſeruinges, ſo that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:7698:103"/>
euery man was very well pleaſed, beſyde this he neuer
denyed almes, to anye pore man that aſked him for Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtes

chiefely to the ſonnes of thoſe noble men that had byn
chaſed oute of their countres by the Turckes, and to dy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uerſe
noble ſtraungers that came to him from farre, to
whom he gaue not onely money and apparell, but alſo
poſſeſſiones to maintaine them honeſtly, to lyue lyke

that Sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derbeg was retorned ſafely with ſuch
triumphe, and honor it greuyd him muche as it is well
knowen, for Mahomethe dyd neuer vnderſtande that
Scanderbeg had ben in Apuglia in perſon, but thought
that he had ſent onely that Captaine Coico with. 500.

vnderſtode that Scanderbeg had gone in perſon, he had
(notwithſtandinge the trewſe) emploied all his force to

               <p>When the trewſe was ended the Turcke gaue com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maundeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t

in this meane tyme he went with his armie againſt the

               <p>After this he went againſt the Emperour of Trebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonda,

               <p>After this the Turcke ſent an other Captaine of his

ſory, and chiefely for that he was ſo diſcouered: more then
for the deathe of his ſouldiours.</p>
               <p>Then this ſubtill olde Ruter ſent to Scanderbeg a
meſſager, requiring him to fyght with him like a prince
in appointed battayle, and not vpon ſuddennes in ſuche

               <p>When Scanderbeg contrarie to his expectation vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtode

Thre houres before the breake of day, Scanderbeg rode
with xii. thouſande horſe men and fote men, and came

               <p>When he had thus ſayde he called vnto him Peiche

After this he ſuffered the priſoners to departe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <p>When the Turcke vnderſtode this he diſpatched an

it was declared to Scanderbeg by the ſecret arie of Bala<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ban,
which was taken by Scanderbegs ſouldiours in a

were keping of Cattell, notwithſtandinge, hys happe
was to ſerue men of acompte, and ſo became a valiante
man, and for that he was the fyrſt that entred into Con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtantinople,
when the Turckes gaue the aſſaulte vnto
it, the great Turcke exalted him to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> degree. When he
was in this ſorte appointed againſt Scanderbeg, he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myd
outewardely to be muche his frynde, althoughe in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wardly
he was the greateſt enemye that he had in all y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

Scanderbeg with his ſouldiours was in the valley cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:7698:111"/>
Valcal, he made him redie with xv. thouſ<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d horſeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Balaban wyll comme to ſeeke vs with all his power,

goe to that litle hill that is behinde vs, to the ende that
they maye thincke that we flee from them, conſydering
oure number is ſmalle in the reſpecte of them, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
maie the more boldly and aſſuredly chaſe vs, and
then, when I ſhal gyue you a token, euery man to make
hedde, and to charge them beinge ſo ſcatered, by meanes
wherof, we maye eaſyly ouerthrowe them, whiche yf it

they moughte charge vs behinde, and they whome we

               <p>The ſeconde daye after that Scanderbeg had thus

Scanderbeg, and he fled for a certaine ſpace, and then
in an inſtante torned and charged them (he beinge in

very good order) with ſuche force that after longe, and
terrible fyghte, he enforced them to torne their backs, &amp;
to flee in great diſorder, in ſuche ſorte that in the ende y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

Then the ſquadrone of the enemyes (acording to the
ſaying of Scanderbeg) that there was layde, charged
wholly vpon theſe eighte Captaines, which after longe
and cruell fyght in the defence of them ſelues wyth the
great ſlaughter of thoſe amaſed Turckes, paſſed of force

were taken by theſe fotemen, and delyuered to Balaban
who forthewith ſent them to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> great Turcke, who then
was at Conſtantinople. When Scanderbeg vnderſtode
this piteouſe caſe, he ſent immediatly and ambaſſadour

made his courſes into the Turcks countre, &amp; brought

In this companie were certaine Albaneſes hys

Then the Turckes thincking that he had ben ded, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

in the ende they were all foure ſlayne. In this meane
tyme Scanderbeg beinge moued with pitie torned hym

As ſone as Iagup ſawe this, he ranged his armie in thre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſquadrones,

After this Scanderbeg cauſed to gather togyther al the

               <p>When the greate Turcke vnderſtode the dolorouſe

hauing intelligence hereof, made prouiſion for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> defence
of his countre, and eſpecially furniſhed Croia with men
and all kynde of neceſſaries, his ſouldiours on fote were
of the garniſons of the Senate of Veniſe, their gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

thoſe daies there was in that part of Albania which was
ſubiecte to the Seigniorie of Veniſe, their Proueditour
a Venetian borne, named Ioſaphat Barbaro, a man of
great worthynes, who by commaundement of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
dyd often tymes attende vpon Scanderbeg, and
the Arche Byſhope Paulo, who for the great zeale that

contynually with Scanderbeg, onles that he were ſent
in his name or in the name of the Seigniorie of Veniſe
in ambaſſade to anye Potentate for the preſeruation of
there countres, as ofte times he went to Rome, Milane
Naples, Venis, and other places.</p>
               <p>In this meane tyme there came from Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to Scanderbeg two Turckes, ſaying that they were
comme thyther to becomme Chriſtianes, and to ſerue
him faithefully, and alſo to ſaue their ſoules, being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
that the faithe in Ieſus Chriſt, was the onely true

to be falſe, vniuſte, and dampnable, as was eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
ſeen, by the great thinges that god dyd dayely
worcke by one onely man, which in comparaiſon of the
Turcke was a very lambe, and yet dyd contynually tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe

receaued them courteſly and gaue them large pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uiſion
for their maintenance, cauſing them to be inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted
in the Chriſtian religion, euen as they had ben of his

was to a deueliſhe ende, which by y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> goodnes of god was
diſcouered, who neuer faileth ſuch as vnfaynedly truſte
in him, for on a tyme theſe two Turckes fell at wordes

preſented them to Scanderbeg, who cauſed them imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
to be tormented and then they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed the whole
matter in euery pointe, and ſhewed the dagguers which
they caried ſecretly aboute them for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> purpoſe, declaring
<pb facs="tcp:7698:116"/>
alſo howe that y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Turcke had promiſed them an infinite

&amp; ſo apparelled as they were, cauſed them to be han<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged
vpon the heighte of two greate trees, where they
moughte be well diſcerned from all partes of the feeldes

when he had ſpoyled all the countre, he then rayſed fire

and retorned home ſafe wyth all hys people in to hys
countrey.</p>
               <p>After this the aforenamed Mahomethe, came into
Albania with two hundred thouſande men on horſe and
fote, and encamped before the Citie of Croia, promiſing
them of the towne great gyftes, yf that they wolde ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwere
was, with the faire Ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uonade, harquebuzade, and
ſuche lyke, in ſorte, that they ſlewe many of the Turc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
and contynued the ſame daily, vntyll the Turckes
diſlodged from thence and abandoned the ſeege. Whiles
the Turcks laie before Croia, Sca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derbeg was alwaies
attendante vpon their campe, nowe in one quarter, and
then in an other, deſtreſſing their foragers, &amp; alſo their
victuallers comming to their campe, and often times in
the nighte aſſayled their campe, nowe in one quarter, &amp;
then in an other ſo, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he made great ſlaughter of them.
Then at the laſte the Turcke ſeinge Croia to be in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pungnable,
and hauing receaued there bothe great loſſe
of his people, and alſo great diſhonor, he determyned to
leue before it a campe volant, and ſo in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ende by famine
to take it, whervpon he lefte the aforeſayde Balaban to
execute that enterpriſe with xviii.M. choſen horſemen

done, the great Tiran departed from thence, retorning
towarde Conſtantinople, and in his iorney be toke cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

brake his faithe, and cauſed them all to be cut in peces,
which was greatly to the hindrance of Scanderbeg, not
withſtanding, within ſhorte time he recouered al againe
and cut in peces as many Turcks as he founde in thoſe
places, which the Turcke had thus taken from him, the
Turcke retorned to Conſtantinople very ſorowfully &amp;
Melancholyque for the great ſpoyle, and loſſe of his ſoul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diours,
which he had ſuſtained in that iorney.</p>
               <p>Scanderbeg, conſydering the Turckes that beſegid
Croia were valiante and of great experience, and had ſo
fortyfied them ſelues that it was an impoſſybilitie to aſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſaulte
them, for that they had alredie taken y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> hil Crniuo
by meanes wherof, it was expedient to haue a great ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mie
to take in hand that enterpriſe to rayſe them from
that place, Scanderbeg hauing loſte the aforeſayd eight
thouſand men in Chidua, was enforced to demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de aide
of other Chriſtian princes, whervpon he went to Rome
in perſon and declared his cauſe before the pope Pio the
ſeconde and his Cardinales and other prelates in their
Conciſtorie and was gently herde and great promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
were made vnto him, notwithſtanding (at his depar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture)
by meanes of euyll tonges, he receaued ſmale ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
at the popes hande who was a Venetian borne, but
not ouer full of deuotion, and for that that Scanderbeg
was greatly eſtemed of ſondrie of them, it is no maruell
yf others dyd enuie him, by meanes wherof he obtained
no more for his trauayle then. 3000. Ducates onely, the
which Iunetrio beinge one of the chiefe Citizens of Dri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uaſto,
coſyn to the Arche Byſhope Paulo Angelo, and

Steward to Scanderbeg receaued, Scanderbeg was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedingly
troubled with this, notwithſtandinge he gaue
thanckes to God and retorned ſafely into his countrey.
Then he went firſt to Scutari where he founde Ioſafat
Barbaro aforeſayde, lieutenante to the Venetianes,
who leuied bandes of thoſe that were ſubiectes to the
Seigneours of Veniſe and ioyned them with his ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ours,
and prouided them of al kynde of neceſſaries, there
went with him alſo to ayde him, Leche Ducagino, with
his brother Nicholas, with foure hundred horſemen and
as many fotemen, choſen ſouldiours and of great expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
in warres, with an hundred men at armes alſo
well armed and mounted, he had alſo fyue hundred fote<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men

of the countres aboute Scutari, Driuaſto, Antiuaro, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſia,
and Dirachio, which made an armie of .13. thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
and .4. hundred choſen men, with whom Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg
marched toward Croia, and when he came neare y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

my Citie, were as manye moe in number as they are,
we ſhall vndoutedly ouerthrowe them and put them to

               <p>When he had thus ſayde, he deuided his armie into
two partes,<note place="margin">Vaiuoda lyeu: enant to a prince in felde or towne.</note> committing the one to Nicolo Moneta Vai<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uoda

certaine woodes to a certaine ſtronge place called Gio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenemi,
not far from that place where the Turckes laie
in campe before Croia: he commaunded the aforeſayde
Nicolo not to departe from thence in anie wyſe vntyll
that he herde him ſhote of certaine Cannones, which he
dyd acording to his promes. In this meane tyme Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbeg
went with the reſte of his armye and vpon the

of the enemies, and determyned to councell with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſayde
Nicolo, of what ſorte to procede, Balaban ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
intelligence of the comming of Scanderbeg, went
forthwith to Croia, requiringe them to yelde the towne
vpon Conditiones, making them of the towne greate
promeſſes in the behalfe of his Maiſter, perſwading him
ſelfe, that hy theſe meanes he ſhoulde obtaine victorie,
acording to the intelligence that was gyuen him, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon
he had exhorted his armie to be of good chere, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring
to them that yf they moughte haue the towne
delyuered vnto them, that then he wolde with his armie
lodge in the towne, and wolde not care for the comming
of Scanderbeg yf that he ſhoulde happen to comme, but
yf that it ſo chanſed y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> they dyd not obtaine it, he wolde
leuye his campe and departe thence, whyles Balaban
loked for aunſwere there ſorted forthe of the towne cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

beinge exceding wrothe, and oute of al hope of recouerie
of the towne, with his ſouldiours that were then with

them ſelues ſpedylye in to the feelde named Tiranna.</p>
               <p>Then Scanderbeg fynding no man to reſyſte hym
went downe into Croia, and cauſed to bringe into the
towne all the meale, barly, and other victuales that were
lefte in the Turckes campe, whiche were ſufficient to
ſuſtaine them of the Towne for one whole yere, when
he had this done, he lodged in the Citie and ſent certaine
bandes to take the paſſages and ſtraites, thorowe the
which the Turckes muſt paſſe, for he determyned to
ſeke them and to gyue them battayle. That ſame very
euening came two Turckes of acompte to Scanderbeg
<pb facs="tcp:7698:118"/>
deſyring him, in the name of their whole armie to gyue
them their lyues, and that they wolde with one conſent
gyue him willingly all that they had and excuſed them
ſaying, that they were enforced to comme to that ſeege
by the commaundement of their prince, whoſe breade
they dyd eate, ſo that with great humiletie they deſyred
Scanderbeg to graunt them that, which he neuer denied
to their fathers, when Scanderbeg had herde y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> requeſte
of the Turckes, he commaunded them with a fryndly
contenaunce to be well lodged in a faire pauillion, and
to be honorably entertayned. After this, the aforeſayde
Scanderbeg called to him the aforeſayde lieutenante w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
the noble lordes Ducagini, and other lieutenantes, me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of great vertue, vnto whom he declared the requeſt of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
Turckyſhh armie, requiring their aduiſe and aunſwere
Ioſaphat Barbaro (which the Venetianes had ſent into
Albania to be contynually in company with Scander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beg)
ſpake fyrſte and ſayde that he wolde doe nothinge
but what ſhoulde pleaſe Scanderbeg to commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de him
wherfore he wolde doe as it ſhoulde ſeme good to Scan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derbeg
in this matter. After this ſpake Leche Ducagino
very franckly ſaying, Embetha, which in oure tonge ſig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nifieth,
vpon them, for that he thoughte it not requiſite
to vſe mercy towardes infydels, but to cut them in peces
of the ſame opinion were dyuerſe other noble men, and
Captaines of great value. Then Scanderbrg ſpake vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them ſaying, you noble men, and you worthye Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines,
I truſte in the lorde, and am well aſſured, that
yf we ſhall happen to encountie the Turckes, we ſhall
ſone defeicte them. Notwithſtanding, for that they are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
choyſe of all the Turckyſhe armie, and nowe becomme
deſperate, and determined in dede to emploie their hands
and for that alſo that the ende of warres is doubtefull,
and that god for oure offences ſhoulde permitte them to
haue the victorie, as it maye well comme to paſſe. It
ſhoulde be the ruyne of vs all.<note place="margin">Ripe iudg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment.</note> Wherfore to plaie ſuer
it ſemeth to me reaſonable that we reſpecte the attempte
vntyll ſuche tyme as Croia be ſupplied with victualles
and other neceſſaries for manye yeres: and then to goe
on to encountre them with aſſurance of mynde, and to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:7698:118"/>
ouerthrowe them for ſo muche as they can eſcape in no
wyſe for that the paſſages are alredie taken. The opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Scanderbeg was wel lyked of many, and of others
not lyked at all, and chiefely of ſuche as were ſubiectes
to the Venetianes, who deſyred erneſtly to be reuenged
of the Turckes, and of ſome others which had not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented
the force of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Turckes very often. Then Scan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derbeg
called for the two Turckes aforeſayde, and wyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
them to declare vnto the whole armie, that as they
came not with his licenſe to beſege his Citie, no more
ſhulde they departe oute of his countre with his licenſe.
In this meane tyme be ſent his armie to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Ryuer Iſimi
where he had a great number of ſhippes loded w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> corne
meale, biſkete and other victuales, and cauſed all to be
vnloded with ſpede, ſo that in thre dayes he furniſhed
Croia for ſyre yeres. And then went with all ſpede to en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>countre
the Turcks, but he had taryed a longe, for they
in theſe thre dayes ſeinge them ſelues ſo aſſayled wyth
famyne, went to the paſſages, and paſſed of force, not w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
oute greate ſlaughter and ſpoyle of their me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and in this
ſorte fled. Then euery man in maner was ſory, and mur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mored
againſt Scanderbeg, and layd the whole faute of
their eſcape vpon him, but he with his great corteſye, &amp;
gentle wordes pacifyed and contentyd them all, lainge
for his excuſe the olde prouerbe, that to the enemy that
fleeth a man muſt make a brydge of golde, and then gaue
to euery man preſents and gyftes, acording to his place.
In this meane tyme many Albaneſes of the Venetians

to Scanderbeg a great number of the heddes of

yf they wolde delyuer him the Citie, he wolde aduaunce
them, and deale liberally with them all, and otherwyſe
it ſhoulde be to their paine, for he was determyned not

Scanderbeg, on the other ſyde dyd often

the Turcke ſawe that he coulde by no meanes obtaine

marched to a place called capodelli Rodane, neare vnto
the Admatique ſea where Scanderbeg had buylded a Ci<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tie
named Chinril, which was not fully fynyſhed nor
repleniſhed with inhabitanes, he toke it and raiſed it to
the very foundation, after this he paſſed thorowe the
countre of Scanderbeg, thincking to take it from him
but he coulde not take the ſympleſt forte that he had, he
went alſo into certaine mountaines of Albania, where
there were multitudes of Albaneſes, with their whole
familes and ſubſtances, and aſſayled them, but he was
repulſed with great diſhonor, ſpoile, and ſlaughter of his
people: but Scanderbeg who was euer vigillante, and
folowed the Turckyſhe armie daye and nighte, making
great ſpoyle of them, in ſuch ſorte that Mahomethe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>When the Turcke was comme to Conſtantinople
be apointed Alibeg and Aleſbeg his Captaines to haue

no wyſe they ſhoulde goe to fyght with Scanderbeg, nor
to enter his countrey vnles that he firſte began, but one<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
to garde well his confynes. Theſe Captaines came
to the frontiers and obeyd the commaundement of their
lorde, and ſecretly ſoughte to haue fryndſhippe w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Scan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derbeg,
and ſent vnto him preſentes of greate price and
value, he alſo vſed them very corteſly and fryndly, not in
that that he feared them, but bycauſe he wolde not be
counted ingrate: for he neuer truſted them, but ſtode al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye
vpon his garde. In the ende Scanderbeg vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
certaynely, that theſe Captaines had expreſſed
commaundement from their lorde not to make anye at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempte
againſt him, but onely to garde his confynes, &amp;
alſo howe that they were deſyrous to be in peace with
him, he lefte the one parte of his ſouldiours vpon hys
confynes, and toke the reſt with him and went to viſyte
his countre, and to adminiſter Iuſtice and reaſon to ſuch
as had nede therof, and to ſe that none were oppreſſed.
After this, Scanderbeg came to Aleſſio aboute certaine
affares that touched bothe his ſtate, and the ſtate of the
Senate of Veniſe, and chiefely for order howe to take a
certaine newe Citie called Valma, whiche the Turcke
had builded and there fel ſicke of a feruant feuer, in ſuch

ſeing his deathe at hand, he called vnto him all his Cap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taines,

               <p>Scanderbeg had ſcarcely gyuen ful order for his teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament,

paſſed a very ſharpe and difficulte mountaine named
Illugi, which dyd appertaine to the Venetianes, &amp; was

Scanderbeg, beinge greatly moued with theſe newes
cauſed to make him redie, and appointe his ſouldiours

commaunding them to doe whatſoeuer the lieutenante
ſhoulde commaunde them, and that he wolde the nexte

               <p>When the Turcke vnderſtode the newes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> death

to his viſiri and chiefe Captaynes, that it was a fyneſſe

where with all deligence they ſoughte for the bodye of
Scanderbeg, &amp; as ſone as they had founde it, althoughe
in his lyfe tyme they feared it, and alſo hated his name,
