         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Kings laſt Declaration of <hi>Iuly</hi> the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth was publiſhed as an Act of great grace to the Subiect: and being iſſued im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after his Maieſties good ſucceſſe, obtained againſt the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Waller,</hi> and Colonell <hi>Fines,</hi> it emble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized the King (as ſome Courtiers fanſied) with a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Palme in one hand, and a peacefull Olive in the other. Nevertheleſſe, it appeares by the cloſe of that Declaration, that the intent of it was, to bring in Men, Money, Plate, Horſes and Armes, as well as to proclaime pardon, for it
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54658:3"/>
proclaimed pardon to no other perſons, than ſuch as ſhould forthwith apply themſelves to the King, nor on no other Conditions than upon the bringing in of ſuch like Ayds, and ſupplies. The favour was not to bee extended to all, nor was it cloathed in the habit of a Compoſition, or peaceable Accommodation, it onely ſet to ſale a pardon, and the price of that pardon was beſides treacherous combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Papiſts againſt the Parliament, ſuch Money, ſuch Plate, ſuch Horſes, &amp;c. 'Tis true the rate of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe was left indefinite; but it is well enough knowne that all ſuch as have ſubmitted to the King, and confeſſed a guilt of Treaſon in themſelves, and undertaken to redeem the ſame by new ſervices have found their penances rigorous, and their Ghoſtly Fathers very hard to be ſatisfied. The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect therefore which that Declaration had, was no other, as wee can perceive, but to put more courage into the lovers of Parliaments, and to quicken all good men the more in the raiſing of new Forces, and imbarking in harder Adventures: And Gods Name be praiſed, who did not onely then give us ſuch pious and manly reſolutions, but hath alſo ſpeeded &amp; mercifully proſpered our undertakings. The face of things is now changed: The Earle of <hi>Eſſex</hi> hath ſince that removed the Kings terrible Army from before <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and after a bloudy day fought by <hi>Newbury,</hi> is returned home victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Sir <hi>William Waller,</hi> and the Earle of <hi>Mancheſter</hi> are great in new hopes, and preparations, and the Marqueſſe of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> is as fearefull to receive annoyance from the <hi>Scots,</hi> as hopefull to doe any to the Lord <hi>Fairefax:</hi> wherefore it ſeemes to me, that if a faire way of Accommodation were now tendred by the Parliament, it would bee held as honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, as ſeaſonable: and it ſeems not impoſſible to propoſe ſuch termes of Pacification as may well ſtand with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, the ſafety of Religion, the advantage of the King, the juſtice of the Parliament, and the wiſhes of the people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:54658:3"/>The King hath divers times (though not with any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Ceremony or Solemnity) applyed himſelfe to ſatisfie his Subjects by proteſting innocence, and appealing to the judgement of Almighty God; but there hath been ſuch generality in his expreſſions, and defect in his formes hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto, that his Subjects remaine yet unſatisfied.</p>
            <p>That which I ſhall therefore now undertake, with my utmoſt diſcretion and abilitie, is to demonſtrate wherein the Kings Oathes have beene hitherto ſhort, and of little ſecurance, and how they may yet bee complea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and made ſatisfying: I will in the firſt place ſet forth the forme of the Oath, both as it is conceived in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties owne Words, and as it is altered with my addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſuplements; and then I will next addreſſe my ſelfe by way of Reaſon, to give ſome Account why it may bee admitted and entertained by either ſide.</p>
            <p>In the Kings laſt Declaration of <hi>Iuly</hi> aforeſaid, I find the forme of the Kings Vowes, and Proteſtations to run in theſe very words.</p>

I having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with Iustice and Bounty to repaire my Subjects former Preſſures, made excellent Lawes for the preventing of the like, and offered further to adde any thing elſe for the esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the Religion, Lawes and Liberty of the Kingdome. And whereas in September, 1642. in the head of my Armie, (not then great) beſides at other times I made voluntarily a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation to defend and maintaine the true Proteſtant Religion, the just priviledges, and freedom of Parliaments, and to govern by the

            <p>Theſe two conditionall Clauſes I humbly preſent, as neceſſary either to explaine what the King had ſworne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or to diſcover what the King intended before: for if this Oath (as it is now framed) bee accepted, it will let us know how farre we were ſecured formerly: and if it be rejected, it will be an advertiſement to us, what little ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity we are to expect hereafter.</p>
            <p>The ſolemne and ſanctimonious manner of taking this Oath, will next much conduce to the ſatisfying of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for paper Oathes, as they are mingled with other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Declarations are not ſo authenticall with the <hi>Phle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beians,</hi> and we ſhould ſeeme leſſe Religious than our Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors were, in times of more blindneſſe, if wee ſhould not obſerve a great deale of holy ſtate in a buſineſſe of this tranſcendant, and more than ſecular nature. The laſt cautionarie advertiſement that I ſhall humbly tender with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, is, that an Oath may be alſo adminiſtred to the Queen, and to all ſuſpected Papiſts, Aliens, &amp;c. to the reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them from all intermedling in matters of our Church, or State, and from attempting any thing mediately, or immediately, directly, or indirectly againſt the peace of this Kingdome.</p>

Let mee have a little Favour to ſay ſomething herein.</p>
            <p>Oathes have beene ever honourable, and Sacramentall Obligations, ſuch as GOD himſelfe hath not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> diſdained to uſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the taking away of doubt and diſtruſt in man, and ſuch as hee hath preſcribed to men for the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of differences ſometimes, aſwell betwixt publike as private perſons. But in this Conteſtation betwixt the KING and PARLIAMENT, though both ſides have ſundrie times had recourſe to Oathes and Invocations of GODS Name, and more eſpecially the KING, yet that Pacification and amicable Accommodation, which might have beene hoped therefrom, hath not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and conſummated. And I conceive there are two Reaſons why the KINGS Proteſtations have not been ſo effectuall, and available, as was intended they ſhould.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe there is great uncertainty, and diſpute in that which the KINGS Oathes principally take for their ſubject or matter.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe the KING ſeemes totally miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the end of his Oathes, or rather in thoſe Feares and Iealouſies of Ours, which his Oathes endeavour to remove.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the KING by his Imprications would aſſure us that hee intends no ill to Religion, Law, or Liberty, as they are eſtabliſhed in ENGLAND; but our maine ſtrife and controverſie here is how Religion, Law, and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54658:6"/>
are eſtablished in ſuch and ſuch poynts, and who ſhall judge of that eſtabliſhment: wherefore to decide that Controverſie and attone this ſtrife, no generall Oath of the KING can bee held ſufficient. In pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſuits betwixt Subject and Subject, the Law per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits nor the KING to judge, much leſſe does it ſtand to the KINGS judgement, when the ſute is betwixt a Subject and the KING himſelfe; and leaſt of all does it reſt upon the KINGS determination, when the KING is a Partie of one ſide, and the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome on the other. Nevertheleſſe, in this our preſent grand debate, the KING ſweares in generall to doe ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and yet what that Juſtice is, which is to bee done, hee himſelfe is ignorant; nay the greateſt of our profeſt Lawyers adventure not to determine, (they have great Diviſions, and Conteſttions amongſt themſelves about it) although all unanimouſly affirme, that the KING <hi>quatenus</hi> a partie, and <hi>quatenus</hi> a Lay-man, is of all men moſt incompetent for the determination there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. When the Kingdome groaned heretofore under the oppreſſion of the Shipſcot, and divers other Taxes ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly inconſiſtent with the Subjects Libertie, the KING intended no violation of the Subjects Libertie. He had ſworne, or might have ſworne then in generall termes the ſame thing, with the ſame ſafetie as he ſweares now. So if the like diſpute ariſe hereafter, of the like dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie, about ſome other branch of Prerogative (for Prerogative is not made now more knowne, but more unknowne of late) there is no hindrance but the King may treat us as he did then indeeds, yet proteſt as hee does now in words.</p>
            <p>The like may bee ſaid of Religion, the KING intends no alteration of Religion, and expects that wee ſhould <hi>acquieſce</hi> in that profeſſion of his, and yet wee
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54658:6"/>
feare he judges of alteration therein by his Biſhops, who ayme at nothing more than Innovations, wherefore this can be no ground of confidence in us, becauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the KING in his owne underſtanding, may both make and keep ſuch an Oath, yet Poperie ſhall ſtill prevaile, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtaniſme decline, as it hath done hitherto. 'Tis far then from being a ſecurity, 'tis rather a danger to a ſtate to depend on a Princes generall Oaths, when theſe Oathes depend upon his meere underſtanding, foraſmuch as Law does not direct us to the Kings breaſt, as our ſole and ſupreame Tribunall, but rather dehorts us from the ſame, as moſt of all to be diſtruſted: This is a <hi>Dilemma</hi> not to be excepted againſt: either the KING relyes upon his owne Knowledge and Judgement, concerning altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Law, &amp;c. when hee abjures them; or not: if hee does undertake to know, and judge of all alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and of all differences raiſed thereupon in Church, and State, betwixt himſelfe and his Subjects, then is our Government meerely Arbitrarie; more Arbitrarie than the <hi>French;</hi> then are his Edicts and Acts of State our beſt arreſts, and Acts of Parliement; then does our Law, and Religion, import no more to us, than his meere pleaſure. Let it but bee maintained, that wee muſt expect ſatisfaction, and deciſion from the KINGS breaſt, where Poperie and Proteſtaniſme, where Prerogative and Libertie confine, and border one upon the other; and let the maine Secrets and Quaeries of Law bee ſubjected to the KINGS Cognizance, and and for my part, I ſhall ever conceive, that enacted Law, and publike Right, are nothing elſe but Royall pleaſure, and one ſingle mans fanſie, or humour; but on the other ſide, if the KING doe preſuppoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe an incompetent Judge, and as lyable to groſſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>akes, and dangerous deviations in Law, and Religion,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54658:7"/>
as hee hath beene formerly, when wee were almoſt at an utter loſſe in both; if hee will acknowledge that there may bee as intricate controverſies, and as undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable debates betwixt him and his Subjects hereafter, as have beene formerly, and as now are at this inſtant, then all that wee can hope for from his Oathes, is but this, that wee ſhall bee as much diſtracted hereafter, and as remedileſſely torne and divided with diſſentions, as wee were formerly, or are now: all our aſſurance is, wee ſhall bee permitted to remaine and continue in the condition as we were, and as wee (which makes his Oaths of no effect) now are.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the next Reaſon why the KING renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing by Oath all alterations in Law and Religion, does not put us out of all our feares, is, becauſe hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſweares for himſelfe, not his Favourites and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors; and yet our feares have more reſpect to his Favourites than<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to himſelfe. And ſo notwithſtanding the ſecurity which his Oathes gives againſt any ill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, or Machichinations from himſelfe, wee ſtill remaine expoſed to ruine, by the ill intentions, and machinations of ſuch as have a great ſway in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaile, and affections, he himſelfe perhaps being neither privie nor confenting thereunto.</p>
            <p>The KING favours not the Iriſh Rebellion, yet ſuch as were the Favourers, nay the Plotters, and Act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors in it find favour, and receive power from the King: and what difference is it to us, whether wee periſh by the KINGS hand immediately, or by his Favourites mediately; by the Kings owne accord directly, or by his onely permiſſion indirectly? <hi>Ireland</hi> hath ſeene more than two hundred thouſand Families of Brittiſh Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants diſpeopled and maſſacred by treacherous Papiſts,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54658:7"/>
(notwithſtanning that all this Deluge of Bloud might have beene prevented by the KINGS timely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight and care) and ENGLAND is now falling into the ſame deſolation by the ſame faction, and yet the KING is ſo farre from withdrawing favour or power from Papiſts and their accomplices, that hee puts more Armes into their hands here, and holds further corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with them abroad: how can wee then but ſeeme as ſtocks, or more ſtupid than beaſts, if we now expect no aſſurance but an Oath, and include none in that Oath but the KING?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eli</hi> was a good man, but an ill Majeſtrate, hee knew better how to moderate his owne affections, than to bridle the inſolencies of ſuch as were ſubordinate to him; inſomuch, that that good which hee did by himſelfe was farre out-poized by that evill which hee permitted in others, and his lenity to his Children became crueltie to the people.</p>
            <p>Some men are much miſtaken, if there bee not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of <hi>Eli</hi> in our KINGS diſpoſition, for though hee bee eſteemed inflexible by ſuch as hee hath once jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged adverſe to his ends, yet hee is much too ductile by thoſe who have once gotten prepoſſeſſion in his good thoughts. Wherefore if his Majeſtie ſeriouſly deſires to put us into a Condition of ſecuritie, (which is the onely remedy of our preſent diſtempers) hee muſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther provide for our indemnitie by proteſting againſt connivence at evill in his Subſtitutes, than doing evill in his own perſon. For he himſelfe may be as guiltleſſe privately as <hi>Eli</hi> was, and yet in publke wee his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may live as miſerably under his Popiſh Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, as the Children of Iſrael did under <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Law ſayes the KING can doe no wrong, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54658:8"/>
out of its Civilitie it imputes all miſcatriages in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to inferiour agents: but policy teaches us, that though a Prince in Law bee not queſtionable for it, yet in nature hee is ſtrangely blameable, and deeply chargeable, when bee makes an ill choyce of inferiour A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents.</p>
            <p>In Law, it was the blame of <hi>Rehoboam's</hi> young Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, that ſo unpolitick, and unworthy a diſguſt was given to the great and honourable State of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> and it was great pitty that they did not ſuffer for it: But it was <hi>Rehoboams</hi> blame in policie, that hee would chuſe young Conncellors, and hee himſelfe was the greateſt loſer by it. The wiſedome of SOLOMON would direct him to make uſe of that Wiſedome which is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to bee found but in hoarie heads, but the more fooliſh <hi>Rehoboam</hi> is, the more ſolicitous hee will bee to finde out vaine Conſorts, fit onely to comply with his owne folly. Had there been any particular good which <hi>Rehoboam</hi> might have attained too by the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of his Subjects: the old Councellors in probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie would have adviſed him to it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they ſeemed to take more care of the KING than of the people, (as they had done in their old Maſters dayes, to the danger of the nex Succeſſor) But ſuch is the temeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of theſe green headed Statiſts, that they neyther ayme at the good of the people, nor of the KING: They ſeemed to imagine, that it was a ſufficient recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of a thing to a Prince, to repreſent it as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantagious to the People, and in this they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> failed not to pleaſe their raſh Lord, who was ſo farre from gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſatisfaction to the People, as that hee thought it profitable to him to purchaſe their diſpleaſure, though with the imminent hazard of his owne Crowne; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it does not ſeeme ſo probable, that <hi>Rehoboham</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:54658:8"/>
did take prepoſterous courſes, becauſe hee hapned upon prepoſterous Counſellors, as that hee did chuſe prepoſterous Councellors, becauſe he did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectedly addict himſelfe to prepoſterous Courſes. And when the main fault was in his will, rather then his underſtanding, 'twas eaſie for him to erre in the moſt fundamentall point of all politicks, and to place his own peculiar good, rather in the publike diſprofit, then in the benefit of his Subjects. <hi>Machiavell</hi> had never paſt for a wiſe man, had not all his ſubtill grounds tended to the purſuing of that advantage of KINGS, which conſiſts in the peoples diſadvantage; and yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more contrary to wiſdome, or more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Principles of ſolid Policie, then this very doctrine; and without doubt, no wiſe man will ſeek to excuſe him of ſottiſh folly, but by accuſing him of pernitious flattery; for if he did not wilfully betray PRINCES, as perhaps <hi>Rehoboams</hi> Councellors did, ſurely he did but publiſh to the world, the ſickly concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his own narrow heart. The vaſt buſineſſe of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, eſpecially where the Nation is great, or where many Nations are united, is not to be tranſ-acted by any one man: where one man commands in chiefe, the moſt ſublime office of Government is attributed to him, but the greateſt burthen, and moſt important charge muſt reſt upon the ſhoulders of thouſands, as well in Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in Democraſies, or elſe great obſtructions will follow.</p>
            <p>When the Jews were but few in number, and mean of condition in the Wilderneſſe, <hi>Moſes</hi> found the rule of them inſupportable without many aſſiſtants, he was driven to follow <hi>Iethroes</hi> Counſell, as well to preſerve himſelfe from being cruſh'd under too great a weight,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54658:9"/>
as to open the courſe of Iuſtice to the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That part of Government, which is moſt extenſive, and laborious, which requires not onely moſt activity, but moſt skill in many ſeverall Arts, and Sciences muſt be undergone, and managed by multitudes of Agents, and in Monarchies, theſe Agents are more ſubject to one mans will, in Democracies leſſe; but that part of Government which is Supream, and may be concentred in one man, is more facile and narrow, and many times 'tis beſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, when that one man leaves moſt to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes, and aſſumes leaſt to himſelf. <hi>Henry</hi> the third ruled better in his minority, when the higheſt Acts of his royall ſuperintending power were exerciſed by his ſervants, then in his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> maturity, when hee would arbitrarily ſtraine his ſuperintending power, to the over-ruling of his good Councellors, and preferring of bad. The greateſt honour of PRINCES<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is to be wiſe, and the greateſt Wiſedome of PRINCES is, to chuſe fit inſtruments, and this choice cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out publike advice, yet weake PRINCES reliſh no Honour in any thing, but in enjoying their own wills, and their wills they conceive then to be moſt gloriouſly fulfilled, when they pleaſe themſelves by diſpleaſing their Subjects, when in their elections of Counſellors and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites, the State has no ſhare at all, but is rather croſſed, and oppoſed. Was <hi>Gaveſton</hi> ſo deere to <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Second, becauſe he was a good Patriot? No, if he had been ſuch, it had been a vulgar thing in <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> to uphold him, the power of a great PRINCE is more eminent in chuſing inſtruments for his own wicked pleaſure, and then to uphold them, when whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſeeke to teare them from their Maſters bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:54658:9"/>t'is not ſo Kingly to be regulated by wiſdome of Parliaments, as to doe acts of meere will; nor to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre with the publicke ſuffrages of a State, in the promoting of good men, as to reject the prayers, &amp; teares and cryes of Communities in the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of incendiaries, nor to aime at the ſafetie, and proſperity of the people, as to compaſſe private de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes utterly oppoſite thereunto. That Royalty which propoſes to it ſelf the flouriſhing condition of the Subject as it's beſt eſtabliſhment: has more regard to the deputation of worthy Officers in State, then to any other perticular intereſt: but ſince flatterers have found out an other Royalty which propoſes to it ſelf common ſervility for the trueſt baſis of it's grand our; He which can invent any thing for the Subject below woodden ſhooes, and canvas breeches is a rare Polititian, to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued equally with a Princes life, honour and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity. Why was the price of <hi>Strafford</hi> of greater eſteeme then the peace of three Kingdoms? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was a Miniſter better affected to this new Royalty then the ſeverall States of the three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Nations: becauſe he was devoted not only to ſerve the King more then the Kingdome, but even againſt the Kingdome: becauſe if he could not add to the Kings publicke puiſſance by adding to the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54658:10"/>
States wealth and honour, yet he could adde to the Kings private ſplendor, by depreſſing the States wealth, and honour. If the King did profeſſe that he ought to look upon the Community as having ends contrary to his true Soveraignty, and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe thereof, as inconſiſtent with his Legall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, then it were juſt and reaſonable that he did imbrace no Miniſters, but ſuch as were odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the people, nor purſue no ends but ſuch as were diſtructive to common Liberty. But ſince his profeſſions and oathes look an other way, t'is moſt wonderfull that in delegating of Officers <hi>Military</hi> Iudiciall, &amp;c. He ſhould ſo far abhor Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary advice, and approbation, and prefer all the miſeries of this bloudy warre before it: fot it were better for us that Parliamentary advice, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation were rejected in all other things, then in the placeing of publicke Miniſters, upon whoſe rule the welfare of the State more depends then upon any other Act of Royalty it ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we are not utterly miſtaken in point of Law, the great Officers of the Chancery, Admiralty, Treaſury and others, that are more properly the Kingdomes, then the Kings Miniſters, are to be choſen in Parliament: and if the Law in ſpeciall terms were not ſuch, yet by generall intendment of law all arduous affaires of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54658:10"/>
generall and great importance are to be tranſacted by the Common Counſell of the Land. Now wee well know, that the chuſing of publick Officers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der good Kings, which will not chuſe a miſſe, is not of ſo generall, and great importance, as it is under perverted <hi>Princes,</hi> who will chuſe none but ſuch as ſhall imploy all their abilities and endowments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the State, and to the diſſervice of the people; Lawyers and Devines ſeldome diſtinguiſh rightly betwixt that power of the King which is inveſted in him by abſolute donation, and that which is meerely fiduciary. Neither doe they diſtinguiſh betwixt that power which is originally intruſted to the King, by the fundamentall conſtitution of this Kingdome, and that which is occaſionally by intermiſſion or non-uſer left to the King at ſuch or ſuch times upon ſpeciall confidence of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But policy muſt needs teach us, that no State can be long ſafe where all Kings are equally truſted, and enabled, where the ſame King ſhall injoy that for ever as apperteyning to his undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Prerogative, which at any one time he has gayned, or wreſted from the people by his owne fraud, or force; or perhaps by the peoples negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, or indulgence to his wiſe predeceſſors. Without all queſtion, many ſmaller matters are
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54658:11"/>
intruſted to the Kings meere diſcretion, but yet <hi>quateus</hi> ſmaller matters onely. Whereas if the ſame things become greater matters, as they may, then the peoples right is not to be prejudged, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Law of publicke ſafety is above all Lawes of Prerogative, or any other laws whatſoever. For example, if <hi>J. S.</hi> be to cutt of the intayle of his Land in Parliament; the King by his negative voice may oppoſe him at his pleaſure: but if judgement be to be given againſt ſuch a notorious traitour t'is otherwiſe; and yet even ſuch a iudgment too is not alwayes alike: for in times of great diſtreſſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be retarded, interrupted, or denied; becauſe of the extrea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>c hazard to the State, &amp; in ſuch caſe the King has leſſe colour to pretend to a negative voice then at other times of more ſecurity: for as that which is of greater concernment, is not ſo much within the Kings pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er as that which is of leſſer, ſo that which is of leſſer concernment at one time in one reſpect, is of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at an other time in an other reſpect. And if Lawyers find not theſe diſtinctions in their reports, and yeare books, or if Devines find them not in the old Fathers, or in their Cannons of the Church, they muſt not forbid other men that ſtudie the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſecall Rules of State, to make uſe of more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54658:11"/>
knowledge, then that which their bookes afford. The <hi>Biſhop of Armach</hi> has declared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in point of iudgement againſt the Parliament; I ſhall onely demand of him whether he thinks himſelfe wiſer then the Lawes of England, or whether he thinks himſelfe wiſer in the Lawes of <hi>England</hi> then the maior part of both Houſes in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. One of theſe he muſt affirme. Maſter <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne</hi> his iudgement does not concurre with the Parliaments in ſuch a point of Law. I ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of him, whether Law muſt needs obſerve one rule in all caſes of publicke and of private mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or whether we are reſtrained from all equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table diſtinctions, and interpretations except ſuch as we find in Fitz <hi>Herbert, Cooke</hi> and <hi>Plowden?</hi> or whether his or the Parliaments reſolution herein be more authenticall? ſurely t'were in vaine to trouble all our Counties, Cities, and Burroughs with ſuch Ludibrious elections, if ſome one <hi>Biſhop</hi> or one <hi>Barriſter</hi> could declare Law better then thoſe which enacted it, or enact Law better then thoſe for whom all Law was ordayned. The Kingdome it ſelf taken in it's diffuſive body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not convene in any one place, nor fix upon any
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54658:12"/>
one certane reſolution, otherwiſe in all extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary caſes, and iudgements, the finall deciſion ought to proceed from thence, therefore it muſt be formed into ſuch an Artificiall body as is fitt to convene, and to deliberate. And being ſo formed, it has in it all the perſection, and excellence of the defuſive body. Tis true, the King may be held a repreſentative of the people in ordinary caſes, for avoiding of a more troubleſome convention, but in extraordinary caſes when ſuch a convention is neceſſary, the Parliament is the onely true repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative, and congregated to the King for more perfection ſake, or elſe it were vainly congregated. And becauſe the people cannot be congregated at all, much leſſe in any more perfect forme then in a Parliament, therefore the peoples utmoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is truly reſiding in the Parliament. Let not then any private man, Let not the King himſelfe undertake to define how far Regall power ſhall extend in iudiciall or Military affaires (as ſuch a perticular poſition of things may happen, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all emergences) better then the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative body of the Kingdome, which in no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect ought to be held any other thing then the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54658:12"/>
whole Kingdome it ſelf: much leſſe let it be held a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Law, or diſparagable to the King, to hearken to his Parliament, in the choice of State Officers, when ſo great a flux of Proteſtant Engliſh bloud is to be ſtanched thereby. If the King would exempt us from fear, and therefore ſwears that he may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt us, and yet will neither ſuffer us to chuſe Confidents for him, nor ſwear for ſuch as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſhall chuſe, when our fears are chiefly groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon them, either his intentions will ſeeme fraudulent, or his oathes nugatory; beſides our fears now cauſe us to look upon our Enemies not meerely as men that have a power in the Kings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but as men that are likely to have a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over the Kings Armes, and when the King per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may want protection for himſelf (if ſome timely prevention be not uſed,) how will he be able to protect us? T'is poſſible for an Army com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> ſtrangers and thoſe of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary trade of war, not onely to awe us, but ſuch alſo as firſt rayſed them againſt us. Abſolute Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire ends not (as is expected) in the freedome, but in the ſervitude of him, which ſores to the higheſt pich of it. If the Pretorian Legions ſet <hi>Caeſars</hi> foot
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54658:13"/>
upon the Senates neck, they will ſo far ſet their owne feet upon <hi>Caeſars</hi> neck, as to ſell the <hi>Empire</hi> when they pleaſe, and to whom they pleaſe; A hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Nations remaine in bondage to one Grand ſignior by meanes of the <hi>Janizaries,</hi> and yet thoſe <hi>Janizaries</hi> retaine to themſelves a Supream con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll over the Grand ſignior himſelf. The <hi>French</hi> King inioyes an arbitrary Prerogative more intirely, and more cheape then any <hi>Prince</hi> that I have read of, becauſe he neither relyes meerely upon an Army, nor meerely upon the Nobleſſe of that State whereby to oppreſſe the Peſantry, but very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly he ſo makes uſe of both, as that he is totally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to neither. But that Crowne has not of late ſuffered any violent ſhock, or concuſſion, if ever it does, that frame of Government will ſoone be ſhattered, and the great body of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity will gaine a party either amongſt the Nobleſſe or the Souldiary. When <hi>Marqueſſe Hartford</hi> firſt ſtrained himſelf, to bring in Forces for <hi>Prince Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert</hi> he did not perhaps intend to make <hi>Prince Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert</hi> ſo imperious over himſelf, &amp; over all our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Nobility, as he is now growne. Neither did Sir <hi>Ralph</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:54658:13"/>
               <hi>Hopton</hi> thinke by all his meritorious ſervices to gaine ſuch a Rivall to himſelfe, and to all the Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> as Captaine <hi>Leg.</hi> But now I feare they are ſubject to more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limitable Lords in the Campe, then ever they ſtomached in the Parliament. I pray God the King himſelfe do not finde the like. His Majeſtie needs no forraine diſcovery by Sir <hi>William Boſwells</hi> Letters, to advertiſe him of dangers, and conſpiracies againſt his ſacred Perſon, the deſignes of the Jeſuites (if they proſper, as by favour at Court they are likely) can never end but in the ruine of himſelfe, or of the Religion which he profeſſes, there need to be no ſtrange Intelligencer to informe his Majeſtie of this. We may then knit up this point in a more ſhort diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: Somtimes Princes are voluntarily in bondage to their owne Creatures, as <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> was, who whileſt he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled all <hi>Athens,</hi> and <hi>Athens</hi> over-ruled all <hi>Greece,</hi> yet he was himſelfe over-ruled by his wife, and his wife was over-ruled by her ſon: but this kinde of bondage is commonly more Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall. At other times, Princes ſtand ingaged to the factions and forces by which their Dominions were atchieved, and muſt be ſupported, and this kinde of engagement uſes to be often very Tragicall; as the old Stories of the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, and the moderne Stories of the Turkiſh Sultans, and of ſundry other inſolent uſurpers in other nations do ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently teſtifie. It behooves Princes therefore, as well for their Subjects, as their owne ſakes, to avoid either of theſe ſervile Conditions: let them not impoſe too heavie a yoke upon their Subjects, and they ſhall neither have cauſe, nor diſpoſition to receive any other yoke upon themſelves. But though theſe additionall cauſes are free from exception in themſelves, yet as the caſe now ſtands, and as the Kings ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of late hath been, ſome men may cavill perhaps, and oppoſe the taking of this Oath at this time. I ſhall reply lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle herein<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it appears, as I conceive, that this Oath, as it is now formed, does but open and explain the ſame intention
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54658:14"/>
which the King had, or ought to have had in the other: and therefore without great imputation, and ſuſpicion this forme cannot be refuſed. I ſhall onely ſupplicate his Majeſtie, that he will pleaſe yet more ſolicitouſly, and intentively, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view and reſearch the true ſtate of this tranſcendent Caſe, and to come to a more equall impartiall debate about it, as well with other men, as with his own conſcience: Let it be his Majeſties care to hear whatſoever can be inforced by reaſon from any perſon whatſoever, let him put the Caſe all maner of ways, &amp; take a juſt conſideration, in what condition he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, if his Cauſe be juſt, or if it be unjuſt, or if it be dubious, or partly juſt, and partly unjuſt; if he does not caſt thus about in ſpight of all prejudice, and take in all ſuppoſitions from all ſides, as the fatality of this controverſie now ſtands, no excuſe will be large enough to cover him from the condemnation of God or man. We will firſt ſuppoſe his Majeſties Cauſe to be juſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he has onely the defenſive part, and is neceſſitated to fight, and that the Parliament as yet hath offered no terms of Accommodation to him, but ſuch as are more unjuſt, then all the plagues of this calamitous war. This, ſo being ſuppoſed, makes him innocent, but yet moſt unfortunate, it makes him the firſt man that ever Fortune pickt out to ingage in ſuch a wretched deſtruction of men and treaſure without blame. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt all his Anceſtors there will not appear, upon ſearch, one of them who was juſt, and maintained a juſt cauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet met with ſuch generall oppoſition from his Subjects, much leſſe from the Lords and Commons aſſembled in Parliament: How triviall ſoever the Kings ſide account this, there was not ever a worſe prodigie in the world to amaze any State, then this is, if it be true that the orderly preſentative Body of this Nation, has, cauſleſly, and unnaturally, riſen up againſt their righteous king to purſue him ſo far, as ours now is. It is not to be denied, but that ſome Parliaments have done ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt things, when they have been wrought upon by the force or fraud of Princes; but no example can be ſhewed, that ever any
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54658:14"/>
Parliament did ſuch an unjuſt thing as this, contrary to all motives and influences of a gracious and religious Prince. Some of the kings party have argued thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if Parliaments may erre when they are perfect, having the concurrence of the Royall State with them, much more may they erre when the Royall State recedes from them, &amp;c. But this I hold a grand miſtake, for if I have any reaſon to make a right uſe of Story, Parliaments are repreſented to me never leſſe liable to error, then when they receive leaſt impreſſions from the king. With what regret then ought the king to look upon this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precedented dyſaſter? Certainly, if he look upon us with a naturall eye, under ſuch unparalleled ſufferings, or upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with a pious eye, under ſuch an unequalled affliction, it cannot but adminiſter thoughts of horrour to him. <hi>Bonus Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor ponit vitam pro ovibus,</hi> ſo ſaid that Prince of Peace, in whom onely there was no ſin, and in whoſe flock, joyntly, and ſeverally taken, there was nothing elſe but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in, and yet his death ſealed as much as his mouth affirmed. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſeemed to preferre the well-fare of the obſtinate Jews, not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all his temporall intereſts, but alſo before his eternall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adem in heaven; and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſeemed to be rapt up with a ſpecies of the ſame zeale. The paſſions of ſome heathen and hereticall Princes towards their liege Subjects, have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt above the pitch of humanity: with what a ſtrange kinde of hypochondriacall frenzie did <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> cry out, <hi>Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de mihi Legiones Vare?</hi> If the bloud of his Subjects had been drawn forcibly out of his own deareſt veins, it could not have parted from him with a ſtronger reſentment. How did our Queen <hi>Mary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> even to the death, deplore the loſſe of one Town in <hi>Picardie?</hi> With what ſtrange inſtruments did griefe make inciſion in her heart, whileſt it would in grave the name of <hi>Callice</hi> there? The loſſe of all kings in all wars uſes to be very dolorous, but native kings in civil wars, when they look upon ſuch vaſt deſolation, as is now to be ſeen in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> muſt needs think that their own intereſt, their own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54658:15"/>
their own ſaftie is of leſſe conſequence. We will now ſuppoſe the kings Cauſe to be unjuſt, that the Parliament has had none but loyall intentions towards him, and his Royall Dignity, nor has attempted any thing but to defend Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion againſt the Papiſts, the Lawes of the Land againſt Delinquents, and the Priviledges of both Houſes againſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants: and on the contrary we will ſuppoſe that that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Councell which the king has followed rather then his publike one, has aimed at the Arbitrary rule of <hi>France,</hi> and to effect the ſame has countenanced Popery, and but pretended danger onely from the Parliament, from the City of <hi>London,</hi> and from the beſt affected of the whole Kingdom. <hi>Qui ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponit, non ponit:</hi> We will not aſſume, but preſume onely that the great Councell of the Land is in the right rather then the King, and his clandeſtine Councell; but ſee what will follow upon this ſuppoſition, if it prove to be true, as it is neither impoſſible, nor improbable; if this be true, what a formidable day is that to be, wherein the king ſhall render a ſtrict account for all the Engliſh Proteſtant blood which ha's heen iſſued out, and is to be yet iſſued out in this wicked unnaturall quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell? <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> which filled Jeruſalem with blood, and made the kennells thereof flow with the precious blood of Saints, could not contract ſo black a guilt, as he that imbrues two large kingdomes with blood, and that with the blood of the beſt reformed Profeſſors of our Saviours Goſpell. That blood of Proteſtants which has been ſhed by Papiſts, as in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſian maſſacre; that blood of Chriſtians which has been ſhed by Infidells, as in Turkie; that blood of Saints which ha's been ſhed by Hereticks, as in the Arian Emperors dayes; that blood of ſtrangers which ha's been ſhed by Conquering Uſurpers, as in <hi>Peru</hi> of late, may admit of ſome colour, or excuſe as to ſome degree of hainouſneſſe, and may plead for ſome kinde of expiation, but this is beyond all thought or expreſſion: The goodly kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> is almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into a <hi>Golgotha,</hi> and the more goodly kingdom of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:54658:15"/>
is haſting to a worſe point of deſolation: It muſt needs be therefore, that he to whoſe cruelty and injuſtice ſo much confuſion ſhal be imputed, muſt be perpetually abominated as a plague of humane kinde more monſtrous, and portentuous then any age formerly had the ſtrength to produce. The rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping up of a mothers womb, the firing of ſuch a Metropolis as <hi>Rome</hi> was, were but ſtraines of vulgar, narrow-hearted cruelty; Antichriſt himſelf may own the depopulation, and vaſtation of our Brittiſh Ilands, as acts worthy of his dying fury.</p>
            <p>But it remaines now in the laſt place that we ſuppoſe ſome doubt to be in the caſe, or ſome mixture of injuſtice in ſome circumſtances: as that, though the King incline not at all to Popery himſelfe, yet he has favoured<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and enabled Papiſts too farre to do miſchiefe; and though he cannot with ſafety caſt himſelfe wholly upon the fidelity of the Parliament: yet he has no cauſe utterly to reject their conſent, and approbation in the filling up of all places of publike power and truſt as the emergent neceſſity of the times now is, nor to perſiſt in this all-conſuming war, rather then to condeſcend to an Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation of that nature; if we lay down but this for ſuppoſed, we muſt needs conclude that the King ha's not punctually and duly diſcharged his Office, ſo as that he can clearly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit, and abſolve himſelfe before God of this lamentable effuſion of Chriſtian blood: For there muſt not onely be a perſpicuous juſtice in the Cauſe, but an abſolute neceſſity of the war, when kings take up the ſword againſt ſuch a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number of their Subjects as our King now fights a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt. Though the cauſe may be juſt, yet the war is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full where the miſerable conſequences of it do too far out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballance the iniquity of the conditions offered, and propoſed by the aſſailed partie; wherefore if the meere and cleere juſtice of a cauſe cannot alwayes wipe off guilt, how ſhall he be purged from offence, whoſe cauſe is not totally juſt, nor undeniably evident in a war of this nature? If the King does
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54658:16"/>
not apparently fight for Antichriſt, yet tis moſt apparent that Antichriſt does fight for the King, the whole Hierarchy ha's declared their ingagement by publiſhing Bulls, &amp; by ſending ſupplies into <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp; <hi>England</hi> out of ſeverall Popiſh Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries: On the other ſide if the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> does not apparently fight for Chriſt, yet it ſeems very probable that Chriſt fights for him, for our great Armies within the circle of this laſt year have four times met, and ſtil the Kings ſide hath gone off with loſſe and diſadvantage. <hi>Redding</hi> being begirt with his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies forces, all his Majeſties power could not relieve it, yet <hi>Gloceſter</hi> being begirt by his Majeſties forces, his Excellency found meanes to relieve it. And as for <hi>Edge-hill</hi> and <hi>Newbery,</hi> though neither ſide was totally routed, yet the maſtery of the field was left to his Excellency, and had not fraud done better ſervice to the King then force, ſcarce any other encounters in other parts had been proſperous to his Popiſh Armies. Theſe things ſeem to make the kings Cauſe at leaſt dubious, for it were ſtrange if in theſe latter dayes Chriſt and Antichriſt ſhould be ſo far reconciled in any one cauſe as to unite their battailes in the ſame expedition, or to pitch their tents in the ſame field; and grant any doubt in this caſe, and the king can never be capable of juſtification in proſecuting it ſo far with fire and ſword; for the king has already ſworne to uphold and preſerve in their intire vigor the Lawes of the Land, and the Priviledges of Parliament, and we cannot deny but even this doubt might be decided by the Lawes in Parliament, or by ſome other Judicatory out of Parliament, if the king would referre it to ſuch a deciſion; if the king will admit of no Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory to determine this matter, what are all our Laws, and Priviledges worth? If he will admit of one, but doubts what it is, and will not be reſolved by his Parliament in that doubt, what will all his oathes profit us, what will all his deep profeſſions of favour to our Laws and Priviledges ſtand us in ſtead? All thoſe ſuppoſitions ſeverally or joyntly make it manifeſt, that this war, if it can be ended by a juſt oath on
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54658:16"/>
the kings ſide, not at all departing from the ſenſe, and intent of his former Oaths, or from the nature of his kingly office, will charge all theſe inexpiable miſchiefes upon him, if it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed: Nay, when the king is not certaine of Victory, and yet hath by ſo many dreadfull oathes debarred himſelf from all advantages by victory, if this devouring war (wherein ſo much loſſe is, and no gaine at all to countervaile it) be ſtill protracted, and preferred before a compoſition of this nature, future ages muſt needs ſuſpect, that love of ruine, and diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and a perfect hatred to the very nature, and being of man was the execrable cauſe of it: To recommend this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode of Pacification to the king, I ſhall ſay no more, and to recommend it now to the Parliament, very little will be fit to be ſaid, in regard that kings are more devoyd of Counſaile, then Parliaments; I ſhall thus onely contract my ſelfe.</p>
            <p>If we have reſpect to Almighty God, an appeale to him by Oath, is not leſſe beſeeming Chriſtianity then an appeale by ſword; for ought I can underſtand, this is rather a way of ingaging divine Juſtice, then of diſingaging it, if we may be permitted to uſe ſuch a word. If we have reſpect to the king, no courſe can better ſave his honour or oblige his juſtice then this.</p>
            <p>If we have reſpect to the Parliament, no other argument can more clearly vindicate their innocency and loyalty then this.</p>
            <p>If we have reſpect to Precedents, this is a tranſaction of State exceeding ancient.</p>
            <p>If we have reſpect to the preſent occaſion, our affaires are now in a condition ſo good, that fear cannot be upbraided to us, and the Summer is ſo far ſpent, and our ſucceſſe hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been ſo equilibrious, that we have no reaſon to preſume.</p>
            <p>If we have reſpect to the future, as the Armies may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band without turmoile, ſo we may all meet and incorporate again by this meanes upon more equall and friendly termes
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54658:17"/>
then by any other. The old word of Command (<hi>As you were</hi>) will reduce us to that Poſture, in which the beginning of this Parliament found us; and then if the King obſerve this oath, he will incline to favour a due reformation, and conſequently decline thoſe rocks upon which he ha's of late unpolitickly both caſt himſelf, and the State; if he obſerve it not, no new advantage will accrue to him by this disbanding of both Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but perhaps diſadvantages, rather; and certainly he will neither ingratiate himſelfe with God nor man by temerating ſuch a Sacred Paction.</p>
            <p>The cauſe of all our miſeries is meer obſtruction of juſtice, and ſuch obſtruction as nothing could worke but the utmoſt power of a king: Now for the opening of obſtructions, this oath, if it be kept unviolated, is as effectuall as any other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient whatſoever; and we may hope that it will be kept.</p>
            <p>But ſoft, I crave pardon for ſaying ſo much, or inſiſting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any inducements at all, for I know both Scots and Engliſh are now intereſſed herein, and I repreſent theſe things to the ſupreame wiſdom of two the moſt religious Kingdomes in the world.</p>
