            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

VINDICATION
OF THE
Hiſtoriographer
OF
The Univerſity of OXFORD,
And his Works, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE Prefacer to the Firſt Volume
of <hi>Athenae Oxonienſes,</hi> (now an
Eminent Proficient in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law,) ſaith, Firſt, <q>It is
well known, that the Author
of that Work hath through the whole courſe
of his Life declined the purſuit of any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
intereſt, or advantage, and hath only,
according to his Abilities, endeavoured to
promote the Honour and Glory of that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
wherein he had been Born, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93167:4"/>
of that Univerſity wherein he was E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducated.
His Early Application, or as ſome
call it, his Natural Propenſity to Hiſtories and
Antiquities, made him more fit to ſerve his
Country in that, than in any other Study;
and that part of Antiquity which was moſt
uſeful in it ſelf, and which yet lay moſt neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
became the immediate object of his
Care, as that which not only deſerved, but
required and wanted the greateſt Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Firſt product of his Labours and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Studies was, <hi>The Hiſtory and Antiquities of
the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of</hi> Oxford, which being by him
wrote in <hi>Engliſh</hi> in his Juvenile Years, it pleaſed
the Chief Heads of the ſaid Univerſity to have
it put into <hi>Latin,</hi> that the Learned World
might know and be acquainted with the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
Honour and Glory thereof: Which, had
it been done by a <hi>Scribler,</hi> or <hi>poor Writer,</hi> as
his Lordſhip of <hi>Salisbury</hi> is pleaſed to Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cterize
the Author in his <hi>Letter,</hi> p. 9. they
would not in the leaſt have taken notice of it;
nor would a certain<note n="*" place="bottom">

ſtiled it Four Years before it was Publiſhed, <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
aureolus plurimo labore nec minori judicio con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fignatus,</hi>
&amp;c. It was a Book of Eight Years
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93167:4"/>
Labour, and all, or moſt part of it, was Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
from the very Bowels of Antiquity, as
the many Quotations from Records and Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts
in every Page thereof do ſhew. It
hath afforded matter for many Eminent Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
whether Domeſtick, or Foreign, who
have made Honourable mention of it, and its
Author, as thoſe who are Bookiſh Men (who
have frequently ſtiled it, <hi>A Choice Treaſure of
Antiquities,)</hi> do know very well.</p>
            <p>After it was finiſhed, the Curators of the
<hi>Sheldonian</hi> Preſs, namely, Sir <hi>Leoline Jenkins,</hi>
Sir <hi>Joſeph Williamſon,</hi> Dr. <hi>John Fell,</hi> (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Biſhop of <hi>Oxon,)</hi> and Dr. <hi>Tomas Yate,</hi>
did Dedicate it to His Majeſty King <hi>Charles</hi> the
Second, to whom being preſented at <hi>Windſor</hi> in
<hi>July,</hi> 1674, by Dr. <hi>Richard Alleſtry</hi> Provoſt of
<hi>Eaton</hi> College, His Majeſty was graciouſly
pleaſed to accept of it, turn over ſeveral parts
thereof, and hold ſome Conference about it with
that Learned Doctor, as the Author of it was by
his Letters informed. Soon after the Heads of
the Univerſity of <hi>Oxon,</hi> agreed, that as many
Copies that Coſt Eighty Pounds ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the great Perſons of the Royal Court,
of the Clergy, and of the Law. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it was preſented, in the Name of the
ſaid Univerſity, (1.) To the moſt illuſtrious
Prince <hi>John William</hi> Prince of <hi>Neoburg,</hi> when
he was Entertained by the Members thereof in
the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> 1675. See in the <hi>Faſti</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:93167:5"/>
of the Second Volume of <hi>Athenae Oxon.</hi> p. 871.
(2.) To the moſt illuſtrious Prince <hi>Coſmo de
Medicis,</hi> the great Duke of <hi>Tuſcany;</hi> to whom
the ſaid <hi>Hiſt. &amp; Antiq.</hi> was ſent by the Decree
of the Venerable Convocation of the Doctors
and Maſters, held on the Seventh of <hi>October,</hi>
1675, and with it a <hi>Latin</hi> Letter Pen'd by the
Publick Orator, wherein a Juſt and Laudable
Character was given of the ſaid Book, as it
appears in the Regiſter of the Acts of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.
The ſaid Duke had been entertained
by the Univerſity of <hi>Oxon,</hi> when he came to
ſee it, and its Glories, in the beginning of <hi>May,</hi>
1669. (3.) To <hi>Charles Maurice le Tellier</hi>
Archbiſhop and Duke of <hi>Rheimes,</hi> when he
and other <hi>French</hi> Nobility viſited the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
It was preſented by the Hands of Doctor
<hi>Fell</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Oxon,</hi> the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1677.
(4.) To his Royal Highneſs <hi>James</hi> Duke of
<hi>York,</hi> when he was Entertained by the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> 1683. See in the
ſaid <hi>Faſti,</hi> p. 893, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To omit others, muſt
not be forgotten the moſt Illuſtrious and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Ld. <hi>Peter Sparr Fzee,</hi> Baron of <hi>Croneberg,</hi> &amp;c.
General of the Army of Foot belonging to the
King of <hi>Sweedland,</hi> and Extraordinary Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador
to the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> from the
ſaid King of <hi>Sweedland,</hi> who had a Copy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to him by the Heads, tho' not quite fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
at the Preſs, when he was Entertained

               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:93167:5"/>
Theſe Memoirs are purpoſely ſet down, that
the Reader might underſtand what value the
chief Members of the moſt Famous Univerſity
of <hi>Oxon</hi> had for that Book, which they deemed
a fit Preſent for a Prince, and other great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and that he might ſee that the Author
thereof was not a <hi>poor Writer,</hi> or <hi>Scribler,</hi> or
one <hi>who had no Reputation of loſe,</hi> as his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of <hi>Salisbury</hi> in his Letter before mention'd
tells you, <hi>p.</hi> 9, 10.</p>
            <p>The ſaid Book, wherein is maintained, by
ſeveral valid Arguments, the Antiquity of the
Univerſity of <hi>Oxon,</hi> againſt that of <hi>Cambridg,</hi>
remains as yet unanſwer'd: Nor is any part of
it Animadverted upon, but a Minute part, by
Doctor <hi>Gilbert Burnet</hi> in the firſt part of <hi>The
Hiſtory of the Reformation of the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
Printed at <hi>London,</hi> 1679, wherein, <hi>p.</hi> 85,
86. the Author ſpeaking of the Divorce of
Queen <hi>Catherine</hi> from King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth,
makes theſe Animadverſions following on the
ſaid part in <hi>Hiſt. &amp; Antiq. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niv. Oxon.</hi> lib 1.
p. 256. <hi>a.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>The Collector of the Antiquities of <hi>Oxford,</hi>
informs us of the uneaſineſs of this matter,
<hi>(the Divorce,)</hi> and of the ſeveral Meſſages
the King ſent before that Inſtrument, <hi>(mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Act, or Decree of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity, in
order to the Divorce,)</hi> could be procured. So
that from the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> to the <hi>8th</hi> of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93167:6"/>
                  <hi>April,</hi> the matter was in Agitation, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of Arts generally oppoſing it, tho' the
Doctors and Heads were (for the greateſt
part) for it. But after he has ſet down the
Inſtrument, he gives ſome Reaſons (upon
what deſign I cannot eaſily imagine) to ſhew
that this was extorted by force; and being
done without the conſent of the Maſters of
Arts, was of its ſelf void and of no force.
And, as if it had been an ill thing, he takes
pains to purge the Univerſity of it, and lay
it upon the Fears and Corruptions of ſome
Aſpiring Men of the Univerſity: And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any proof gives Credit to a Lying Story
ſet down by <hi>Sanders,</hi> of an Aſſembly called by
Night, in which the Seal of the Univerſity
was ſet to the Determination; but it appears
that he had never ſeen, or conſidered the
other Inſtrument to which the Univerſity ſet
their Seal, that was agreed on in Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all the Doctors and Maſters, as well Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
as Non-Regents; giving power to theſe
Doctors and Bachelors of Divinity to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the matter, and to ſet the Seal of the
Univerſity to their concluſion. The Original
whereof the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> ſaw, upon which
the Perſons ſo deputed had full Authority to
ſet the Univerſity's Seal to that concluſion;
perhaps that Inſtrument was not ſo carefully
preſerved among their Records, or was in
Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Days taken away, which might
occaſion theſe Miſtakes in their Hiſtorian.</p>

There ſeems alſo another Miſtake in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
he gives, for he ſays, thoſe of <hi>Paris</hi>
had determined in this matter before it was
agreed to at <hi>Oxon.</hi> The Printed Deciſion of
the <hi>Sorbone</hi> contradicts this, for it bears Date
the Second of <hi>July,</hi> whereas this was done the
Ninth of <hi>April,</hi> 1530, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Thus the Church Hiſtorian, ſoon after the
Author, or Collector of <hi>the Antiquities of</hi> Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,
Examining the ſaid Animadverſions on
that little part of his Book before mention'd, he
divided them into ſeveral pieces, and made
Anſwer to each, but were not then Printed.
The Contents of which, and the Anſwers follow.</p>
            <q>—But after he hath ſet down the Inſtrument,
he gives ſome Reaſons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>The Two firſt Reaſons (if they may be ſo
called) were put in by another hand, and the
other were taken by the Author from theſe
Three Books following, <hi>viz.</hi> (1.) From <hi>A Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
of Marriage,</hi> &amp;c. written by Doctor <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las
Harpesfield,</hi> which is a Folio Manuſcript, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
either in the time of Queen <hi>MARY,</hi> or in
the beginning of Queen <hi>ELIZABETH,</hi> and
'tis by him quoted in the place excepted againſt.
(2.) From <hi>The Life of Queen</hi> Catherine, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by <hi>William Foreſt</hi> in the Reign of Queen
<hi>Mary,</hi> and Dedicated to Her. 'Tis alſo a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript,
and written in a fair Character on

of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of</hi> Oxon <hi>againſt King</hi>
Henry <hi>the Eighth,</hi> &amp;c. written by a Maſter of

therein, written to the Univerſity about the
Queſtion of Marriage and Divorce, with ſeveral
paſſages relating to Convocations and Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
concerning the ſaid Queſtion.</p>
            <p>So now you may ſee, that he did not frame,
or give thoſe Reaſons from his own Invention,
but from Authors of Credit in the time they
Lived.</p>
            <q>—(<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon what deſign I cannot eaſily imagin.)</q>
            <p>There was no deſign at all in the matter, but
only for Truth's ſake, which very few in theſe

            <q>—And, as if it were an ill thing, he takes
pains to purge the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>It was a very ill thing (as he thought) for a
King by his Letters to frighten Perſons out of
their Conſciences and Opinions, and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to force them (as 'twere) to ſay and do
what muſt pleaſe him: But foraſmuch as the
Maſters would not be frightned, and therefore
they were laid aſide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the matter diſcuſſed
and determined by a few Old Doctors, and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelors
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93167:7"/>
of Divinity, who would act and ſay
any thing to pleaſe the King, leſt danger ſhould
follow, they ought to be commended for keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Conſciences ſound, and ſtanding up for
that which they thought was Equity.</p>
            <q>—And without any Proof gives Credit to a
Lying Story ſet down by <hi>Sanders,</hi> of an Aſſembly
called by Night, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Sanders</hi> is not his Author, for he ſays no ſuch

unſeaſonable, and all their Actions Clancular,
as having been proteſted againſt by, and done

things in his Book <hi>De Schiſmate,</hi> eſpecially
thoſe relating to the Univerſity of <hi>Oxon,</hi> he
finds, from other places, to be true.</p>
            <q>—But it appears, that he had never ſeen

The grand Collection, or <hi>Farrago,</hi> which
Mr. <hi>Thomas Maſter,</hi> of <hi>New-College,</hi> drew up by
the Lord <hi>Herbert</hi>'s appointment, in order to
write the <hi>Life of King</hi> Henry <hi>the Eighth,</hi> he
had ſeen and peruſed, but could not with all his
diligence find that Inſtrument, Act, or Decree
of Convocation, neither in the Three great <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio</hi>'s
written by another Hand, containing Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials
at large for the writing the ſaid <hi>Life,</hi>
neither in any of the Regiſters, Records, or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
belonging to the Univerſity: So that for
thoſe Reaſons, and becauſe that the Lord <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi>
ſays, that <hi>it was blurred, and not intended
for the King,</hi> and that alſo it was not under
Seal (you ſay 'twas) neither paſſed in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority
of Votes, therefore did he omit it, as
not Authentick. Truly he had good ground to
think, that it was only drawn up, and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed;
for if it had been propoſed, it would
have been Regiſtred, there being nothing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
either in Convocation, or Congregation,
but is Regiſtred, whether denied or not: And
the Regiſter of that time is moſt exactly kept,
and nothing, as he could perceive, hath been
tore out.</p>
            <q>—There ſeems to be another Miſtake in the
Relation he gives, for he ſays, thoſe of <hi>Paris</hi> had
determined in this matter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>He ſays it not, for it was ſaid by <hi>M. Warham</hi>
Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> then Chancellour of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93167:8"/>
the Univerſity, in his Letters thereunto, <hi>To
make what Expedition they could to give in their
Anſwer to the King's Queſtion, foraſmuch as</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris
<hi>and</hi> Cambridge <hi>had done it already.</hi> For
this matter he Quotes the Book of <hi>Epiſtles</hi> ſent
from, and to the Univerſity of <hi>Oxon,</hi> which
is a Manuſcript in the Archieves of <hi>Bodley</hi>'s Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary,
<hi>Epiſt.</hi> 197. Yet he believes the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
ſaid thoſe things to haſten the Members
of the Convocation of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxon</hi>
the more, tho' probably it was not ſo. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he was not bound to take notice of that,
but to follow Record as he had found it: And
that he doth follow Record throughout his Book,
there is not one (as he preſumes) of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
Senate of <hi>Antiquaries,</hi> or <hi>Hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,</hi>
can deny it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Thus far the Anſwer to the Animadverſions
of the <hi>Church Hiſtorian,</hi> made on a little part of
<hi>Hiſt. &amp; Antiq. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niv.</hi> Oxon. Now foraſmuc has
the ſaid <hi>Church-Hiſtorian</hi> doth often quote and
make uſe of ſeveral Manuſcripts and Records in
the <hi>Cottonian</hi> Library, it would be well worth
the Curioſity of ſome Perſons, to Enquire why
he did not make uſe of a certain Volume in that
Library, under <hi>Fauſtina, c.</hi> 7. containing Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
ſent from, and Copies of Charters, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxon:</hi> In
which Letters are ſeveral Matters relating to
the Reformation of the ſaid Univerſity by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Commiſſioners appointed by King <hi>Henry</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:93167:9"/>
the Eighth, <hi>Anno</hi> 1535. To which may be
Anſwered, that there being many Vile things in
the ſaid Letters, which tend rather to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of the ſaid Univerſity, (a Nurſery to
ſupply the Church) they would have ſpoiled
the ſmooth Current of his <hi>Hiſtory of Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi>
And if ſo, as ſeveral Curious Perſons have
ſuppoſed, it doth, under favour, Argue much
Partiality; and he that is Partial, is not fit to
be an Hiſtorian. One paſſage, among the reſt,
I ſhall here ſet down, written by <hi>Nicholas Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
or <hi>Leighton,</hi> one of the Commiſſioners;
his Letter Dated the Twelfth of <hi>September,</hi>
1535, and directed to <hi>Thomas Cromwell</hi> Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
of State, (wherein is mention made of
ſome of the mad work they had done relating
to the Works of the Famous <hi>Joh. Duns Scotus,)</hi>
tells you thus, <q>We have ſet <hi>Dunce</hi> in <hi>Boccar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,
(meaning a Priſon in</hi> Oxon <hi>ſo called,)</hi> and
have utterly Baniſhed him <hi>Oxford</hi> for ever,
with all his blind Gloſſes, and is now made a
common Servant to every Man, faſt Nailed
up upon Poſts in all Common Houſes of
Eaſement, <hi>Id quod oculis meis vidi.</hi> And the
Second time we came to <hi>New-College,</hi> after
we had declared their Injunctions, we found
all the great Quadrant-Court full of the
Leaves of <hi>Dunce,</hi> the Winds blowing them
into every Corner, and there we found one
Mr. <hi>Greenfeld,</hi> of <hi>Buckingham-ſhire,</hi> gathering
part of the ſaid Book-Leaves (as he ſaid)
therewith to make him <hi>Scuels,</hi> or <hi>Blaunſheers,</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:93167:9"/>
to keep the Deer within the Wood, thereby
to have the better Cry with his Hounds,<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
Thus, <hi>Thomas Layton:</hi> Which things were
moſtly done by Dr. <hi>John London,</hi> another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner,
at that time Warden of <hi>New-College,</hi>
who ſpared not to Abuſe his Founder, College,
Univerſity, and his Conſcience, to gain Favour
from great Perſons, and Wealth into his
Purſe.</p>
            <p>If ſo be the ſaid Commiſſioners had ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpect
for that moſt famous Author <hi>J. Duns,</hi>
who was ſo much admired by our Predeceſſors,
and ſo difficult to be underſtood, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of thoſe times, namely Dr. <hi>William Roper,</hi>
Dr. <hi>John Kynton,</hi> Dr. <hi>William Mowſe,</hi> &amp;c. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
that in Twenty Eight Years Study, they
could not underſtand him rightly, (as <hi>John
Bale,</hi> an inveterate Enemy to that Author, and
<hi>Romaniſts,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">In his <hi>Myſtery of Iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. Printed at <hi>Geneva,</hi> in <hi>Octavo,</hi> Anno 1545, Fol. <hi>vel</hi> Pag. 26.</note> reports,) what then had they
for others of inferiour Note? Truly, I have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good reaſon to think, that the ſaid Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners
made ſad Havock in the Univerſity at
that time, and were not wanting, upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
to give an ill Report of Learning, and
Learned Men. So it was, that what the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of former times did Advance, and Cry up,
the Peeviſh and Baſe Humour of theſe (1535)
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93167:10"/>
did decry and run down, ſuch is the World's
Career.</p>
            <p>But now let's proceed, It has been a Wonder,
that among all the Members of the moſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Univerſity of <hi>Oxon,</hi> who have ſignaliz'd
their Learning and Induſtry in all Profeſſions,
and almoſt upon all Subjects, never have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
the Hiſtory of the Writers thereof, and of
Learning, till our <hi>Hiſtoriographer</hi> wrote the
<hi>Athenae</hi> and <hi>Faſti Oxon,</hi> the Firſt Volume of
which coming out in 1691, doth make the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Volume which he has written. It was
partly collected from Records, and Regiſters,
and ſome of it from the Works of Authors
who are therein mention'd. Another part from
Books written <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>con,</hi> and what concerns
the Death and Burial of Authors, is taken from
Epitaphs, Parochial and other Regiſters, or
from the <hi>Will,</hi> or <hi>Heralds-Office</hi> at <hi>London.</hi>
And laſtly, what is ſaid of ſuch Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick-Writers,
either in that, or the Second Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume,
who to enjoy their Religion in Peace and
Safety, have fled their Native-Country, is part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taken from the Regiſters of thoſe Colleges
and Houſes of Religion beyond the Seas, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they have ſettled, and ſpent their time, or
from the Epitaphs, or Inſcriptions on their
Graves. All which hath been communicated
to the Author by Letters from Perſons moſtly
unknown to him. Now whereas the Biſhop of
<hi>Salisbury</hi> ſaith in his Letter, <hi>p. 9. That he hath
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93167:10"/>
been viſibly made a Tool by ſome of the Church of</hi>
Rome, <hi>to Reproach all the greateſt Men of our
Church;</hi> is, under favour, not true, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
hath ſeveral times proteſted, and with
Zealous Imprecations declared his Innocency of
ſuch a matter, ſo much, that he is ready to
make Oath in any Court of Judicature, that he
hath not in the leaſt, either by Letter from, or
Diſcourſe with, any Roman Catholick, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Religious, or Laick, been deſired, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded,
or provoked to ſpeak any one thing of,
or againſt, a Writer, or Biſhop, or any Perſon
elſe, of the Proteſtant Perſuaſion.</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip, in that Character of the <hi>Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ographer</hi>'s
being made a <hi>Tool,</hi> hath ſeemed much
to incline to the vain Reports of ſome Men, and
hath received things too much upon truſt: For
had he enquired of ſeveral Perſons in <hi>Oxon</hi> of
known Worth and Truth, he would have
found him not to be ſo. But it ſeems thoſe juſt
Truths which he hath given of Trimmers and
Temporizers reliſhes not with many Men of
this Age.</p>
            <p>Furthermore alſo, whereas his Lordſhip doth
alledg, <hi>That he hath laid together all that the
Malice of Miſſionaries could furniſh him with, to
Blemiſh the Work of one of the greateſt Men of
our Church, Biſhop</hi> Jewell; is, under favour, a
miſtake, for he laid them not, but <hi>R Parſons</hi>
the Jeſuit, whom he Quotes for what he ſays:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93167:11"/>
And if any thing be ill ſaid of that Biſhop,
thoſe of <hi>Parſons</hi> his Party are to Anſwer for it,
while in the mean time the Author of the
<hi>Athenae Oxon</hi> is ſo far from ſpeaking ill of that
Worthy and Learned Biſhop, that he tells you
in that Book, <hi>That he was one of the greateſt
Lights that the Reformed Church of</hi> England
<hi>hath produced; that for his great Learning and
Sufferings he was made Biſhop of</hi> Salisbury <hi>by
Queen</hi> Elizabeth; and adds, with <hi>Cambden,</hi>
(who was no Miſſionary) <hi>That he was a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful,
great, and deep Divine, a moſt ſtout and
earneſt Maintainer of our Reformed Religion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Adverſaries of his Learned Books:
That he was a Man of ſingular Ingeny, of exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
Erudition in</hi> Theologicals, <hi>and of great Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,</hi>
&amp;c. what more can be ſaid? If this is not
enough, after an excellent Book written of his
Life by the Learned Dr. <hi>Lawrence Humphrey,</hi> I
know not what is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Truth is, which may be eaſily obſerved
by any ordinary Reader (not prejudiced) that
the Author of</hi> Athenae Oxon. hath written<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>So in</hi> The Works of the Learned, <hi>&amp;c. London, 1691. qu. p.</hi> 5.</note>
very impartially, and has related whatſoever he
knows, whether good or bad, of thoſe whoſe Lives
he writes. The Roman Catholicks are not better
uſed by him, than thoſe of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93167:11"/>
as may be ſeen in the Lives of many of
them in the Firſt Volume, among which are
thoſe of</hi> John Bekinſon, William Chiadſey, Edm.
Bonner, Thomas Harding, Henry Cole, Edm.
Campian, John Nicholls, Robert Parſons, <hi>and
others, whoſe great Mutability in Religion,
(which the Author of</hi> The works of the Learned
<hi>calls Hyprocriſie) he ſets down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second Volume of the <hi>Athenae Oxon,</hi>
which makes the Third Volume that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
hath Publiſhed, was collected as the Firſt,
<hi>viz.</hi> From Records, Regiſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In it
you'll find a great deal of the Myſtery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
Acted in that diſmal Rebellion which was
commenced by the Puritans, and other Factious
People, <hi>Anno</hi> 1642, opened and diſplayed. It
ſhews how thoſe Brethren were common
Preachers up of Treaſon and Rebellion, and
how their Pulpits were Eſteemed by Obſerving
Men, the Chairs of Juglers: That Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
Profanations, Abſurdities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were by
them vented every Day in their Extemporary
Prayers and Sermons, to the great blinding and
miſleading of the People. It ſhews how the
Men of thoſe times did turn themſelves, and
overturn all things, meerly for private Intereſt
and Gain. It ſhews alſo the Inſtability of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who then Swore and Forſwore for their
own Ends, made Religion a Stalking-Horſe, and
of Sacred Oaths, no more than common Knights
of the Poſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:93167:12"/>
Therein you'll find many paſſages relating to
the Life and Actions of that Bleſſed Martyr King
<hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, eſpecially for the Two laſt
Years of his Reign, which were never before
Publiſhed, and the Intriegues of many of the
Leading Men on the Rebels ſide, that were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on, in bringing that Pious Prince to the
Block. Therein you'll find great and generous
Senſe of Loyalty in the Author, and from his
Pen Juſt and Impartial Characters of the True
and Suffering Sons of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> as
alſo the Impartial Relations of ſuch as were not
ſo, moſtly taken from their own Books and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
or Pamphlets written by the Brethren,
or Royal Party. You'll alſo find therein the
Juſt Characters of many of the Nobility and
Gentry that adhered to the ſaid King when he
was at <hi>Oxon,</hi> and what not of Hiſtory that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
to that moſt Wicked and Barbarous Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
before-mention'd? You'll alſo find therein
many bold and undeniable Truths, which tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too cloſe on the heels of Time, ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
(whoſe Relations had been Actors in, or
ſubmitters to the Men in the ſaid unparallel'd
Rebellion,) have endeavoured to make them
Abuſes and Libels, thereby to bring the Author
into trouble.</p>
            <p>Both the Volumes of the <hi>Athenae</hi> and <hi>Faſti
Oxon,</hi> (which his Lordſhip of <hi>Salisbury</hi> calls a
<hi>deſpicable Book)</hi> are moſt exactly written ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to time; and the Author has been ſo
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93167:12"/>
punctual, that the very Day, and ſometimes
the Hour of a thing done, or of the Death of
a Writer, or Biſhop, is ſet down; and all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted
in ſo good and exact a Method, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of that Nature can poſſibly be done bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
And therefore why his Lordſhip of <hi>Saliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
ſhould ſay, <hi>That he has thrown together a
Tumultuary mixture of Stuff and Tattle,</hi> none in
<hi>Oxon</hi> can imagin it, or in the leaſt judge where
that <hi>Stuff and Tattle</hi> ſhould be lodged. Both
the ſaid Volumes will, without doubt, be of
great uſe to all Perſons of Literature, but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
to ſuch as apply themſelves to Hiſtory,
or Politicks, whom it concerns every Moment
to know what kind of Men were the Authors
of thoſe Books they Read. Neither is that
knowledg unneceſſary to all that Study; for as
the Writing of Authors may be ſaid <hi>to be the
Picture of the Mind,</hi> ſo to know their Life, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and moſt remarkable Actions, muſt
needs be <hi>a great help towards judging rightly of
their Sentiments.</hi> This being an infallible Truth,
it has been a wonder to many, why his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who hath written many
Lives (and many more) of Eminent Men,
and ſeems to have a peculiar Genius that way,
ſhould now endeavour to run down the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae</hi>
and <hi>Faſti Oxon,</hi> which conſiſts all, or moſt,
of Lives and Characters, and make it a <hi>deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
Book,</hi> and the Author a <hi>Scribler,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

curtail'd,</hi> &amp;c. The Author had from Mr.
<hi>Fulman</hi> himſelf, who related it ſeveral times
with reluctancy before him, and ſome of his
Collegiats of <hi>Chriſt-Church-College,</hi> and ſeemed
to Condole his Misfortune, that his Labours
and Lucubrations could not ſtand according to
his Mind, deſiring withal, that as the ſaid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor

of the Works of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt,
and obtaining Materials for the Writing of that
King's Life (the Glory of which, Dr. <hi>Richard
Perinchief</hi> carried away,) ſo he would be
pleaſed to do him right in the Work <hi>(Athenae
Oxon)</hi> that he was then Meditating, to let the
World know of <hi>the omitting and curtailing of
many of the ſaid Obſervations.</hi> All which, he
according to a promiſe then made, hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and thereby done right to the Memory
of his deceaſed Friend: Which being Juſt and
Equitable, and not unbecoming an Hiſtorian,
his Lordſhip of <hi>Salisbury</hi> needed not <hi>to expect to
ſee a Writer of his</hi> (Anthony Harmer'<hi>s) Rank
deſcend ſo low to Cite ſuch a Scribler, eſpecially
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93167:13"/>
upon ſuch an occaſion,</hi> &amp;c. Had it not been for
Mr. <hi>Harmer</hi>'s reference to a paſſage in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Volume of the <hi>Athenae Oxon.</hi> the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of a <hi>Scribler,</hi> and other moſt terrible things
of the <hi>Hiſtoriographer,</hi> would not have been
mention'd; but ſomething muſt be ſaid, let it
be never ſo unjuſt, leſt an Anſwer ſhould be
deficient, <hi>Et hinc Lachrymae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot but reflect on that ſort of Creature,
who when for their Snarling and Barking, a
Stone or a Stick is thrown at them, they turn
Tail to him that threw it, and fall with Teeth,
and Grins upon the poor Inſtrument of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
With Reverence be it ſpoken, there
is a great likeneſs in the preſent Caſe. Mr.
<hi>Harmer</hi> being a little offended with the Noiſe
made by the Writer of <hi>The Hiſtory of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi>
thought fit to caſt at him a paſſage out
of <hi>Athenae Oxon.</hi> Vol. 2. p. 625. Upon this
the Author of that Hiſtory turns away from
the Objecter, and falls upon the Book ſo Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to him, with ſo much Fury, that if the
Book had been burned, it had been better uſed.
But pray where's the Ingenuity of this Method
of Defence? Would any Court of Equity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
that when a Perſon ſtands Convicted of a
Crime by this or that Evidence, he ſhall not
inſiſt upon diſproof of the Teſtimony, but fall
upon the Witneſs, and call him Fool and Knave,
becauſe he dared to prove him guilty? If the
Writer of this <hi>Vindication had treated Mr.</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:93167:14"/>
Harmer <hi>with ſome Scorn and Contempt, it had not
affrighted him, nor deterr'd him from enquiring
further into the truth</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Preface to the <hi>Specimen of Errours,</hi> &amp;c. p. 7.</note> 
               <hi>of things.</hi> And
therefore it ſeems when he foreſaw his Scorn
and Contempt would be thrown away upon the
ſaid Mr. <hi>Harmer,</hi> he was reſolv'd to caſt it all
upon the By-ſtander, the Author of <hi>Athenae
Oxen.</hi> And it was wiſely done, not to provoke
the Man that wore the Sword, but to turn the
Affront upon the Naked Paſſenger. And he has
effectually done it upon one, who can digeſt a
Rude thing, and equally neglect Greatneſs and
Paſſion.</p>
            <p>The next matter that his Lordſhip of <hi>Saliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>
takes notice of, is, <hi>His Barbarous attacking
the Memory of his Predeceſſor Biſhop</hi> Ward, <hi>who
was in ſo many reſpects one of the greateſt Men of
his Age,</hi> &amp;c. What his Lordſhip means by
<hi>Barbarous attacking,</hi> is, no doubt, in his ſenſe
<hi>Abuſing,</hi> or <hi>Reporting Falſe things of him.</hi> If
ſo, then let the Reader know that what is ſaid,
being taken from Regiſter and Obſervation, is
as clear as the Sun at Noon: But I ſee Truth
muſt not be ſpoke at all times. Had his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
known Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> before His Majeſties Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtauration,
he would have been of another
Mind; but his knowledg of him, was not, I
preſume, till after he was a Biſhop, when then,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93167:14"/>
and to the time of his Death, he was eſteemed
a Good and Excellent Man. The Truth is, he
was a Man of Parts, and a great Royaliſt for a
time; but when he ſaw that King <hi>Charles</hi> the
Firſt was beheaded, and Monarchy never in a
poſſibility of returning again, then did
he change his Orthodox Principles,
ſubmit to the Men then in power, and
Eat the Bread of Two Royaliſts, (that had
been Ejected,) ſucceſſively. And tho' his
Friends ſay, that he never took the Oath cal<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed
the <hi>Engagement,</hi> yet it appears that he did ſo in
the Regiſter belonging to the Committee for the
Reformation of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxon,</hi> as I
was many Years ſince informed by the Clerk
belonging to that Committee.</p>
            <p>What his Life and Converſation was, while
he Lived in <hi>Oxon,</hi> the poor Remnant of the
Royaliſts that then remained there, would have
told you, who uſually ſaid, <hi>That had not Dr.</hi>
Ward <hi>degenerated from their Principles of Loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
he would not have laſhed out into ſeveral Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities,</hi>
&amp;c. for the doing of which, he alſo
loſt the Opinion that the then Saints in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
had of him.</p>
            <p>And now to conclude, I ſhall leave with you
the Character of the Author of the <hi>Athenae
Oxon.</hi> which is at the end of the Epiſtle to the
Reader, (of which but few were Printed,) ſet
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:93167:15"/>
before the Firſt Volume of the ſaid <hi>Athenae</hi> run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thus, <q>The Reader is deſired to know,
that this <hi>Herculean</hi> Labour had been more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for a Head, or Fellow of a College, or
for a Publick Profeſſor, or Officer of the
moſt Noble Univerſity of <hi>Oxon,</hi> to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken,
than the Author, who never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
any Place or Office therein, or can juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſay, that he hath Eaten the Bread of any
Founder. Alſo, that it had been a great deal
more fit for one who pretends to be a <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſo,</hi>
and to know all Men, and all things
that are Tranſacted: Or for one who fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents
much Society, where the Characters of
Men and their Works are frequently diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
but the Author, alas, is ſo far from fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting
ſuch Company, that he is as 'twere
Dead to the World, and utterly unknown in
Perſon to the generality of Scholars in <hi>Oxon.</hi>
He is likewiſe ſo great an Admirer of a Solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Retired Life, that he frequents no Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
of the ſaid Univerſity, hath no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
in Bed, or at Board, in his Studies,
Walks, or Journeys, nor holds Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with any, unleſs with ſome, and thoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
few, of Generous and Noble Spirits, that
have in ſome meaſure been promoters and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragers
of this Work: And indeed all
things conſidered, he is but a degree different
from an Aſcetick, as ſpending all or moſt of
his time, whether by Day or Night, in Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Writing, or Divine Contemplation.
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93167:15"/>
However, he preſumes, that the leſs his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
and Acquaintance is, the more Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
his Endeavours will appear to the Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and Learned, to whoſe Judgments only
he ſubmits them, and himſelf.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To which I ſhall add what I know beſides of
the ſame Author, <hi>viz.</hi> That he did never in
heat and forwardneſs meddle with a Subject,
to which he was not prepar'd by Education,
and a due Method of Studies: That he never
Wrote to oblige a Riſing Party, or to inſinuate
into the diſpoſers of Preferment; but has been
content with his Station, and aimed at no end
but Truth: That he never took up with the
Tranſcript of Records, where the Originals
might be conſulted: Nor made uſe of others
Eyes, when his own could ſerve: That he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Wrote in Poſt with his Body and his
Thoughts in a hurry, but in a fix'd Abode,
and with a deliberate Pen: That he never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd
an Ungrateful Truth, nor flouriſh'd over
a Weak Place, but in ſincerity of Meaning and
Expreſſion has thought an Hiſtorian ſhould be a
Man of Conſcience: That he has never had a
Patron to oblige, or forget, but has been a free
and independent Writer: And in a Word, that
he confeſſes there may be ſome Miſtakes in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
Things and Perſons, when he could have
no Evidence but from the information of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Friends, or perhaps Enemies: But he is
confident, that where Records are cited, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93167:16"/>
where Authentick Evidence could poſſibly be
had, there he has been Punctual and Exact.
And therefore he defies <hi>Anth. Harmer</hi> to Write
any one <hi>Specimen</hi> of Errours and Defects in his
Hiſtory; or if he can find out Eighty Nine, or
One Hundred, groſs Miſtakes, yet he ſhould
not value his Threats of further Expoſing him,
and his Writings.</p>
