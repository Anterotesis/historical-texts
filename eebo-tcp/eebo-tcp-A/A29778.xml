            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <speaker>Harry.</speaker>
               <p>OH Sir, I am glad to see you: what <hi>Anno aetatis suae</hi> 72. and yet so brave and lusty? having not of late seen any thing from you, I was afraid that the difficulty of finding out <hi>Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murderer,</hi> had tempted you to make upon your self some fatal experiment; like the <hi>Philosopher,</hi> when he could not solve the motion of the <hi>Sea,</hi> threw himself into it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>I must confess, <hi>Harry,</hi> I have been of late (but much against my inclinations) very useless; my talent and the present current of Affairs are diametrically opposite: had the Church of <hi>England</hi> men been our own, I could have run divisions upon the Dissenters <hi>ad infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;</hi> I would have proved them a pack of Rebels for a whole Century; I would have made the last 88 to be of a plece with this; and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Armada should have been believed to be no more than a Phanatick Conspiracy.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Har.</speaker>
               <p>Nay the Dissenters are not at this time to be provoked.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rog.</speaker>
               <p>That I am very sensible of, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have endeavoured all I could to bring my self to speak for them; but I find I do it so auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, that you would as soon cure the Rickets in one of my age, as bring any thing of mine into shape that pleads for them: my Answer to the <hi>Letter to a Dissenter,</hi> I hope, was an ample spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen of my good will; bút my wit lay so much the other way, that my answer was looked upon to be the worst of the four and twenty; besides
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100486:2"/>
my printing of the Letter at large, made me in danger to be brought in as a disperser of the Libel.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Har.</speaker>
               <p>I must tell you, <hi>Sir Roger,</hi> that Answer with some other late Writings of yours, has a little atton'd for your old Sins; and tho the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters do not look upon you as their best friend; yet it has in some measure allayed the enmity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the Serpent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rog.</speaker>
               <p>Now you put me in mind. I think I have given the Dissenters in some of my last Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servators a very pleasing farewel: If I be not mistaken, I spoke notable things for the Tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and were it not for the reproach of <hi>self-contradiction,</hi> I could have said twenty times as much.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Har.</speaker>
               <p>What need you fear <hi>self-contradiction</hi> so much? Cannot you say, That <hi>upon a change of circumstances, a man may likewise vary his judgment as to Toleration, with a respect to</hi> hic &amp; nunc; <hi>[R. L</hi>'s. Answer to the Letter to a Dissenter, p. 12.] and what was abominable in one Reign, may be Law and Gospel in another?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rog.</speaker>
               <p>You speak right; to alter one's opinion, tho at threescore and twelve, I think, is no very great blemish: But I that have so often chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leng'd the World to discover <hi>two clashing Senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> in all my Writings; that have carried my matters always so even, that to discover <hi>one flaw</hi> in me, was as difficult as to find out Sir <hi>Edmund-Bury-Godfrey</hi>'s Murther: For me to speak home for Toleration, would make it a harder task, to find an agreement between my Works, than it would be to reconcile the two Churches.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Har.</speaker>
               <p>What is't you have so unluckily said, that will make it so heinous in you to write for Toleration?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rog.</speaker>
               <p>O I have spoke against the Dissenters such hard words, that now I could willingly eat them; but withal they are so full of Gall and bitterness, that should I swallow them, they were in danger to come up again.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Har.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis but gilding them then, Sir <hi>Roger;</hi> a sew, Presents from the Dissenting Party, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, will make 'em run down easily: But what are these cutting Expressions?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rog.</speaker>
               <p>Why among other things, I have said, That <hi>Liberty of Conscience was a Paradox against Law, Reason, Nature and Religion:</hi> [Obs. Vol. 3. Numb. 4<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.] and should I now unsay all this, the Wags would make such work with me, as I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly did with <hi>Richard</hi> and <hi>Baxter.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Har.</speaker>
               <p>Have you never an old <hi>Distinction</hi> then left to help you out at a dead lift? I remember when I had occasion to consult your writings, <hi>distinguishing</hi> was the best part of your talent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rog.</speaker>
               <p>That you must know I have already at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, when I perceived that an <hi>Indulgence</hi> was a brewing; I thought it was high time for me to draw back, and pull in my horns; and therefore I immediately fell to work; and split the hair. I artificially divided an Indulgence, <hi>into an Indulgence granted and an Indulgence taken; into an Indulgence that shall owe it self to the favour of the Prince, and an Indulgence that shall be got by the importunities of the People:</hi> [Observ. Vol. 3. Numb. 43.] By thus nicely distinguishing the matter, I was in hopes to rescue the present To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration from the stroaks of my former animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions; and in my Answer to the Letter to a Dissenter, my telling the Dissenters that <hi>The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of Indulgence ran to them, and not they to the Declaration,</hi> [Answ. to the Letter, p. 3.] I think was a full Comment upon the Text as it stands thus divided.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Har.</speaker>
               <p>Methinks, Sir <hi>Roger,</hi> this Distinction is very ridiculous, and I can compare it to nothing more, than to a Decree of the Council of <hi>Constance,</hi> which, I remember ever since I writ my Pacquet, runs thus: Upon the Debate about the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in one kind, it was ordered, that when the Laity <hi>desired</hi> the Cup, it was by all means to be <hi>denied</hi> them; but if they would submit to the <hi>non obstante</hi> to our Saviour's Institution, and <hi>not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire</hi> it; then they might be <hi>allowed</hi> to partake of it: So that, <hi>Ask and ye shall receive,</hi> it seems is a Rule that will by no means hold in the case of Toleration.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rog.</speaker>
               <p>I must confess I was there hard put to it, and you may be sure, that 'twas not willingly that I took my leave so abruptly of the Observator, and went trailing, like a Blood hound, after the Murder of Sir <hi>E. B. G.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Har.</speaker>
               <p>Let Murder alone, when all comes to all, 'tis but saying that he was a Heretick, and then Killing you know is no Murder. Our busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness must now be to get off the <hi>Penal Laws.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rog.</speaker>
               <p>Penal Laws! Had my endeavours suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, they should have been kept up to the end of the Chapter, ay and as tight too as any Fiddle-string: cou'd I but have brought over the Church of <hi>England</hi> men, our business had been done; and I think I drew as good a Scheme for accommodation, as ever <hi>Cassander</hi> did, or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100486:2"/>
the Bishop of <hi>Spalato:</hi> Had that project took, the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> wou'd have been as useful to us as the <hi>Inquisition;</hi> and then I had boldly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, That <hi>neither the Church of</hi> England, <hi>nor the Members of the Church of</hi> Rome, <hi>cou'd be joyn'd in a Toleration with the Phanaticks, but with the certain ruin of both.</hi> [Obs. Vol. 3. Num. 134.]</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Har.</speaker>
               <p>These Church of <hi>England</hi> men are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obstinate.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rog.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, and perverse too; insomuch that you would as soon perswade the Pope to part with the Franchises, as bring them to pray to the People in an unknown tongue. T'other day a Friend of ours (I suppose after reading my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Accommodation) asked a Church-man; in case the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> should give up <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiation,</hi> what would the Church of <hi>England</hi> part with in order to a reconciliation: And what dost think the Church-man offered in exchange?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Har.</speaker>
               <p>Why, the nine and thirty Articles, I suppose.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rog.</speaker>
               <p>I protest only <hi>Passive Obedience;</hi> and I wou'd no more take that Principle from them; than I wou'd unshackle a Mad-man. Passive valor is a virtue I love in an Enemy; and 'tis as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa y for our preservation that they hold this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, as 'tis for the Grand Seignior that a Bassa believes that of <hi>Fatality,</hi> when he is to undergo the disclpline of the Bow-string.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Har.</speaker>
               <p>I give the Church of <hi>England</hi> men for lost; and therefore for my part, my Province shall be to gain the Dissenters, I think the wind blows fairest from that side.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Rog.</speaker>
               <p>Prithee, <hi>Harry,</hi> how cam'st thee to be either beloved by the <hi>Papists,</hi> or believed by the <hi>Dissenters?</hi> I am sure you have spoke as severe things of the <hi>Papists,</hi> as ever I did of the <hi>Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> and yet by a sudden turn you are become as gracious, as if you were a Convert of some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable standing.</p>

               <p>Sir, you are heartily welcome, I am never so engaged, but that I am always ready to wait upon a Person of your Character.

               <p>That is not at present my business. You must know, there is a <hi>small place</hi> in his Majesties service lately fall'n vacant, which lies so conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently in my neighbourhood, that as it may not be of such advantage to another, so no one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps can so easily attend the duty with so much diligence as my self; and therefore since I am told, that now all Offices are disposed of <hi>without distinction;</hi> I hope by virtue of former acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I may beg your interest on my behalf.</p>

               <p>Before I can appear your Friend, you must answer me first to some few <hi>Questions;</hi> for no man must expect his Reward, before he can say his Catechism. <hi>Will you, whenever there is a Parliament call'd, endeavour to choose such men as will take off the Tests and Penal Laws?</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Har.</speaker>
               <p>You must know then, that no one Is to be either promoted to, or continued in an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,

               <p>Why this is encountring <hi>Test</hi> with <hi>Test,</hi> setting one nail to drive out another; if a man be not qualified for an Office but upon such <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions:</hi> You seem to set up as hard things as those you would have abrogated. For what is the difference between your obliging a man to abjure the <hi>Test,</hi> and the Laws requiring him to renounce <hi>Transubstantiation?</hi> but only this, that for my part I think renouncing <hi>Transubstantiation</hi> to be the more <hi>innocent.</hi>

               <p>There is a greater difference than you may imagin: for the Declaration that is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the Law is a <hi>violence</hi> to a Man's <hi>conscience;</hi> 'tis obliging him to renounce an Article of his Faith; whereas the Tests are matters purely po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical: they were <hi>promoted by a Faction,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed only to gratifie <hi>a Party, which is pleased to call it self</hi> the Church of England.</p>

               <p>Hold there, <hi>Harry,</hi> these words are something too severe; let me tell you, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make the <hi>enacting</hi> of these <hi>Laws</hi> to be the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of a <hi>Faction,</hi> without putting the late <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Parliament</hi> at the very head on't; and it does not become you to speak so <hi>irreverently</hi> of a <hi>Crowned Head,</hi> thô it lies in ashes. But suppose a man shou'd believe in his conscience, that the Tests are a great security to the <hi>Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and that the consequence of repealing them will be the introducing of <hi>Popery;</hi> (as I must necessarily think of those many Noble and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Gentlemen, who lately lost their Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon this very question) is not the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of such a one out of his Office, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps is his whole subsistence, for not consenting to repeal these <hi>Tests,</hi> not only a <hi>privative,</hi> but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your wise distinction, <hi>a positive inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of penalties on the score of conscience?</hi> [Occur.

               <p>Pray, <hi>Harry,</hi> how long have you had such a favourable opinion of their good nature? what, <hi>are all the holy Candles out, that you formerly told us, were made of Protestant Grease at the Irish Massacre?</hi> [Pacq. <hi>Nov.</hi> 19. 1680.] Are there no Popish Fires but that which burnt the City? Or have the <hi>French Protestants</hi> think you, left their Estates and come over only for the advantage of a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection? These are too bitter things, <hi>Harry,</hi> to be so easily digested: and if I be not much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken, I can shew you that some of them are bound by <hi>Oaths</hi> to give <hi>Hereticks no better quarter.</hi>

               <p>No I'll assure you; I had it from the worthy Author of the <hi>Pacquet of Advice from Rome;</hi> and certainly he must needs know best what was done there, where he kept his weekly correspondence.

               <p>I do assure you, it has been the <hi>constant</hi> judgment of <hi>Papists,</hi> that men all ought to have <hi>Liberty of Conscience:</hi> and they are very ill men, and you ought not to joyn with them who wou'd perswade you to the contrary.</p>

               <p>Hold, not too fast there, you will ruine the <hi>Dispensing power</hi> else; for if the King may not <hi>suspend that Act too</hi> at pleasure, what will become of those Officers, who have made so bold with the Laws in being? for the consequence must reach all Acts alike.</p>

               <p>Ay, but these <hi>Tests</hi> are in their <hi>nature</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, and dangerous to the government in their <hi>consequence;</hi> and so no matter what becomes of them.</p>

               <p>And will not <hi>that Law,</hi> think you, be <hi>unjust,</hi> which cramps the King's <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> right of <hi>suspending</hi> Acts of Parliament? so that <hi>this Law</hi> or the mighty Prerogative of <hi>suspending</hi> immediatly falls to the ground: and which do you think will most likely get the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on't? Besides that Law, if it be <hi>equipollent,</hi> must exclude all <hi>Romish Priests</hi> from Officiating in any publick Church or Chappel within the Kingdom: Now if it be, according to you, so <hi>impious</hi> to exclude Papists from serving the <hi>King</hi> in <hi>publick Offices;</hi> what a <hi>monstrous</hi> piece of <hi>impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> will Popish Judges interpret that Law to be,

which excludes the Priests from serving <hi>God</hi> in his <hi>publick Worship?</hi> and therefore the apparent consequence of repealing our Laws to me will be this; that hereafter we shall have all Popish Governours both in Church and State; and to us will be left the Merit of <hi>obedience,</hi> and the Glory of <hi>suffering;</hi> onely I am afraid we shall much Eclipse that Glory, upon some melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly considerations that we have had a hand in our <hi>own execution.</hi>
