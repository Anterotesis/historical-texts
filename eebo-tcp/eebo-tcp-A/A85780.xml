            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen a Kingdom or People ſtand in need of Reformation, (as none ever were in more need then we) it is undoubtedly a good way to obſerve the ſame Method that God himſelf did, in his proceeding to judgement againſt the houſe of <hi>Judah,</hi> Ezek. <hi>9.6,</hi> beginning at his Sanctuary: The things that are amiſs there, let them be rectified and amended, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving it in the firſt place, and then (like lines ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended from the Centre to the Circumference) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation will the more happily diffuſe it ſelf into other places: For, the Sanctuary being the fountain whence help and divine protection iſſue, <hi>Pſal. 20.2.</hi> the treaſury, where all bleſsings are to be obtained by the people of God, when they make their holy, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb facs="tcp:118231:3"/>and devout addreſſes to him; cleanſe That, and the things there, and then the Streams will flow more fairly into ſuch places as want water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>For this purpoſe, here is a Beſom to ſweep away an horrid abuſe, wherewith the adverſary to God and Man, Religion and Decency, hath much and long corrupted our Publike Aſſemblies before God in his Sanctuary; and that is, Profaneſs and Irreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence toward the ſacred Majeſtie of God, before whom the appearance is, which is after ſo rude a manner, as if God were equal, nay inferiour to the meaneſt of us.</p>
            <p>Though contrarily, the expulſion of Corporal ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and reverence out of our Publike Aſſemblies, be now accounted an act of Reformation, 't is no wonder, when in all corrupt Ages and Places, <hi>Evil</hi> hath been called <hi>Good,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Iſai. 5.20.</note> and <hi>Good Evil:</hi> Vices have been called Vertues, and ſo embraced; and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues Vices, and ſo deteſted: Piety having been brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Nick-names, and Irreligion aſſuming ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous appellations: That hath gotten Spittle from the mouth; This, kiſſes from the lips.</p>
            <p>Now for this poor Treatiſe creeping forth into publike view, if it may, to reform what is amiſs,
<pb facs="tcp:118231:3"/>and to advance the honour of God in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. I am not ignorant, how that in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects it may receive ſuch a Terrifying Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did from <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Exod. <hi>10.10, Look to it, for evil is before you.</hi> Some, becauſe they ſee not the name of ſome learned Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy (which commonly is a great advantage to a Book) prefixed, may ſay in ſcorn, <note place="margin">Ecclus 13.22.</note> with thoſe in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racides, What fellow's this?</hi> Some again, apprehending by the Title-page the general Subject, or galloping the Treatiſe it ſelf over, with an haſty eye, may ſay, as the <hi>Iews</hi> did againſt <hi>S. Paul;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts 18.13.</note> 
               <hi>This fellow perſwadeth men to worſhip God contrary to the Law.</hi> A Third ſort may accuſe the Work of Unſeaſonableneſs, That it came not forth into the world (like the <hi>Shunemite</hi>-woman into the Kings preſence) juſt when the thing was in the words, <note place="margin">2 Kings 8.5.</note> when the buſineſs was in agitation, but long after the Queſtion is ceaſed; and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inclination hath ſince been to the Negative. But, (as the Apoſtle ſaid in another caſe) <hi>None of theſe things move me:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Acts 20.24.</note> Let theſe, and greater Evils then theſe, ariſe againſt this poor Treatiſe, I paſs not, ſo I have Truth and Religion on my ſide: for which, upon my beſt (though I confeſs but weak)
<pb facs="tcp:118231:4"/>examination) 1 finde nothing, why I ſhould decline any ludge whatſoever, whether it be God himſelf, whoſe Cauſe this is, and whoſe Minde, in this caſe, is to be ſeen in his written Word; or any inferiour under him, either Ancient or Modern, Chriſtian or Heathen, the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> onely excepted, and (amongſt Chriſtians) him, who hath ſo firmly betrothed himſelf to a Prejudicate Opinion, that he will not be divorced from it.</p>
            <p>And for thee, <hi>Reader,</hi> whoever thou art; If knowing, and haſt concerning this Subject greater il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminations in thine Heart, then theſe in thine Hand, impart them; if not, accept of theſe. If ignorant, (thy thoughts having not as yet been converſant in theſe things) Do not think that I have any deſigne to abuſe or deceive thee, as if I would convey a mote into thine eye, by preſenting this Treatiſe to the view of it: No; God is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, my aim is, to elevate thy Devotion to that juſt height, as that thou mayſt fully and compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acknowledge God, by worſhipping him with thy Soul and Body; not ſuperſtitiouſly, hypocritically, affectedly, or any other irregular way; but hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and ſincerely, according to thy duty in thy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
<pb facs="tcp:118231:4"/>before him, when his own eye, and the eyes of his holy Angels are upon thee, obſerving thy behaviour in thoſe approaches; which if it be not anſwerable to his Divine preſence, thou canſt have no cauſe to think, but that God will diſlike thee, as <hi>Achiſh</hi> did <hi>David,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 21.</note> when he counterfeited Madneſs before him, letting the ſpittle fall upon his beard:</p>
            <p>Take heed then, leſt thou go out of Gods preſence guilty of <hi>Iacob</hi>'s over-ſight; <hi>Surely the Lord is in this place, and I was not aware:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gen.28.16.</note> and ſo, though thy coming in might be in hope of a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, yet thou goeſt away without it, having by thy profane rudeneſs provoked God ſo, as neither to accept thy Perſon, nor thy Prayer, nor any Duty which thou haſt performed, but, <note place="margin">Luke 1.53.</note> with the <hi>rich</hi> in the Goſpel, to ſend thee <hi>empty away:</hi> And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, more then ſo, haſt provoked him to wrath, that he ſhould execute poſitively ſome vengeance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, making a <hi>breach</hi> upon thee, as upon <hi>Uz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zah,,</hi> for that thou haſt <hi>not ſought him after the due order,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Chro.15.13"</note> in ſuch an humble and reverent way, as befitteth ſo great and glorious a Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty. If thou have a deſire to prevent theſe things, and to excite Gods henevolence towards
<pb facs="tcp:118231:5"/>thee, beware of rude irruptions into, and diſſolute continuance in Gods preſence.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay no more, but (commending thee to the race of God, and this poor Treatiſe to thy diſcreet Peruſal) bid thee</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T appears by the example of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> that it is not ſafe for a man to hold his peace, when there is occaſion to vindi cate Gods honour lying at ſtake, or called in queſtion: for we read in the Twentieth Chapter of the book of <hi>Numbers,</hi> how that the Iſraelites came to the wilderneſs of <hi>Zin,</hi> and murmured there, becauſe there was no water, and becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> did not believe the Lord, to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:118231:6"/>him in the eyes of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> by declaring his Power and Providence, that God both could and would provide things neceſſary for them; for this Omiſſion God was ſo angry with them, that he would not ſuffer them to enter into the promiſed Land, as appears plainly at the twelfth Verſe of the ſame Chapter: And at the eight and twentieth Verſe is recorded, how that this ſentence was executed upon <hi>Aaron;</hi> for God ſent him up into mount <hi>Hor,</hi> and there he died. And in the twenty ſeventh Chapter of the ſame book of <hi>Numbers,</hi> verſ. 12, 13, 14, and likewiſe <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 49, 50, 51. mention is made of the death of <hi>Moſes</hi> in mount <hi>Nebo,</hi> for the ſame fault of not ſanctifying the Lord in the midſt of the children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We cannot conceive of this, otherwiſe, then that it was ſet for a preſident, and an exemplary <hi>Caveat</hi> to the Magiſtracie and Prieſthood in all ſucceeding Generations to the worlds end, that they be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to vindicate and maintain Gods honour, with his Divine priviledges and prerogatives, in the ſight of the people, leſt God ſtop the paſſage againſt them, and deny them entrance into the heavenly <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The conſideration of which, is neceſſary for theſe days of ours, wherein there is great murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Corporal Reverence and Worſhip ſhould be given unto God; and it is not onely neglected and oppoſed, but branded with ignominy, ſlander, and reproach; which, whether they be juſt, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious, I ſhall (God willing) according to my abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, endeavour to make appear, in this enſuing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118231:6"/>Diſcourſe upon a portion of Scripture which allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to that Subject: <hi>Adorabis Dominum Deum tuum: Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot be objected, with any ſhew of reaſon, that the Spiritual Worſhip of God (I mean that of the Soul onely) ſhould be here preciſely under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood: the occaſion will lead us to the ſenſe, which may be deduced from the Verſe going before, where we ſee what a large proffer the devil made unto our Saviour, that he would give him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them, if he would fall down, and worſhip him: And ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it was Corporal worſhip that the devil would have had. <note place="margin">Vol.2.pag.84.</note> The devil (ſaith Mr <hi>Perkins</hi>) deſired of Chriſt no more then the proſtrating of his body: <note place="margin">col. 2.C.</note> and the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, in the devils propoſition, which is for falling down, plainly demonſtrates as much, being taken in the common courſe of Scripture for no other then a Bodily act. Beſides, if our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours reply to the devils temptation ſhould not be taken in the ſame ſenſe of Corporal adoration, as the devil propounded it, then did not our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour give a pertinent and ſatisfactory anſwer to the devils motion; which were vile to think. The devil was a ſubtil Sophiſter; and if he ſhould have ſeen our Savior to lie open in that ward, as to intend Spiritual worſhip, when h ſpake of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, he would ſoon have replied, Worſhip the Lord thy God with thy ſpirit, according to thine own meaning; and worſhip me with thy body, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my meaning. Therefore it cannot be, but that our Saviour conſuted the devil in his own
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118231:7"/>ſenſe of Bodily worſhip by laying the Law before him, whereby he ſhewed him, how that all men (and himſelf amongſt the reſt) were bound to give their Worſhip unto God, and not to alienate it from him, as the devil would have had him done.</p>
            <p>It was the moſt preſumptuous motion that ever the devil made, to have had Chriſt worſhip him. Never was ſuch a thing heard of before, that the foul fiend, <note place="margin">Heb. 1.6.</note> the curſed angel, ſhould ſeek to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped of Him, whom all the bleſſed Angels wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and adore. How durſt he attempt to rob God of his Royal priviledge of Corporal adoration, and require it even from the Son of God? But we ſee the devils pride, and what his aim is, To exalt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into Gods Chair of State, and (if he can) to deprive him of his incommunicable prerogatives. Nothing will ſerve his turn, but the things that pertain to God: to deſpoil God of theſe, is his deſire and glory.</p>
            <p>And this may give us occaſion to apprehend a fair probability, that Religious Bodily worſhip is Gods propriety and due, that the devil was ſo eager upon it, and for this, bethought himſelf to aſſail our Saviour with the ſtrongeſt temptation that poſſibly he could; to wit, the Wealth, Honour, and Glory of this world; thinking, that if any thing would prevail, it muſt be that. Becauſe with this bait he had taken many great ones in preceding Ages of the world, he thought he might, at this time, take our Saviour alſo. But the great Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver found himſelf greatly deceived: And as he was deceived in himſelf, ſo I wiſh he may no longer
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118231:7"/>deceive thoſe that oppoſe themſelves againſt Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſhip, denying that it ſhould be given to God: For, to this the devils policy works, that, if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get Corporal adoration to himſelf, amongſt Chriſtians (as he hath of ſome poor Heatheniſh people in ſome places of the world) then he will do what he can to hinder God, that he ſhall not have it neither; <hi>Nec mei, nec Dei,</hi> cries the devil then; Let it be neither mine, nor Gods: Put we have a contrary voice in this Scripture; <hi>Adorabis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſee then in what ſenſe theſe words are to be underſtood; of Outward, not onely Inward; of Corporal, not onely Spiritual adoration. Here (ſaith Mr <hi>Perkins</hi>) we muſt underſtand our Saviour Chriſt, <note place="margin">Vol.3. p.403.</note> to mean Outward Divine Worſhip; <note place="margin">Col. 2.</note> as if he ſhould ſay, Thou ſhalt religiouſly ſubmit, bow, or proſtrate thy body unto God, in Prayer and Thankſgiving. And the word which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our uſeth here, (and is alſo commonly uſed in other places ſerving to this purpoſe) may import as much. <gap reason="foreign">

Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed we now to the examination of this buſineſs, obſerving this Order: 1. To examine what is commonly objected againſt it, on the negative part.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118231:8"/>2. What evidence or authority may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, to defend or require it, on the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative part; that, if it ſhall appear Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral adoration to be Gods due, the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers and detainers of it may be left without excuſe, for not giving uno God the things that are Gods.</p>
            <p>But I deſire (by the way) to be rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and to avoid the miſpriſion of the Reader: for I would not, that this treating of Outward worſhip ſhould be any prejudice, or occaſion the leaſt damage to the Inward, (as if a man ſhould offer unto God the huſk of an outward Ceremony, without the concomitancy of the hearts inward affection.) God forbid, that I ſhould think, or be thought to excuſe any ſuch hypocriſie. But this is the thing, Whether, in worſhipping God with the heart and ſoul, it be lawful, decent, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, to joyn the Body with it, and ſo to exerciſe and employ the whole man, both ſoul and body together in the Worſhip of God. It is granted on both ſides, that God is to be worſhipped with the Soul: but whether he is to be worſhipped with the body alſo, this is the thing in queſtion.</p>

But, when Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worſhip is given to God, who himſelf is the true and onely Deity, Is this Idolatry? Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is, when Religious Worſhip is taken from the Creator, and given to the Creature: But, when it is given to the Creator, as his right and due, Is this Idolatry? Why was not Corporal Worſhip ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Idolatry, before, and under the Law, as well as now? That which is I dolatry in theſe days, was ſo, from the beginning of the world, by a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal principle. But we are ſure, that Corporal Worſhip unto God was not accounted Idolatry, neither before, or under the Law, when <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob, David,</hi> and many other devout perſons practiſed it; therefore it cannot be Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try now. Or, who dare ſay, that our Saviour ſtopped the devils mouth with ſin, or, gave liberty unto men to be Idolaters, when he alleadged this place of Scripture againſt the devil?</p>
            <p>Yet, for further anſwer, I would they knew and conſidered, what fear there is of their running themſelves againſt a very dangerous rock, who make this Objection; the ſin of Blaſphemy, and that in a very high degree, in regard, whoſoever ſhall ſay, that Bodily Worſhip unto God is Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, will ſeem in effect to ſay, that God himſelf is an Idol.

            <p>This word <hi>Superſtition</hi> is that great Scar-crow in Religion, ſo common in moſt mens mouthes, that what religious action ſoever does not reliſh upon their palate, they cry out againſt it, Superſtition, Superſtition; whereby they think to render it ſo odious, as that it ſhould be abhorred. To whom (as concerning this duty of Corporal adoration to God) I will not ſtick to apply that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Theſe ſpeak evil of thoſe things which they underſtand not:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jude verſ. 10.</note> For, as another Apoſtle ſpeaks in another caſe, <hi>Had they known it,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.8.</note> , <hi>they would not have crucified the Lord of glory:</hi> Even ſo, did theſe know what Reverend adoring God with the Body is, they would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute it with ſuch opprobrious and ſcandalous terms.</p>
            <p>But let's examine the Objection: Is Corporal adoration of God, Superſtition? That's neither true, nor ſafe to ſay: For, conſider Superſtition in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118231:9"/>the abſtract, and it will appear that Corporal wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is no more Superſtition, then Truth is Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. But perhaps their meaning is, that Bodily worſhip is ſuperſtitiouſly performed: men are grown ſuperſtitious in the doing of it: And Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſhip being grown to this paſs, it is to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and taken away, as unlawful, and not to be practiſed any longer.</p>
            <p>I anſwer again, That, in caſe Bodily worſhip be performed after a ſuperſtitious manner; yet this is but a weak Argument to conclude the abolition of the thing it ſelf. For our proceeding then in this buſineſs, I ſee no reaſon but it ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated like thoſe in our other buſineſſes. If a man be ſick, Muſt he therefore be knock'd o'th' head, rather then be recovered with Phyſick? If he hath a ſore on his thigh, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had, <note place="margin">2 King. 20.7.</note> Will he rather do by his very Fleſh, <note place="margin">2 Sam. 10.4.</note> as <hi>Hanun</hi> did by the Garments of <hi>Davids</hi> meſſengers, cut it away by the buttocks, then apply a bunch of figs, or ſome other plaiſter, to heal it? If he hath a Tree in his Garden taken with a Worm, will he rather dig up the Tree by the root, then ſeek to kill the Worm? If a Thief come into a True-man's company, muſt the True<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſuffer with the Thief? Why then cannot the Superſtition (with which Gods Bodily worſhip is infected and depraved) be purged, and taken away, without quite taking away the thing it ſelf? If it were good to conclude the utter aboliſhing of a thing, from the abuſe of it, the whole Frame of Religion would quickly be diſſolved, and nothing left: For, what have we in Religion, which by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118231:10"/>ſome or other is not abuſed? Gods Houſe, his Day, his Word, are abuſed; and if they ſhould not therefore be uſed, we ſhould have neither Place, nor Time, nor Rule for his Service. The duties of Praying, Preaching, and Adminiſtring the Sacraments, are abuſed; and God forbid but they ſhould ſtill be uſed, for all that. If any reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious act ſhould be deſerted becauſe it is abuſed by others, then, a Papiſt, a Jew, a Turk, in caſe he could not diſſwade us from our Religion, neither by fair means, nor foul; it were a ready way, to embrace the ſame Religion with us, for a time, and to ſtuff it with groſs abuſes, and ſo drive us from our Religion that way.</p>
            <p>A great care would be had, leſt we run from one Extreme to another, <note place="margin">Hor.</note> as Fools do; <hi>Dum vitant ſtulti vitia,</hi> &amp;c. Whilſt they ſhun one vice, they run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other contrary; and ſo are as far from the golden Mean, as they were before. If whilſt we flee from Superſtition, we ſuffer our ſelves to ſlide into an irreverent Profaneneſs in Gods preſence, the Remedy is as bad as (if not worſe then) the Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Not to ſtand now to vindicate thoſe, who out of a pious ſincerity worſhip God with their bodies, from this ſlander of Superſtition, (which were a worthy taſk:) If (concurring with the cenſorious humour of the Objectors) it be ſuppoſed that ſome men, in worſhipping God with their bodies, are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, (of which whoſoever be guilty, I could wiſh they would amend it;) What if they who refuſe to worſhip God with their Bodies, be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118231:10"/>alſo, even in refuſing? For ought I know, they may be ſo: For, though they refuſe out of a fear to diſpleaſe God, yet, if that fear be cauſleſs, needleſs, and ſuperfluous, it may (not unfitly) be termed Superſtitious: which name Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> gives it <note n="*" place="margin">

               </note> Nature it ſelf having imprinted in the hearts of men a ſecret cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of bodily reverence to be given unto God: As may appear by many examples: that of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> falling on his face, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.3. that of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant bowing down his head, and worſhipping the Lord for his good ſucceſs in his journey, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.26. and that which was done by the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they heard the tidings of their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from their heavie bondage in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Exod. 12.27. with many other of this kinde. So that Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily worſhip was in uſe and practice, many yeers before any tittle of the Ceremonial Law was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. And as it was long before, ſo likewiſe (as longer lifed) is it continued long after: for where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Ceremonies of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law were wholly
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118231:11"/>aboliſhed by Chriſts death, (the termination of which may ſeem to be implied in his <hi>Conſummatum eſt</hi> upon the Croſs) Corporal adoration is authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed (as ſhall and will appear) by ſufficient precept and practice, <note place="margin">Joh. 19.30.</note> ſince our Saviours Death, Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Aſcenſion. And the reaſon of it is ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enough to the flexible conſiderer, that Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral adoration is included, not in the Ceremonial, but in the Moral Law, in the Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And who knows not, that the Moral Law was not aboliſhed by the death of Chriſt, but is, and ſhall be in force to the end of the world?</p>
            <p>Perhaps ſome <hi>Antiſomatist</hi> may conceive from <hi>Job.</hi> 4.23. (which place will come by and by to be examined) that worſhipping God with the body was ſo aboliſhed, as that, to worſhip him with the heart, ſoul, and ſpirit, ſucceeded in its ſtead. But this cannot be: for worſhipping God with the heart and ſoul, was in the world long before Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſhip was (as is conceived) aboliſhed; and the Inward Worſhip is fully as ancient as the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: For, did not <hi>Abraham, David,</hi> and the reſt of Gods devout ſervants, worſhip God in heart, ſoul and ſpirit, as well as with their bodies? Were they not inwardly touched with an awful reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence towards the great Majeſtie of God, and ſo adored him? Surely yes: elſe we might think they played the hypocrites, in making outward ſhews, and not doing any thing within, relating unto God and his Worſhip. If then Cordial wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was not brought in, Corporal worſhip was not for it done away by the death of Chriſt. Indeed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118231:11"/>our Saviour did bring in a Spiritual worſhip; but what that is, ſhall appear, when I have diſpatched another Objection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Corporal Adoration, or Bodily Worſhip, is offenſive, <note place="margin">4 Objection.</note> and ſcandalous; it gives offence to the weak: Therefore they who practiſe it, ought to forbear it, elſe they offend; which they muſt not as,</hi> Rom. 14.21. &amp; I Cor. 10.32.</p>
            <p>That thing ſhould not offend the weak, <note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> by which others are made ſtrong. And I could appeal to clouds of witneſſes, who, out of an honeſt care to worſhip God devoutly with their bodies, have felt themſelves much ſtrengthened in their ſouls. But, if they who are offended at Corporal adoration be weak indeed, then the parties offending ought to inform and ſatisfie the parties offended; and the parties offended are to ſeek after information and ſatisfaction, by their own ſtudies, or conſultation with others; by which means they may receive ſtrength to remove the offence from their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, and then (without doubt) they will, not onely approve Bodily worſhip in others, but pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe it themſelves. But if, pretending weakneſs, they be obſtinate, ſtubborn, and perverſe, (which humour, our Saviour Chriſt himſelf was not ſo happie, or rather unhappie, as to pleaſe) then Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral adoration ought not to be forborn, in fear to offend ſuch people: but let the practiſers of it go on, <note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>For the right underſtanding of this place of Scripture, we muſt know, that <hi>Spirit</hi> there (for the ſtrength of the Objection lieth in this word) is not to be underſtood of the ſoul, in oppoſition to the body; and ſo Outward bodily worſhip to be done away, and the Inward worſhip of the ſoul to come in ſtead of it: but it is to be underſtood in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Sacrifices and other Ceremonies of the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, where with the Samaritanes did then worſhip God, in that mountain, by themſelves, in a Temple of their own; and the Jews by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in their Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">In loc.</note> 
               <hi>Notanda est antitheſis inter ſpiritum &amp; externas figuras,</hi> ſaith Mr <hi>Calvin:</hi> the oppoſition is to be noted betwixt <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> and the outward ſigures. For we know, that the Worſhip or Service which the Samaritanes and Jews did then generally uſe, conſiſted in External Rites, and Viſible Sacrifices of beaſts, and other Oblations; which manner of Worſhip being ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be aboliſhed, a Spiritual or Evangelical Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhould be introduced into the place of it, wherein no Typical nor Figurative Sacrifices ſhould be offered. And if it be rightly conſidered,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:118231:13"/>it will appear, that thoſe out ward Sacrifices of the Law had little or no affinity with that which our Saviour intends in this Scripture, (<hi>Matth.</hi> 4.10.) and which we call Corporal adoration, or Bodily wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which (in its furtheſt extent) is but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour, then, in that place of S. <hi>John,</hi> doth no way thwart the worſhipping of God with the body.</p>
            <p>I conceive I have enough for it from <hi>Beza,</hi> who, in his Annotation upon the place, is driven to make his defence againſt ſome of the Papiſts, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing him, (in ſome of their Writings, Conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or other ways) that, ſeeking to eſtabliſh the Spiritual worſhip of God, he ſhould deny that God was to be worſhipped with the External worſhip of the body: But of this he clears himſelf; <hi>Imò utrunque Deo ſemper debitum fuiſle, &amp; deberi, abſit, ut inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciemur:</hi> Yes (ſaith he) both the Inward and Outward worſhip have ever been, and ſhall be due unto God: God forbid that we ſhould deny this.</p>
            <p>Yet, if this be not ſufficient, I can raiſe my au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority higher, to the great Apoſtle of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, who, although he ſpeaks in the very words of our Saviour, <hi>Phil. 3. 3. We are the circumciſion, which worſhip God in the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. yet this did not detain him from worſhipping God with his body; as may appear, <hi>Act. 20.36. &amp; 21.5. Eph. 3.14.</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe not the words, becauſe I would have the Reader peruſe, and judge. But would it not ſeem ſtrange, if I ſhould ſay, that Corporal worſhip un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, under the Goſpel, is Spiritual? If I ſhould
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118231:13"/>ſo affirm, there are (and thoſe of no mean credit) that would confirm it.

            <p>I come now to examine what evidence may be produced, to defend and require it, on the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part. In purſuance whereof, I ſhall firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch Arguments, as, from ſolid Grounds, may be drawn to prove it: and afterwards, ſuch Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies from authentick Authors, as may further confirm it.</p>

               </note> Here are three things to be taken notice of, which might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford ſo many ſeveral Arguments; but I ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe them all in one.</p>
            <list>

               <item>1. The Creation,</item>
               <item>2. The Redemption,</item>
               <item>3. The Glorification of theſe our bodies.</item>
            </list>
            <p>There is no Corporeal ſubſtance (what ever it be) that is ſo much ennobled and honoured by the bounty, grace, and mercy of the great Creator, as theſe lumps of Fleſh, <note place="margin">I.</note> our bodies, are: Firſt, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their Creation, though not for Subſtance, yet for Priviledge, above other bodily Creatures; all other Creatures being made for the uſe and ſuſtentation of theſe bodies: Some creatures bring their Fleſh to feed them; ſome, their Wooll and Skins to clothe them: ſome, their Medicinal vertues, to heal them: The Sun affords them light and refreſhment; the Fire warms them; the Water purifies them; the Air affords them a breathing place; the Earth, accommodations for adwelling place: All the Creatures, in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſquadrons, preſent them with their ſerviceable reſpects, from the meaneſt, even to the higheſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Creatures, the holy and bleſſed Angels, who have from God the tutelary charge over theſe our Bodies. And ſhall theſe our Bodies receive theſe benefits, and acknowledge no Homage nor Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip unto God, whoſe goodneſs hath vouchſafed them? Hath God created our Bodies for Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and no way for Himſelf, but left them at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, nay ſecluded them from this ſervice, that they ſhould not <hi>worſhip</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 95.6.</note> , nor <hi>bow,</hi> nor <hi>kneel before the Lord their Maker?</hi> If our Bodies be not bound to this duty and ſervice, What difference then is there betwixt the bodies of Reaſonable men,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:118231:14"/>and the bodies of Bruit beaſts, towards God?</p>
            <p>Secondly, for the bleſſing of Redemption: <note place="margin">2.</note> In this no bodily ſubſtance hath any intereſs, but the bodies of men alone. Chriſt ſprinkled not his blood upon the Sun, nor upon the Moon, nor upon the Stars, nor upon the Heavens, nor upon the Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial creatures; but onely upon the Bodies of Men is the effuſion of that ineſtimable Blood: And ſtill muſt our bodies be ingrateful? Are we not <hi>bought with a price,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cot. 6.20.</note> and muſt we not therefore <hi>glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie God in our bodies, and in our ſpirits,</hi> becauſe they <hi>are Gods?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Look yet further to the Third <note place="margin">3.</note> , the Glorification of our Bodies, which are deſigned to ſuch glory and immortality in the higheſt heavens, as that no Corporeal creature beſides, hath the like happineſs prepared for it. And ſhall our bodies ſtill remain ſtiff, ſtubborn, and inflexible? Let us take heed, leſt this benumming ſtupidity endanger us not, both ſouls and bodies. Let us conſider, that our Souls and Bodies are twins, and that God hath uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them together, as in one man, ſo in one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of his benefits of Creation, Redemption, and Glorification; and from hence, debate and enquire in our ſelves, Whether, or no, there be not cauſe for them to be united, in ſetting forth the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and worſhip of God: for ſeeing God hath not disjoyned them in theſe his Benefits, there can be no colour, that we ſhould disjoyn them in his Worſhip.</p>
            <p>A ſecond Argument may be drawn from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of Idolatry. <note place="margin">2 Argum.</note> , out of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:118231:15"/>
               <hi>Zanchie,</hi> that it is a Religious worſhip, whereby an Idol is worſhipped as the Deity. <hi>A Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</hi>] What's that, but ſuch as Religion bindes to give unto God himſelf? The queſtion then may be aſked, Whether Bodily worſhip given to an Idol, in a religious way, be Idolatry, or no? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 't is plain Idolatry. And what makes it Idolatry, but the giving that Bodily worſhip unto it, which is Religious, and belongs onely to God? Do we not ſee then, in the nature of Idolatry, that Bodily worſhip is Gods due, and therefore he muſt have it, and that, if it were not due unto God, it would thence follow, that, to worſhip an Image with the body were no Idolatry, becauſe the worſhip given unto it belongs not unto God?</p>
            <p>A third Argument may be drawn from the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandment, <note place="margin">3 Argum.</note> which in form of words is a Negative Commandment; and the Rule of the Negative Commandments, is, that they command the contrary to that which they forbid. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: That Commandment which ſays, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adultery,</hi> does, on the contrary, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us to keep our ſelves chaſte and undefiled. That Commandment which ſays, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no murther,</hi> does, on the contrary, command us, that we be careful (as much as in us lies) of preſerving life. That Commandment which ſays, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain</hi> does, on the contrary, command a holy and reverend uſage of Gods Name: <hi>Deut. 6. 13. And ſhalt ſwear by his Name.</hi> In like manner, the Second Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a ſtrict prohibition againſt Idolatry, and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118231:15"/>worſhipping of Images, any Creature, or the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of any thing whatſoever: <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf any graven image, nor the likeneſs of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the water under the earth: thou ſhalt not bow down to them, nor worſhip them,</hi> &amp;c. We ſee here what way Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſhip muſt not go; it muſt not be given to Images, nor to any Creature: Now, doth this Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative precept ſo reſtrain Bodily worſhip, that it ſhould go no way at all, but ſuffer it to be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther omitted? Is there none, or nothing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it? Surely, God himſelf requires and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it, in that prohibition. Thou ſhalt not bow down to <hi>them,</hi> nor worſhip <hi>them,</hi> is as much, as if God had ſaid, Thou ſhalt bow down to <hi>Me,</hi> and worſhip <hi>Me.</hi> If any doubt of this conſtruction of the Negative Commandments, that they command the contrary to what they reſtrain from, inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into the judgement of Divines will ſettle him, that ſo it is, and particularly in this Second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment: For which, I will onely cite the words of that Mirrour of Piety and Learning, Archbiſhop <hi>Uſher,</hi> and leave it to the <note n="*" place="margin">A, <hi>juin.</hi> 22.ae, qu. 122 40. <hi>Zanch.</hi> Tom. 4. col. 363. <hi>Piſicator</hi> in Matth 4 8.</note> margin to point at more. In his <hi>Sum and Subſtance of Chriſtian Religion,</hi> pag. 226. he ſaith thus: <hi>The geſtures of religious adorations being here forbidden to be given unto Images, are therein com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be given unto the God of heaven.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But perhaps ſome will ſay, Theſe are Humane conſtructions, the gloſſes of men: If they could ſee it thus in the written Word of God, <note n="*" place="margin">

               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:118231:16"/>
               <hi>Ye ſhall not fear other gods, nor bow your ſelves to them, nor ſacrifice to them: But the Lord, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt, with great power, and a ſtretched out arm, him ſhall ye fear, and him ſhall ye worſhip, and to him ſhall ye do ſacrifice.</hi> The Negative is in the 35 verſe; and the Affirmative anſwering to it, (as face to face) in the 36. And this ſenſe of the Second Commandment may further appear, by the words following: <hi>For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God.</hi> What is God jealous of, but of his Glory, of his Honour, of his Worſhip, as well Corporal as Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual? He will not have them taken from him, and given to another. As he will not have them given to Another, ſo he will not have them taken from Himſelf. The aſſertion then, that Bodily worſhip to God is Idolatry, unlawful, &amp; unneceſſary, muſt be brought to this Second Commandment, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Touch-ſtone by which it is to be tried. Bring it hither, and let it be judged, whether Bodily wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip unto God be not rather confirmed, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; commanded, then forbidden; and ſo the denial of it to be a ſin againſt this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

               <note place="margin">4 <hi>Argum.</hi>
               </note> A fourth Argument may be drawn from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil worſhip. A Father will look for due honour from his Childe. <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Dod</hi> and <hi>Clevor</hi> on the 5 Com.</note> And for the childes part, bowing is a duty which he is bound to render to his parents by vertue of the Fifth Commandment. A Maſter will expect due obeiſance from his Servant; and that as well Outward, as Inward. Superiours alſo accept the ſame, and Inferiours diſcharge it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction. Why then ſhould not God, our
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118231:16"/>heavenly Father and Lord receive from us religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Bodily worſhip, in honour and obeyſance, as a good Father, and as a great Lord; and beſides, when we profeſs our ſelves his Children and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and alſo acknowledge him, not onely our Superiour, but Supreme of all? Why ſhould not religious worſhip to God extend it ſelf to as large and as ample an act, as the Civil worſhip unto men? No man dares deny God to be the greater object, and infinitely more deſerving then any mortal man can be. If we honour earthly Kings ſo much with our bodies; if we bow, and kneel, when come into the places of great and honourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, Why ſhould we not do the ſame, (and more, if it were poſſible) unto God? Certainly, we Chriſtians may bluſh, and be aſhamed, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Turks ſhould go beyond us in prizing this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for hence they conclude, (and with more reaſon then we can gainſay) that, if they give ſuch worſhip and reverence to their great men, much more ought they to do it unto God.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:118231:17"/>apply them to Bodily worſhip in particular (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as true of this, as of any other ſervice) and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain them thus: If any man think any Outward worſhip is to be exhibited to his Friend, Father, or Neighbour, I account it to be exhibited unto God, and Him to be preferred before All. Whoever ſhall deny God this Service of bodily worſhip, be they Fathers, Maſters, Kings, or Great men; I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with what face they can expect it from their Children, Servants, and Vaſlals. And ſhould I go about, on the one ſide, to abſolve Inferiours from any dutiful obeyſance toward their Superiours, be they Maſters, Fathers, Lords, or Kings; and on the other ſide, charge Superiours, not to expect nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſuch obſervance from their Inferiours; What a bold, abſurd tranſgreſſor againſt the general way of Courtſhip, Civility, and Good Manners, ſhould I be accounted? Yet notwithſtanding, in ſo doing, I ſhould do no more then what is right and juſt, upon this conſequence ſo highly rational, that, if Religious Corporal worſhip may not be given to God, no Civil worſhip may be given to Men; but if That be, then much more ought This to be aboliſhed: which nevertheleſs will not ſerve our turn, nor be any pleaſing ſatisfaction to God, who ought to have his due, whatever Men have.</p>
            <p>This diſtinction of Corporal adoration into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and Civil, with their ſeveral proprieties, the one belonging to God, the other to Man, was handſomely canvaſed betwixt two Heathen Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, <note place="margin">

            <p>See here the devotion of an Heathen, to uphold the reputation of his gods: He would not have men exalted to an equal worſhip with the gods, nor the gods debaſed to an equal worſhip with men, no not with <hi>Alexander,</hi> as great a King as he was. Surely then, he abhorred to think, that the gods ſhould be made lower then men, in having
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118231:18"/>no worſhip, no adoration at all exhibited unto them, which (in a Civil way) men have. Tell me, Chriſtian, Did an Heathen, who ſaw leſs of the true God then thou, ſee more in Religion then thou?</p>
            <p>But, as the Levite would rather paſs on to <hi>Gl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beah,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Judg. 9.12.</note> that was of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> then turn aſide to <hi>Jebus</hi> the city of a ſtranger; ſo had I ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to confirm Gods propriety in Religious Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral adoration by the Civil, conſult with a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſtian, then an Heathen. Let me therefore ſharpen the point of this Argument (if it be not ſharp enough already) with the teſtimony of a late learned Divine, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ludvicus Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellus</hi> in Spici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legio, ad 1 Cor. 11. 4. mihi pag 87.</note> who was Profeſſor of the Hebrew Tongue in the Univerſity of <hi>Salmure.</hi> He, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing largely of the External practices of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Nations in the duty of Prayer, upon occaſion of the Apoſtles words, 1 <hi>Cor.11.4.</hi> concludes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious demeanour towards God to be conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Civil practices of Nations towards Men. The Turks (ſaith he) pray with their heads cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe they uncover not their heads to one another, no not to their great men, and Monarchs; onely they bow their bodies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But, coming to ſpeak of us European Chriſtians, he ſaith thus: <hi>Occidentales panè omnes Europai Chriſtiani Deum aperto capite, &amp; genu flexe orant, eíque ſupplicant, quiatum hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militatem &amp; reverentiam noſtram erga Deum oportet nos teſtari: Itaque id cogeſtu &amp; habitu fieri debet, &amp; decet, quo in Civili conſuetudine ſolemus cultum &amp; reverentiam noſtram erga ſuperiores teſtari, quodſanè jam inter Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paos fieri ſolet, capit is apertione, &amp; genuflexione.</hi> Almoſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118231:19"/>all the Weſtern European Chriſtians pray unto God with an uncovered head, and a bended knee, becauſe ſo it behoves us to teſtifie our humility and reverence towards God: Therefore is it neceſſary and comely to be done with the ſame geſture and habit, with which in the Civil cuſtom we are wont to teſtifie our reverence towards ſuperiours, which amongſt us Europeans is wont to be done by unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the head, and bowing the knee. Thus he. Now although we and the Turks differ in that point of Civil worſhip which concerns the head, (they uncovering not the head, which we do) yet we agree in that which concerns the knee, &amp; other reverent geſtures of the body; which is verily the moſt general and univerſal Cuſtom that is in the world; there being ſcarce any Nation, where Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours receive not this homage and civility from their Inferiours, and upon this ground account their god (whatever it be that they account their god) worthy of ſuch Bodily reverence in a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way.</p>
            <p>But we Chriſtians in the Weſt, are now ſo far declined from all due reverence and reſpect to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Gods Divine Majeſtie, that our bodies muſt not acknowledge him by kneelings and bowings, geſtures of reverence, which (in the Civil way) we plentifully exhibit unto men our ſuperiours, when we meet with them, or make our addreſſes to them. Now, if we did but rightly conſider Gods tranſcendency above men, and our own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to his Divine Majeſtie and Goodneſs, above whatever we do or can owe to all the men in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118231:19"/>the world, we ſhould ſurely ſee, that Corporal adoration is more due to God, in a Religious way, then unto Men, in a Civil.</p>
            <p>Though perhaps for all this, if the primaevity or fundamental conſtitution of Corporal adoration, Civil and Religious, be conſidered, it may ſeem a diſputable Queſtion, Which of the two is the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and which the Daughter: Whether the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil adoration be derived from the Religious, That, becauſe God himſelf is to have Religious adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, therefore Men, our Superiours, are to have a Civil, as having ſome analogie and reſemblance with God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86. 2. or, Whether the Religious adoration be derived from the Civil, That, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we worſhip Men with our Bodies, therefore we ought alſo to worſhip God. Which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be determined, the Civil worſhip to Men, will infer and ſtrongly eſtabliſh Religious Bodily worſhip towards God; which is the ſcope of the Argument.</p>
            <p>A Fifth Argument may be drawn from the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the holy Scriptures. <note place="margin">5 Argum.</note> If the Scriptures be not againſt it, they are for it: <note place="margin">Mar. 9.40.</note> 
               <hi>He that is not againſt us, is on our part.</hi> Where does the Scripture forbid that Bodily worſhip ſhould be given unto God? or, Where is it ſaid, that God condemned any for doing it? or, that Himſelf refuſed to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with the body? Many devout and humble ſuppliants have bowed, kneeled, and proſtrated themſelves unto God; and, Where is it written, that God rejected them, as if he would not have been worſhipped after that manner? This muſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118231:20"/>be plainly ſhewn; elſe it cannot be made good, that Bodily worſhip unto God is unlawful. But, ſinco the Word of God is altogether for it, and hath not one ſyllable againſt it, neither in the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor in the New; it muſt needs be, not onely lawful, but convenient and neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Where are then the odious aſperſions that are caſt upon it, in calling it <hi>Idolatry, Superſtition,</hi> and I know not by what other ſcandalous names? Would the Word of God, the lantern, light, and oracle of Truth, be ſilent, or connive at a ſin worthy of ſo hainous appellations, and neither countenance the oppoſers, nor condemn the practiſers of it? Would that Light want a ray to enlighten us in the knowledge of this, which by ſome is accounted ſo great an offence? Who will ſay that the Scripture is imperfect and deficient in a thing of ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence? But rather on the contrary; Have we not many, both Examples and Precepts, in the Old Teſtament, and in the New, for giving of Bodily worſhip unto God? Are not the words of this preſent Scripture, (firſt given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and now ratiſied by our Saviour) ſtrong enough to enjoyn Bodily worſhip, that they may ſatisfie any, but the wilfully obſtinate? Sure we are, that theſe words put the devil to ſilence: for when our Saviour ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them, the devil was forced to yeeld, having nothing to reply againſt them: And let not the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of Gods Bodily worſhip ſhew themſelves more ſtubborn then the devil was, leſt even he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them before God, for the neglect of that duty, with the truth whereof himſelf was ſo clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by Scripture-evidence.</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:118231:20"/>
            <p>But I will put the caſe: Suppoſe one who is an oppoſer of Gods Bodily worſhip, and withal, an hater of Idols, ſhould be tempted, as our Saviour was, to fall down, and worſhip the devil, or an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol, which the <note n="*" place="margin">Levit. 17.7. Pſal.106.37. 1 Cor. 10.20.</note> Scriptures call a devil: Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our having taught him to be furniſhed with Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, whereby to reſiſt temptations, Would he not think this place, which our Saviour made uſe of, a fit anſwer for himſelf? and would he not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge it, to put the tempter to ſilence? I trow he would alleadge, either this, or ſome other equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent place: And, Would he not then be driven upon neceſſity (againſt former miſlikings) to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Corporal adoration to be Gods due, and ſo even condemn himſelf, if he does not yeeld it unto him? Let him conſider this.</p>
            <p>A Sixth Argument may be drawn from the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Corporal adoration in heaven, <note place="margin">8 Argum.</note> 
               <hi>Rev. 5.14. And the four and twenty elders fell down,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rev. 4.10.</note> 
               <hi>and worſhipped him that liveth for ever and ever.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">7.11.</note> Earth ought to conform it ſelf to Heaven; <note place="margin">11.16.</note> the Church Militant to the Church Triumphant, <note place="margin">19.4.</note> in ſetting forth the honour and worſhip of God. Now, if it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful (or ſo great an offence as it is here made) to worſhip God with the body, S. <hi>John</hi> with his illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated eagles eyes, would ſcarce have ſeen ſuch a thing in heaven.</p>
            <p>It it ſhall be objected, that there were no ſuch bodies in heaven; when S. <hi>John</hi> ſaw this, he onely ſaw it repreſented in a Viſion: This is nothing; for the viſion of the thing in heaven, is ſufficient to approve the lawfulneſs, and authorize the practice
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:118231:21"/>of it here on earth. And let any gainſayer aſk him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: When he comes into heaven bodily, Does he think he ſhall not (with thoſe <hi>four and twenty elders</hi>) fall down before God, <note place="margin">
                  <q>Quis andeat affir mare Derſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanriam corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter videri, cum eam noluerit cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraliter adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri?</q>

Shall it be an high Happineſs in Gods Heavenly houſe, and Sin in his Earthly? Me thinks Reaſon it ſelf ſhould perſwade us, that Corporal reverence and worſhip ſhould be given unto God, here, as a neceſſary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for the doing of it hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">7 Argum.</note> A Seventh Argument may be drawn from the Majeſtie of God: If nothing elſe will prevail, one would think this ſhould. Is not he the Almighty God, infinite in Power, Greatneſs, Majeſtie, Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Glory? Does not he dwell <hi>in that light which no man can approach unto;</hi> the leaſt ray of which light is ten thouſand times brighter then the Sun? Are all the Kings in the world half ſo glorious as he? or their Thrones to be compared to his Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool? Does not he ſit upon a Throne of incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible glory, attended upon with thouſands of glorious and mighty Angels, that ſtand before him, admiring, worſhipping, bleſſing, praiſing, and crying continually, <hi>Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hoſts?</hi> And although he hath his dwelling ſo high, yet, Does he not <hi>humble himſelf to behold the things that are in heaven and earth?</hi> Does he not vouchſafe to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit theſe poor bodies of ours into his preſence, and permit them to appear before him, whereas he might juſtly debar them of this happineſ, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the infinite Diſparity betwixt Himſelf and

               <note place="margin">Jer. 2.12.</note> Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if any man may be ranked in the number of thoſe whom holy <hi>Job</hi> taxeth for rebelling againſt the light, <note place="margin">Job 24.13.</note> it is he that is perſwaded he may ruſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and be in Gods preſence, without reverence and worſhip. I ſay, <hi>Againſt the light:</hi> for it need not be doubted, but that even Nature, and Grace, do both of them project their light this way, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bodily reverence and worſhip unto God. <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> will bow in the houſe of <hi>Rimmon:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Kings 5.18.</note> ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe is Nature it ſelf to preſent Bodily adoration to that deity which the Fancie hath conceived.

If we muſt ſalute men in the houſe of God, (of which, for my part, <note place="margin">

Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute no man by the way.</note> I ſee no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, or not ſo Great neceſſity, as of that which reſpects God himſelf) it were good, if we would take notice of God firſt. But we can ruſh into Gods houſe, and there, diligently ſpend our ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and obeyſances upon this and that body; and God, becauſe he hath no Body, (to appear vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly honourable) muſt be accounted <hi>No body:</hi> Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhall have no worſhip at all, or a very ſlight one. For a man to come before ſo glorious a God, to hear, to pray, to ſing, and to do it with no more (nay perhaps leſs) reverence, then if he were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into ſome Trades mans ſhop, What is it to <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice

               <hi>as if be cut off a dogs neck,</hi> if this be not?</p>
            <p>But what occaſion does this adminiſter unto Heatheniſh Idolaters, to triumph over us Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that they ſhould be ruled by Nature, in giving reverence and worſhip to their gods (though falſe ones;) whereas we, who pretend much to Grace, will not be taught by it to adore and worſhip the true God, from whom our grace comes? Would any Idolater in the world, (though blinde, yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout in his way) be ſo irreverently looſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane before his Devil, as we before the great God of heaven and earth? Although ſuch Idolaters ſhall themſelves be condemned for their Idolatry, yet certainly they ſhall riſe up in judgement againſt us Chriſtians, and condemn us for our profaneneſs. As God urged the Heathens holding them to their gods, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 11, againſt the levity and inconſtancy of his own people, in changing him: ſo will he produce their reverence and worſhip to their gods, againſt our ſlackneſs, in not giving him that Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worſhip which is due unto him. Amongſt thoſe many ſins which threaten the ruine of this our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Nation, and call on us for amendment, we may juſtly fear that this is not the leaſt.</p>
            <p>Let us then, in the Name of God, conſider the Majeſtie of God, before whom we appear; our own unworthineſs to appear before him; the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite diſtance and diſproportion that is betwixt him and us; that his own eyes, and the eyes of his holy Angels, are upon us, obſerving our behaviour in coming into, and abiding in his preſence: that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:118231:22"/>we are called upon to yeeld him due reverence and worſhip, not onely with our Souls, but our Bodies likewiſe. And, if our hearts be not obſtinately bent to reſiſt the Truth, (which God forbid) we ſhall ſee what preſſing engagements lie upon us <hi>to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Lord our God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Arguments I conceive, both for number, and weight, ſufficient to eſtabliſh this Truth. Yet I ſhall make requeſt in the words of <hi>Elihu,</hi> Job 36.2. <hi>Suffer me a little, and I will ſhew thee, that I have jet to ſpeak on Gods behalf.</hi> I ſhall produce two Arguments more, and thoſe ſhall be from the very words themſelves; <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt of them ſhall be from the manner of our Saviours alleadging theſe words. <note place="margin">8 Argum.</note> Our Saviour immediately before, ſaith, <hi>Scriptumeſt,</hi> It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. Now we know that Bodily worſhip to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto God, is written in many places of the Old Teſtament. But what particular place is it, which our Saviour may be thought to have had reſpect unto, that this his allegation may be referred to it, and compared with it? I think it not amiſs to follow the margin in our Bibles, which directs us to <hi>Dent.</hi> 6.13. and <hi>Dent.</hi> 10.20. Examine either of the places, and compare them with our Saviours allegation, and ſee ſome difference in the terms. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Timebis,</hi> Thou ſhalt fear; and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaith, <hi>Adorabis,</hi> Thou ſhalt worſhip. And what may be the reaſon of this difference? I anſwer: The Feat of God may have a twofold conſideration. Firſt, to be taken ſtrictly, for an awful dread, <note place="margin">1.</note> ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, or trembling at God: Which Fear, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:118231:23"/>belonging to that paſſion or affection that is in the ſoul: and is, either upon a ſad apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Gods Juſtice, as was in <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.120. <hi>My fleſh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgements:</hi> or, upon the ſenſe of Gods Preſence, as was in <hi>Moſes,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Heb.12.21.</note> who <hi>exceedingly feared and quaked,</hi> at that fearful manifeſtation of God upon mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai.</hi> This Fear ſhould be in us all, at all times. Though we ſee not ſo much of God as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, yet we are in his preſence, and more eſpecially, when we come into his Houſe, there to preſent our ſelves before him. And this Fear ſhould beget in us Humility, Reverence and Worſhip towards ſo <note n="*" place="margin">Nehem.1.5.</note> great and terrible a God: Whence (as <hi>Piſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> obſerves) that which is <hi>Fear</hi> in that place of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> is rendered <hi>Worſhip</hi> by our Saviour in this place, by a Metonymie, the Effect being put for the Cauſe, <hi>worſhip</hi> for <hi>Fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They then who deny that Bodily worſhip is to be given unto God, and refuſe to yeeld it unto him, when they come before him, (though I will not judge them, yet) themſelves make it manifeſt by their rude carriage and demeanour, that they have not this fear in them: for, if they had, they would ſurely come into Gods preſence, worſhipping in the lowlieſt manner that poſſibly they could.</p>

            <p>The other Argument ſhall be from theſe words, <note place="margin">9 Argum.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord thy God.</hi> Becauſe he is ſo, therefore thou ſhalt worſhip him.</p>
            <p>This is a <hi>glorious and fearful Name,</hi> Deut. 28.58. Mercy and Majeſtie, Goodneſs and Greatneſs meet together in it. The due conſideration of it, may affect a man with high admiration, that a God of ſuch Majeſtie and Greatneſs, ſhould not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be called, The God of his people; <note place="margin">Heb.11.16.</note> 
               <hi>Their God,</hi> and, in them, <hi>Thy God:</hi> Every particular perſon in the number of thoſe that ſerve him, having this intereſs &amp; propriety in God, as well as the general, that he may ſay with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 63.1. <hi>O God, thou art my God.</hi> And, O Chriſtian, whoever thou art, if thou wilt ſay that God is thy God, Doſt thou not mean thy Whole ſelf, that he is the God of thy Bo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy, as well as of thy Soul; and that thy Body chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengeth an intereſs in God, with thy Soul? If ſo, Art not thou bound to worſhip him with the one as wel as with the other? This Argument is framed, <hi>Pſal 45.11. He is thy Lord, áud worſhip thou him:</hi> And more fully, <hi>Pſal. 95.6. O come, let us worſhip and how down,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:118231:24"/>let us kneel before the Lord our Maker:</hi> the reaſon whereof follows in the next verſe; <hi>For be is our God.</hi> Our relation to him, our propriety in him, ſhould make us, the people of God, reſolve to worſhip him. Suppoſe then, that a Congregation of people, in the preſence of God, be divided in their practice, ſome worſhipping God with their Bodies, others not: If the refrainers ſhall aſk the other why they bow, or kneel. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The other have a ready anſwer; <hi>He is the Lord our God,</hi> therefore we do and will worſhip him: ſo long as we bear theſe our bodies about with us, they ſhall acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge an homage and reverence to our God. And if theſe retort the Queſtion upon the other, and aſk, Wherefore do not you bow, nor kneel? What anſwer will theſe refuſers of Corporal adoration, return, that may relate to this Scripture? Will they ſay, We will not <hi>worſhip,</hi> nor <hi>how down,</hi> nor <hi>kneel,</hi> negatively in the duty, and yet hold the affirmative in the reſt; <hi>For he is ear God?</hi> This cannot hang together: They rather diſclaim God, and deny him to be their God, in refuſing to give him his due worſhip. I think they would be loath to have this laid to their charge; yet they will have an hard taſk to diſcharge themſelves: for, if they deny the duty, they go very far in denying the ground upon which the duty is founded.</p>
            <p>Thus I end the Arguments for Gods Bodily worſhip, and paſs to the ſecond way of proving it to be Gods due, which ſhall be by Teſtimony.</p>

            <p>And firſt, I ſhall produce Angelical teſtimony, or Mandate rather, (which is more:) for it does not onely teſtifie, but commands, as neceſſary. It is, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10. and 22.9. where we read, that twice S. <hi>John</hi> fell down at the feet of the Angel to worſhip him; but the Angel forbad him, <hi>See thou do it not;</hi> giving a reaſon of his prohibition; <hi>I am,</hi>

This were to caſt a foul aſperſion upon thoſe glorious ſpirits, and to accuſe them of errour. If that very ſame Angel ſhould appear to one of us, after the ſame manner, and ſhould have the ſame occaſion now, which he had then, I doubt not, but he would give the ſame word of command, <hi>Adorare Doum,</hi> to worſhip God.</p>

This will make me take a large leap over many centuries of pious and learned Authors, to inſiſt upon the ſuffrages of ſome in theſe laſt days, of whom the firſt ſhall be Mr <hi>Calvin:</hi> He, upon <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.7, hath theſe words: <hi>Hoc quoque no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandumeſt, non tantùm de cordis gratitudine hic agl, ſed ſimul requiri profeſsionem externa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pietatis: Hoc enim tribus verbis exprimitur, officio ſuo non defungi fideles, niſi palam, &amp; genuflexione, &amp; aliis ſignis, Deo ſe in ſacrificiû offerunt.</hi> This alſo (ſaith he) is to be noted, that the thankful acknowledgment of the heart is not here onely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, but the outward profeſſion of piety is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with it required: For this is expreſt in three words (meaning <hi>worſhip, bowing, &amp; kneeling,</hi> which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> there mentions) that the faithful cannot be ſaid to diſcharge their duty, unleſs openly, by bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the knee, &amp; other ſignes, they offer themſelves
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118231:27"/>in ſacrifice unto God. In like manner, upon <hi>Pſal. 96. 9. (O worſhip the Lord in the beauty of holineſs, fear before him all the earth)</hi> he comments thus: <hi>Pulchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinis nomine templo reverentiam conciliat Propheta, ne temerè proſiliant homines in conſpictum Dei, ſed metum &amp; humilitatem afferant: Eò pertinet clauſula ver ſûs,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremiſcite à facie ejus: <hi>ut reputantes quanta ſit Dei Majeſtas, ſimpliciter coram co incurvent.</hi> By the <hi>beauty of holineſs,</hi> the Prophet counſels reverence in the temple, that men ruſh not inconſiderately into Gods preſence, but ſhould bring along with them fear and humility: For, to this the clauſe of the verſe tends, <hi>Fear before him;</hi> that men conſidering how great the Majeſtie of God is, might humbly bow themſelves before him. Nor may I omit the teſtimony of the ſame Author upon this place of Scripture which we now handle. <hi>Sicuti religio pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prie ſpiritualis eſt,</hi>

Secondly, in regard of the infinite excellency of his Divine Attributes, eſpecially that he is the author and giver of all good things; that he hears and helps men every where calling upon him in the ſecrets of their hearts. And the adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is done even for the acknowledgement and ſignification of theſe things, is the adoration that is proper to God, and is therefore called Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine or Religious adoration; And of it Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if they who refrain from Corporal adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, meerly out of ſcruple of Conſcience, will give heed to Mr <hi>Perkins</hi> his declaration of this Caſe, he may be ſatisfied. He thus defines Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous adoration, differing but little from himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118231:28"/>It is that Worſhip of God, in which, <note place="margin">

Vol.2.pag.84.</note> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Godlineſs is exerciſed, expreſſed, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified: In it there be two things always joyned together, and yet diſtinctly to be conſidered. The firſt and principal, being the foundation of all the reſt, is, <hi>The intention of the Minde,</hi> whereby God is conceived, as an Abſolute and Omnipotent Lord, knowing all things, yea the heart of man; hearing the prayers of all men, in all places, at all times; the author, preſerver, and giver of all good things. The ſecond, depending upon the former, is, the Outward proſtrating of the body; as the bowing of the knee, and ſuch like, for this end, to teſtifie our ſubjection unto God, as our Abſolute Lord.</p>
            <p>They then who deny to worſhip God with their bodies, What do they elſe, but impair and diminiſh (what lies on their part) Gods Abſolute Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in withdrawing their bodies from under his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, ſo, as they ſhall not acknowledge any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage or worſhip to be due unto him?</p>
            <p>But, as if the tendring of Corporal adoration unto God were not onely an acknowledgement of his Univerſal Soveraignty which he hath over all his creatures, and whence, in a relative ſence, he is called LORD, but alſo an acknowledgement of his Divinity, and Abſolute Being in himſelf, whence he is called GOD; the ſame Author hath likewiſe theſe words: By Outward Divine worſhip, <note place="margin">Vol.3. pag. 403. Col.2.</note> we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Divinity to be in the thing whereto we bow or proſtrate our ſelves. Now, is it not neceſſary that all ways of acknowledging God for God ſhould be put in practice? And if any mans
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:118231:29"/>devotion ſhall ſecretly prompt him to make this recognition, What reaſon is there that any ſhould condemn him for it? Seeing the action of adoring God ſpeaks but the ſame which every man is bound to confeſs with his mouth, That God is the onely true God, and alone hath true Divinity in himſelf: According to that acknowledgement of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they were ſo fairly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed by <hi>Elijah</hi>'s ſacrifice, 1 <hi>Kings 18.39. They fell on their faces, and ſaid, The Lord he is the God, the Lord he is the God.</hi> So that they who ſhall condemn any for worſhipping God with their bodies, may as well condemn them for teſtifying with their mouthes the Divinity of God: And alſo themſelves, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their own refuſing to worſhip God after this manner, be condemned for not acknowledging Gods Divinity, as they ought, with thoſe Bodies which God hath given them; and, amongſt other purpoſes, for this principal one of adoration.</p>

For my own part (ſaith he) I take my ſelf bound to worſhip with body, <note place="margin">In hisſpeech in Star-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, pag.46.</note> as well as in ſoul, when ever I come where God is worſhiped: And were this Kingdom ſuch as would allow no holy Table ſtanding in its proper place, (and ſuch places ſome are) yet I would worſhip
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:118231:30"/>God, when I came into his houſe: And were the times ſuch as ſhould beat down Churches, and all the curious carved works thereof with Axes, and Hammers, as in <hi>Pſal. 74.</hi> (and ſuch times have been) yet I would worſhip in what place ſo ever I came to pray, though there were not ſo much as a ſtone laid for <hi>Bethel.</hi> My laſt authority ſhall be more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
            <p>When in the dawning of this Churches reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes, the night of idolatrous worſhip began to wear away; Our bleſſed refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, Spiritual and Temporal, in their endeavours to eſtabliſh an orderly method for the true worſhip of God, they ordered kneeling, at ſeveral times, in the performance of Gods Service: Nor did they intend any other object of their outward bodily worſhip, but only God. And our Brethren in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> were not diſagrecing from the ſame practice, and injunction: for Mr <hi>Knox</hi> (having been no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe taught in this by his great Maſter) compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Liturgie for the publick Uſe of that Church, this was one principal thing joyned, That the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and People ſhould proſtrate themſelves in the Celebration of their ſolemn Faſts: So far, was he, or they in thoſe dayes, from denying corporal reverence, and adoration to be Gods due, and juſt Prerogative. This conſent of a multitude, proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not from any heady inconſiderate raſhneſs, but from good advice, &amp; deliberation, is a good confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Gods propriety in our bodily worſhip.</p>
            <p>And though it be much ſpoken againſt no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes, by the ignorant, who cry it down at all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:118231:31"/>and by the careleſs profane not a whit practiced in the publick Aſſemblies: yet it might eaſily be hoped, the one would not condemn it, nor the other neglect it, but both would joyn with the profeſſion of this Service, if well and adviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they would but look into it: <note place="margin">Numb. 22.27, 28, 29, 30, 31.</note> As when <hi>Balaams</hi> Aſs ſaw the Angel of the Lord, ſhe fell down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Balaam,</hi> for which his anger was kindled, that he ſmote her with a ſtaff, and wiſhed that there were a Sword in his hand, for then would he kill her: yet afterwards, when his own eyes were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, he did the ſame thing, He bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face: Even ſo, if men, who are angry with the profeſſion of corporal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence unto God, and could find in their hearts to ſmite, and to kill ſuch as they obſerve to do it, would apply themſelves to a ſerious, and upright ſcrutiny of the thing, uſing thoſe helps whereby their eyes might be opened, and their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings enlightned (their Will not ſitting as Judge in the place of Reaſon) they would ſurely worſhip God, with their bodies, as others do: And withal, if they would conſider, how little they can have from the Writings of Divines to countenance their Oppoſition of Gods bodily worſhip. Pens are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly more deliberate then tongues: and though ſome mens tongues walk at liberty, and prate much againſt it, yet I have not ſeen, or heard, that any pen hath drop't ſo much as a letter in contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this, That God is to be worſhipped with the body: Nor do I think there can be a face ſo bold, as to do it. I know they may break forth into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:118231:31"/>againſt the corruptions, and abuſes of bodily worſhip, which for mine own part, I am as deſirous may be reformed, as any gain-ſayer of corporal adoration can be: And therefore for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this poor Treatiſe, I ſhall level a <hi>Caveat</hi> againſt two main evils, from which I deſire every good Chriſtian may be careful to keep himſelf, in his acts of corporal adoration: And theſe are Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and Hypocriſie: both which are high pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations unto God.</p>
            <p>For Idolatry: This is a groſſe abuſe, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>employment of our bodies: which God (having made them only for himſelf) will not that they ſhould do any religious homage to any, but to him alone, having, by his own expreſs Edict often rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated, excluded all things elſe whatſoever from having any part, or fellowſhip with himſelf in this ſervice. Though there be Angels, and Saints in Heaven, yet corporal adoration is not theirs, the Angels have refuſed it, and I doubt not but the glorified Saints (if they could ſignifie ſo much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us) are of the ſame mind, and would likewiſe ſhew that they do refuſe it. If St. <hi>Peter</hi> could be talked withal, he would ſurely diſwade from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral adoration (if it ſhould be tendered unto him, as, (being alive) he diſwaded <hi>Cornelius.</hi> Act. 10.25, 26. Though the <note n="*" place="margin">Acne quis hoc derivet ad <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam</hi> Virginem, <hi>Maria</hi> erat Templum Dei non Deus templi: &amp; ideo itle ſolus adorandus, qui operabatur in templo. <hi>Ambr. de Sp.Sa.lib.3. cap. 12.</hi> Sit in honore <hi>Maria,</hi> Pater, &amp; Filius, &amp; Spiritus ſanclus adoretur. <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan.haer.79.</hi>
               </note> Bleſſed Virgin be with Chriſt her Son, yet ſhe is not to ſhare with him in our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration: But if we will be wiſe, let us do like wiſe men, who, when they came where Chriſt and his Mother were, they fell down, and worſhipped only him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.11. moved (queſtionleſs) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:118231:32"/>by the ſecret inſtinct of the ſame Spirit, which conducted them thither. Nor ſhall I fear to ſay, That the Bread in the holy Euchariſt (his neereſt, and moſt lawful repreſentative in the world) is not to have any corporal worſhip done unto it: <note place="margin">3a patte 25.4. See Biſhop <hi>White</hi> againſt <hi>Fiſher, p.244.</hi> Dr <hi>Fearley</hi> in his Cla. Myſt. page 157.</note> much leſs his Image, Picture, or Croſs, whatever <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> and the Papiſts are pleaſed to ſay, That it is to be worſhipped with the ſame worſhip as Chriſt himſelf is.</p>
            <p>As for Images of Gold, or Silver, Wood, or Stone, we are not only ſtreightly charged by God himſelf to with-hold our adoration from them: but we may be diſwaded even by their own impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, vileneſs, &amp; unworthineſs; they being of our own making, inferiour to us, and regardleſs of us: In time of need they require more help from us then we can have from them: <note place="margin">Jer.10.5.</note> And they muſt needs be born, becauſe they cannot go: They have no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to accept, nor to make any retribution for what ever ſervice is done unto them: therefore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration is miſerably miſpent upon them: which ſhould ſettle this reſolution in the heart of every man, Seeing we can have nothing from them, they ſhould not have the leaſt thing from us:not a knee, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.18. not an eye, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.6. not an hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.21. But, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in another caſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.4. ſo ſay I in this of adoration, <hi>Ye ſhall not do ſo unto the Lord your God:</hi> ye ſhall not with-hold from him your knees, nor your eyes, nor your hands; but all your members ſhall expreſs their part in the worſhip of God: your bodies ſhall proſtrate themſelves before him alone, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:118231:32"/>any oblique reference to any created nature.</p>
            <p>And for Hypocriſie, Let us take heed of that likewiſe: that in adoreing, and worſhipping God, our bodies may not go alone, but our ſouls and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits may joyn with them in the action: Elſe, if we make fair outward profeſſions, in ſeemingly reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious bowings, and kneelings, and act not the ſame part within, we ſhall expoſe our ſelves, as laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtocks, and marks of vengeance in the ſight of God, and his holy Angels, and be as the <hi>Swan,</hi> which though it hath fair white feathers, yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving but black fleſh underneath, <note place="margin">Levit. 11, 18. <hi>Cauſinus.</hi>
               </note> was therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged an unclean Bird. Let then our care be, not only to do the thing, but to do it aright, in ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and truth, by aſſociating our ſouls with our bodies, when ever any occaſion be for us to give unto God the tribute of his worſhip. If we ſhall be careful of this, I dare promiſe theſe Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents: We ſhall nouriſh, and continue in our hearts an awe-ful reverence towards the moſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Majeſtie of God himſelf: We ſhall make our ſelves through the mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, acceptable in his ſight, when we preſent our ſelves before him: We ſhall give proof and teſtimony, that we acknowledge God for our God: We ſhall conform our ſelves to the judgement of judicious men who have approved it, to the examples of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Saints who have practiced it, to the Precepts in the holy Scripture, which requires it: We ſhall (and that in an excellent way) acknowledge our thankfulneſs unto God for his bleſſing of food and raiment, protection, and preſervation, and for
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:118231:33"/>thoſe (his principal ones) of Creation, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption upon theſe our bodies: And we ſhall (amongſt other acts of our obedience) ſend up our Religious adorations to ſtand as memorials be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, that (for the time to come) he may in all our ſtraits and neceſſities be mindful of us, in this preſent world, and (this being ended) bring us both ſouls and bodies into his everlaſting glory.</p>
