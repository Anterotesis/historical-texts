            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>UR Lord once asked a queſtion of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples; <hi>Are yee able to drink of the Cup that I ſhall drink of, and to be baptized with the Baptiſme that I am baptized with?</hi> In the anſwer he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with his ſervants, that it ſhould be ſo with them, <hi>Mat. 20. 22. 23.</hi> And as this was the caſe of <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John;</hi> ſo it was <hi>Peters</hi> and all the faithfuls alſo, and is now, and ever was Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants caſe and condition, to ſuffer with him, as truly as they ſhall reigne with him. For as the ſhadow followes the naturall body; ſo afflictions follow the Church, the children of Truth, his myſticall Body. And as there is an univerſall daily proofe of this truth; ſo in particular at <hi>Woolchurch, Anno 1645.</hi> for a modeſt and privat teſtimony of the the Witneſſes of ſound Doctrine, the teſtifier thereof was teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied againſt with contempt and reproach, which for the truths ſake he hath patiently born, not rendring evill for evill, or railing for railing, but contrariwiſe bleſsing, knowing that the Lord calls his ſervants thereunto, that they may inherit a bleſsing. And notwithſtanding the Pariſhioners his ſuffering, he being not thereby diſcouraged, went on in diſcovery of the truth, and in oppoſition of the
<pb facs="tcp:113525:3"/>
miſtakes, ſo that the queſtions were brought to publication in a ſmall ſhort Treatiſe called, <hi>Chriſtian liberty to the Lords Table:</hi> againſt which authorized Tract I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved divers exceptions from ſeverall friends, yea, friends, which doth the more take my affection: And the ſaid excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions under differing notions, as below are mentioned. All which, with my defenſive anſwers to each, I again preſent with open face to the world. And in concluſion, a briefe recitall of ſome ſhort Diſcourſes I have had in my journey in the Countries with ſuch as are oppoſite to the preſent government. And becauſe ſince the time my ſmall Taper was lighted, there hath riſen a man of much eminency, a burning glory, a ſtarre of great ſhining, holding forth with Scripture, Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Arts, the ſubject and matter of my meditations, yet the manner being different, and my phraſe, ſtile, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge like my ſelfe, low and mean, I therefore commend my thoughts to ſuch of my own capacity, caſting my mite into the Lords Treaſury, and thruſting in my weake and mean Sickle of plain workmanſhip into the Lords great harveſt, praying that all that read it with the ſame affection that I write it, may gain the like benefit.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE firſt thing I received by way of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my book, were ſix Arguments.</p>
            <p>My firſt Argument againſt your Treatiſe (ſaith my friend) called, <hi>Chriſtian liberty to the Lords Table,</hi> is this:</p>
            <p>Becauſe the Scripture doth not teſtifie of any particular man converted by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alone: Therefore it is a reaſon to me to beleeve the Sacrament doth not convert.</p>
            <div n="1" type="response">
               <head>My Defence to your firſt Argument.</head>
               <p>Friend, by your firſt Argument you ſeem to divide between the Scriptures and the Sacrament (in theſe words, <hi>By the Sacrament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone</hi>) which is a miſtaking the point in hand: For my book is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>Chriſtian liberty to the Lords Table;</hi> the Title thereof ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and preaching the quite contrary: for there can bee neither Chriſtians ſo called, nor Sacraments ſo inſtituted where there is no Scriptures. And that this might have been underſtood by you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Texts of the Old and New Teſtament alledged for proofe, with the place, Preacher, and hearers inſtanced, at <hi>Woolchurch</hi> in <hi>London.</hi> Secondly, there is no example that the reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures doe convert: ſhould any man beleeve therefore the Lord doth not many times convert by reading? We have no expreſſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to teſtifie that <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> with the reſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles by name, were outwardly baptized; ſhall we therefore not beleeve it? We doe not read that the Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, or Diſciples of Chriſt, did once or ever uſe the Lord prayer, although he commanded it, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 2. is it therefore un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>awfull to uſe it? And that the Supper of the Lord is a teaching Ordinance, as it is a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113525:4"/>
confirming ordinance, we ſhall have many times occaſion to cleare in making my defence.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="argument">
               <head>His ſecond Argument.</head>
               <p>I doe not read in Scripture that the Sacrament was adminiſtred to any Chriſtian Aſſembly, till ſome of that Aſſembly were begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to God by the word of truth, which makes me beleeve that it was for the Saints ſakes onely when it was inſtituted and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred; and ſo to confirm and not to convert, but to commemorate and ſtrengthen.</p>
            </div>
            <div n="2" type="response">
               <head>My defence to your ſecond Argument.</head>
               <p>I doe not read in all the Scriptures that the participation of the Lords Supper was denied any common beleever for want of ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all faith, and not being a ſpirituall Chriſtian: for although God did in a ſpeciall ſenſe inſtitute and ordain all his ordinances for his elects ſake for their regeneration and confirmation, their ſpirituall communion with God in Chriſt; yet I affirm, that among theſe faithfull, the outward and common Chriſtians did in the Apoſtles times, &amp; may now communicate in the outward &amp; common things of the word &amp; Sacraments: for <hi>they that gladly received the word, were baptized, and continued in the Doctrine, Sacraments and Prayer, Acts</hi> 2. 41, 42. And as it was thus at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſo it was at <hi>Samaria, Acts 8. Corinth, Epheſus, Coloſſe,</hi> and in all the Churches of the Saints. And therefore the outward ſignes of the Sacraments were not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for the Saints onely, but it is with Chriſtians in our time, as it was with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, that is, the elect, in theſe words, <hi>Gen. 17. 7. I will be thy God, and the God of thy ſeed:</hi> but the outward ſignes of the covenant belonged to all his ſeed ingenerall, and to the ſeed of all others that came to acknowledge the truth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the Scriptures.</p>

               <head>His third Argument.</head>
               <p>Becauſe the right uſe of the Sacrament is onely and alone with the faithfull; they onely have ſpirituall communion with the Lord, in whoſe remembrance it was inſtituted.</p>

               <head>My defence to your third Argument.</head>
               <p>In my defence to your ſecond Argument, the inference and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence thereof is, that the uſe of the Lords Supper is not for the Saints alone: for although the Saints have the bliſſe and beſt uſe of the Sacrament, yet not the onely uſe. And as they have a ſpeciall right, as ſpiritual Chriſtians, by faith to eat Chriſts fleſh, and drink

his bloud to their confirmation: ſo the unregenerate elect and common Chriſtians have a true right to the communication of the outward ſignes to their information and inſtruction, amongſt the faithful. For as the Paſchal Lamb was generally to be eaten by both ſorts of beleevers, <hi>Exod. 12. 43, 44. Circumciſe him</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>and then ſhall he eat thereof:</hi> ſo baptize the Chriſtian, and let him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine himſelfe touching the knowledge of the Lords Supper, and ſo let him eat, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 25<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 26, 27, 28. And here take notice by the way, that this examining a mans ſelfe is all one with the preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Paſſeover: for the true uſe of underſtanding the Lords Supper, and diſcerning the Lords body in knowing the meaning of the ſignes, is to lead us to repent of our ſins: and to repent is to eate no leavened bread; for this is to put out the leaven out of our hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 15. And the Apoſtles admonition to the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> is in effect the ſame that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> praieth for, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple before they came to the Paſſeover, might <hi>prepare their hearts to ſeek God, and that the Lord would pardon them that were not cleanſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the purification of the Sanctuary, 2 Chron. 30. 19. For</hi> (ſaith the Text verſ. 18.) <hi>a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes, Iſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Whatſoever God hath made teaching, that by his bleſſing may effect grace to whom it teacheth it: for the Word and Covenant of life is manifeſted and declared by preaching, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 3.

               <p>But the Supper of the Lord doth declare and ſhew forth his death from the tree of his ignominy, to the throne of his glory.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Supper of the Lord declareth and teacheth Chriſt ſo often as it is communicated, even untill his ſecond coming.</p>

               <p>But the communicating in the ſignes of the Lords body and bloud, calls him to mind, and keeps his death in remembrance to Chriſtians.</p>

                  <p>This objection is againſt the conſent of the three former Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts: for they all agree and teſtifie that as our Lord was eating the Paſſeover, he took bread and bleſſed it, and the cup and bleſſed it, which is the inſtitution of the Lords Supper. And this hee did before they or any of them roſe from the Table, <hi>Mat. 26. 26. Mark</hi> 14. 21, 22, 23. And S. <hi>Lukes</hi> witneſſe is beyond all exception, or any excuſe; <hi>Behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the Table, Luke</hi> 22. 21. Now <hi>John</hi> doth not at all ſpeak the leaſt tittle of the inſtitution of the Sacrament; and therefore his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that muſt be included in his diſcourſe before he makes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe mention of our Lords riſing from Supper, <hi>John</hi> 13. 4. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the reſt teſtifie that he inſtituted it as they were eating the Paſſeover before our Lord did riſe from Supper, even while they were eating, at the later end of the Paſſeover, as at the end of the firſt courſe at a feaſt, the ſecond courſe is brought in, in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Jeſus inſtituted the Supper of his paſſion.

The Bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt? For we being many, are one bread and one body: for wee are partakers of that one bread.

                  <head>My defence to your firſt Suppoſition.</head>
                  <p>Sir, the anſwer lies in the Apoſtles words by you mentioned: for to ſay, <hi>For the cup of bleſſing which we bleſſe, and the bread which wee breake, is it not the communion of the body and bloud of Chriſt?</hi> proves plainly, there are two things conſiderable in the Sacrament, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or ſignes, bread and wine; the ſubſtance or thing ſignified, the body and bloud of Chriſt, of both which the regenerate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate; but the unregenerate, although acknowledging the common faith, they of bread and wine the ſignes onely. And this is plainly proved by the Apoſtle by the inſtance hee gives to the <hi>Corinthians, 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The multitude as well as the faithfull they paſſed through the ſea, they had equall benefit of the coole moiſt cloud in the heat of the day, and of the light hot bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning pillar in the dark cold night, and ſuſtained both with the ſame Manna,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113525:9"/>
Angels food. And yet none did communicate of the ſpirituall ſubſtance the Rock and Truth, but ſuch as were ſpiritual, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by could by faith eat Chriſts fleſh, and drink his bloud: and all the regenerate and truly faithfull did ſo; <hi>But with may of them</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) that is, with the carnall, impenitent, provoking, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving part, <hi>God was not well pleaſed, but overthrew them in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe,</hi> notwithſtanding their outward fellowſhip and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the faithfull in the outward externall ſhadowes. And the Apoſtle by way of compariſon, ſeems to make the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth,</hi> and the Church of the Jews in the wilderneſſe to agree in the like participation with thoſe that communicate, as in the things communicated, both for the quality of perſons, and diſtinction of ordinances. And if it were not ſo, as you would ſuppoſe, then his exhortation were in vain, <hi>Neither be yee Idolaters, as ſome of them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fornicators, nor tempters, nor murmurers, &amp;c.</hi> And if faulty and unregenerate Chriſtians ought not upon any terms to comunicate, then the Apoſtle in Chap. 11. would have forbidden them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, whereas he uſes onely admonition. And therefore as for the inward and ſpirituall Chriſtians, the ſpirituall part of the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is peculiar, ſo the externall and common part is for ſuch Chriſtians as are but outward and common, and ordained for them as for the Saints, as before hath been ſhewed.</p>

And it may be ſaid to them as to the gueſt that bad not on the wedding Garment, <hi>Friend, how comeſt thou in hither?</hi> And their intruſion to the Lords Table, is like the falſe Apoſtles and Prophets thruſting themſelves into all the adminiſtrations of the Goſpel.</p>

                  <p>The firſt part of this Suppoſition being an inference of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, by conſequence is anſwered already. And whereas you ſay, It is an intruſion in the unregenerate, and ſo a ſin in them to come to the Sacrament, you muſt ſhew the inhibition: for otherwiſe the text is plain, <hi>Where there is no law, there is no tranſgreſſion.</hi> Secondly, you inſtance the uncloathed mans coming to the Feaſt in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:113525:10"/>
I pray conſider, hee was not condemned for coming to the Feaſt, but for being there without a wedding Garment: for the feaſt is all the ordinances of God which Chriſt hath purchaſed, and freely vouchſafed for all men to communicate in for their ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the coming to the feaſt is the free liberty that all beleevers have in the enjoyment of theſe ordinances, and to bee fed and clad with the bleſſed ſpirituall benefit thereof, is to enjoy the bleſſing and ſalvation that comes by theſe means ordained of God for that end: but to enjoy the adminiſtration thereof, and not to be bettered by them, is to be there where we might have been clad, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue naked, fed, and are yet ſtarved. And ſo it comes to paſſe, that which is a ſavour of life to the one, is a ſavour of death to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the firſt heareth and obeyeth, the ſecond heareth and reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. In the next place I anſwer, Whoſoever taketh upon him to be a Steward of that which is anothers, being not comitted into his hands, preſumes of himſelf, and is an intruder: but this is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be the caſe of a beleever that is baptized, to communicate in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, therefore the inſtance fails for your purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Now to put an end to all further diſputes upon theſe two points, that <hi>Judas</hi> did communicate or pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But I challenge the whole world to prove the negative, that the elements of the Lords Supper do not teach, and that <hi>Judas</hi> was not preſent at the inſtitution. And by the way take notice that no abſurdity can poſſibly be a conſequence of truth, but erring and miſtaking admits of little elſe: For if the ordinance of the Lords Supper have not a teaching and informing quality, then it is uſeleſſe to all the unregenerate, yea to all the elect before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>neration, which is ſuch an abſurdity to affirme, that Gods out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and common ordinances are of no uſe but unprofitable: And that God ordained any thing in vain, this is ſo groſſe, that it croſſes all Scriptures; for they generally affirm, that all that God hath made or ordained, ſhew forth &amp; teach his glory, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 75. 1. Again, if
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:113525:10"/>
none but the regenerate ſhould communicate of the Supper of the Lord, the paucity is ſuch as the Scriptures witneſſe, that there is but one of a Citie, and two of a Tribe; yea it will alſo follow, that he that bleſſeth and diſtributeth the bread and wine, muſt know the receivers converſion, or elſe he ſinnes in communicating it: theſe and an hundred more abſurdities will follow, that a wiſe man will bluſh to think of. For if this be ſo, then the ſame things that ſhew forth Chriſt under the Goſpel, ſhall not be ſo uſefull to beleevers as the ſhadowes under the Law. And this were to turn the day in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to night, the light into darkneſſe.

                  <p>In this firſt Poſition we muſt conſider foure things: Firſt, that the gatherers and avouchers of ſelected congregations, are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in profeſſion, not in authority, but under Chriſtian authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and members of Chriſtian congregations, in communion in all Gods externall ordinances, and in all theſe reſpects are thoſe alſo that they gather to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what is meant by congregations, for aſmuch as there are three ſorts of them; that is, firſt, authorized congregations; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſelected or covenanted congregations in oppoſition to authority; and thirdly, ſpirituall or voluntary congregation, the communion of Saints.</p>

                  <p>In the firſt place therefore we muſt conſider, that all ſelect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> teachers and people, are Chriſtians in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and already in communion and fellowſhip in the ordinances of the Goſpel, being all under Chriſtian Authority. And notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, they doe take up and aſſume authority to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo to ſelect and congregate as they doe in oppoſition to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to which they are ſubjected of God. And for proofe of this their practiſe, they alledge the example of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 1, 2, 5. our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 15, 16. and the Apoſtles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <hi>Acts 2. 37, 38, 41, 42. Acts</hi> 11. 20, 21, 22. Now I deny that any of theſe Scriptures come home to prove the ſtate of your queſtion, or warrant your practice: For <hi>John,</hi> our Lord, and the Apoſtles, taught the doctrine of the Goſpel, that Jeſus was the Chriſt, the Meſſiah propheſied of to ſuch Jewes as were not beleevers, but op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of it and them. And ſuch by their Miniſtery converted to the faith, which faith is beleeved and confeſſed by ſuch Chriſtians as you ſelect to your ſelves. And ſecondly, the <hi>Greeks</hi> that were converted, <hi>Acts</hi> 11. 20. were ſo converted from heatheniſme to Chriſtianiſme; but this is not your caſe nor practice; for you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert Chriſtians from ſound and wholſome doctrines, to vain jang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings about words that edifie not. And from thoſe Aſſembles aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by Chriſtian authority to ſuch as are of your own ordaining, deviſing and conſtituting, the matter and form thereof is not to be found in Gods word. Now if any of you all could ſhew me a people that you have gained from among the Jewes, and from among the Heathens, to the acknowledgement and confeſſion of the doctrine of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and that by your Miniſtery that they have not onely beleeved the truth, but obeyed it in the power of it, to the effecting in them repentance and remiſſion of ſinnes; then I would ſpeak and change my diſcourſe to another ſenſe; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard you aſſume that which you are not, I will onely teſtifie unto you, that that which you doe is not warrantable by Scripture, but it is your own carnall fancy and imagination.</p>
                  <p>Now the ſecond thing in the Poſition is, what is meant by <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,</hi> and in the threefold diſtinction the firſt is Authorized congregations, which are uſually called Pariſhes; and that is to ſay, ſo many Families aſſigned by authority to make a congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to communicate in Gods ordinances for the ſalvation of the people.

And are not their Ordinances and Rules ſuch, without which wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not communicate in the outward ordinances of God? Wherefore let us acknowledge their authority, and obey their rules. But in the next place, the ſelected congregations alledge, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 17. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 18. 4. for their ſeparation and ſelection, for as much as the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt ſaith, <hi>Come out from amongst them,</hi> (meaning corrupt Chriſtian congregations) <hi>and be yee ſeparate, ſaith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you.</hi> This Scripture, you ſay, proves the ſtate of the queſtion on your part: for you ſay, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles here ſpeake of the Antichriſtian church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy unclean doctrines were ſuch, that notwithſtanding they were Chriſtians in profeſſion, yet Gods people could not communicate with them, but they muſt (there was no avoyding it by reaſon of their abominable canons) be defiled with them. And therefore you ſay, theſe texts of Scriptures are a ſufficient ground to ſeparate from Chriſtian congregations. I anſwer, they are a ground to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from ſuch Antichriſtian congregations as the Apoſtles ſpeak of; but I require of you to prove the abomination, the unclean thing in the authorized congregations in <hi>England,</hi> and then you ſay ſomething: but till that be proved, this Scripture is not for your purpoſe. For the Church of <hi>England</hi> by the Parliaments of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt, and Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the falſ doctrines and unclean practices of the church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and then made acts, lawes and ordinances againſt the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable tenets, and falſe deviſed imagined religion, their Prieſts &amp; Sacrifices, and back't their decrees with the penalty of death; yet notwithſtanding in proceſſe of time, the Prelaticall clergy brought in many corrupt innovations, tending to act again the old unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes under new pretences: yet this honorable Parliament hath roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted up and extirpated the Prelaticall Hierarchy root and branch, and ſtill ſit ſpending their wits, ſpirits and pains, for the reforming of Doctrine and Diſcipline, that all congregations may bee regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in and by the neereſt way agreeable to the word of God.

                  <p>But a Miniſter in the North countrey told me, the <hi>Independent congregations</hi> were this communion of Saints, which is the laſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in the firſt <hi>Poſition:</hi> To whom I anſwered, His expreſſion was very ſtrange to me: for I did not find any ſuch name expreſſing creatures, written in the book of life. And I am ſure all the Saints names are written there: Wherefore (ſaid I) hee that gives that name to any people, and thoſe that take that name unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are both alike to be blamed: for there is no one nor very many creatures, can be ſaid to be <hi>Independent,</hi> but God alone, the great creator. <hi>I am the firſt and the laſt, ſaith the Lord, and beſides mee there is no God, Iſaiah 44. 6. And thou, even thou art Lord alone, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem.</hi> 9. 6. There is not a Saint, nor congregation of holy ones can ſay one to another, I have no need of thee: for they are all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers one of another, and every one the members of Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 25. chap. 5. 30. 1 Cor.</hi> 12. I wonder that ſo many learned that profeſſe that way, and own the name <hi>Independent,</hi> I wonder, I ſay, that their learning doth not afford them a more proper terme, for as much as under this notion they aim at liberty of conſcience. Were they not better to expreſſe themſelves under the names of <hi>Religious freedome,</hi> for this is the effect of your practice, which affirm in this governed church in which you are placed under au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, you ought to have freedome of conſcience to exerciſe your gifts, to gather a people to your ſelves, and ſo to make uſe of all the ordinances of God both for Doctrine and Diſcipline. And
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:113525:13"/>
that no power nor authority ought to queſtion you for it, becauſe you ought to have freedome of conſcience. This is another conceit of humane invention. Did you ever read of ſuch an expreſſion in the Scriptures, ſo applied as to free a man from all lawfull obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to authority? the conſequence of truth is ſincerity, but the conſequence of error is iniquity: For think you not that your free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of conſcience, as you call it, which doth acquit you from all obedience to lawful commands, if you your ſelfe ſhall ſo judge of it, is not your own wilfulneſſe to diſobey that authority that is over you, a permanent ground for the like freedome for all in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar that are under you, to diſcl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ime your authority, upon the ſame terms you doe others? See in a word, how you by miſtaking the word, overthrow Gods ordinance of government, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. even that which himſelfe is God of, for <hi>he is the God of Gods, Dan. 2. 47. &amp; the God of order, 1 Cor.</hi> 14. 33. Now to make your abſurdity more manifeſt, obſerve a ſimilitude, make the whole Kingdome of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> the great nationall church, make the Parliament and aſſembly of Miniſters the Ruling and Teaching Elders in this great church, your ſelves neither of them, but under this authority. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the law of God and man ought to live obediently to all their lawfull ordinances. You pretend by religious freedome you ought not to obey them, but rather to follow your own conceivings: Is not this your practice of diſobeying your Superiours, a perpetuall ground for diſobedience in your inferiours? For that inferiour who ever he be, that ſaith, none above him hath power to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe rules to him, his own practice for ever frees all that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from all manner of obedience to him: and ſo for ever to eſtabliſh by this doctrine ſuch diſſenting and contending, as that there is <hi>no ſuch cuſtom in the churches of God, 1 Cor.</hi> 11. 16. for the rule of Gods church is the quite contrary, as the Apoſtle teſtifieth, <hi>Rom. 13. 7. Render therefore to all their dues, tribute to whom tribute is due, cuſtome to whom cuſtome, fear to whom feare, honour to whom honour.</hi> It is true the Saints and children of God are free, but that is in a ſpirituall reſpect, by a ſpirituall birth, <hi>The truth ſhall make you free, John 8. 32. If the Sonne make you free, you ſhall bee free indeed, verſe</hi> 36. but with the right knowledge of this freedome, I find few profeſſors are acquainted.</p>

                  <head>My defence to your ſecond Poſition.</head>
                  <p>There are three things conſiderable in this Poſition alſo: Firſt, what you mean by <hi>Ordinances:</hi> Secondly, their <hi>ſpirituall adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and purity:</hi> And laſtly, what you mean by <hi>ſetting Chriſt up in his throne to the fulfilling of all the Propheſies and promiſes in the Scriptures.</hi> And firſt for the term <hi>Ordinances,</hi> are they not thoſe that wee have in communion in our publick Aſſemblies, prayer, reading and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding the Scriptures, preaching, and in communicating in bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme and the Lords Supper? Is not the word of God the ſame in publick congregations, as amongſt you: the ſame in a common and the ſame in a ſpeciall adminiſtration? Is not prayer the ſame in both with the ſpirituall, the ſacrifice of a broken heart, with the reſt, a preſentation of perſons and words? Is not baptiſme the ſame in the outward as in the inward conſideration? The Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the ſame in the corporall ſignes, as in the ſpirituall grace, that as the carnall Chriſtian through the common faith, eats the bread, and drinks the wine; ſo the ſpirituall Chriſtian by juſtifying faith, eats Chriſts fleſh, and drinks his bloud. You confeſſe all this to bee true; but you ſay the difference lies in the point of the purity of the ordinances, the manner of adminiſtration and communion in them, which is the ſecond conſideration in the <hi>Poſition.</hi> And you ſay, for want of the ſpirituall adminiſtration, the authorized congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have loſt the purity of all Gods ordinances, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by continue the abominable and unclean thing amongſt them. And you give three inſtances to prove this: Firſt, that our Miniſter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> are not truly called: ſecondly, ſay ſome of you, we alter the ordinance of baptiſme: thirdly, you all with one conſent condemne us, for admitting of mixt congregations. To the firſt I anſwer, Presbyters by the Parliament are ordained to examine, approve, and allow of mens gifts, and for their ſpirituall gifts received of God, to appoint and allow of them therefore to be Miniſters according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles rule, 1 <hi>Tim. 3. 10 chap.</hi> 4. 14. againſt which there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther externall rule to be ſhewed in the Scriptures. And ſecondly, whereas many of you ſay, we alter the ordinance of baptiſme, it is more then you can prove by Scripture: for although it be ſaid,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:113525:14"/>
                     <hi>Matth. 28. 19. Go yee therefore and teach all Nations, baptizing them, &amp;c.</hi> In your own underſtanding of that place, it doth not ſay there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as you ſay, ye ſhall not baptize the infants of beleevers, who you therein forbid to be brought to Chriſt, contrary to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of our Lord, <hi>Matth. 19. 14. Suffer little children to come,</hi> or to be brought, <hi>unto me;</hi> for ſo much the Text inferres, <hi>and forbid them not to come unto me, &amp;.</hi> Which inhibition of yours is contrary alſo to Gods own ordinance and command, <hi>Exod. 12. Gen.</hi> 17. which plainly commands that which you deny, that children are to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate if their parents were beleevers. According to which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God the Apoſtles teſtifie to all the world, <hi>Acts 2. The promiſe belongs to you and to your children, and to all that are afarre off, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to ſo many as the Lord our God ſhall call;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever God calls to beleeve, the covenant belongs to them and to their infants, as the covenant belonged to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to all ſtrangers that ſhould come to beleeve the truth, to them and to their children alſo. And this is the reaſon that we find it written, and there are many examples of it in the Apoſtles times, that when a man came to beleeve the truth, the doctrine they taught them, not onely they themſelves but their houſholds were baptized, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. as the houſhold of <hi>Stephanos,</hi> and the reſt. And the Apoſtle reſolves the queſtion to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> ſaith he to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <hi>If one of the parents be a beleever, then are your children holy,</hi> that is, then have they right to the externall ordinance of God; and in this ſenſe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God hath ſhewed me not to call any man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy, or unclean,</hi> that is, whoſoever beleeveth Jeſus Chriſt come in the fleſh, may be baptized, although before a Gentile, and they and their houſhold have right to Gods holy ordinance, as <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his houſhold, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. And when you can prove that the Miniſter taking infants into his arms, praying for them, and waſhing them in the name of Chriſt (or <hi>Abrahams</hi> circumciſing of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> at the command of God) is more then Chriſts taking them into his arm; and bleſſing them, then you will ſay ſomething, till then you declare your own fancy, and ſay nothing to the purpoſe. And for mixt congregations as you find fault with, I pray, are you ſure your ſelves are not weeds and cockle, but good corn? if your ſelves were ſpirituall, then you would know and underſtand the meaning of Gods ſpirit, that both muſt be let alone till the harveſt, the end of the world, as our Lord ſaith, for till then there is no ſeparation,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113525:14"/>
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. 30. but wicked <hi>Cain</hi> may bring and offer his ſacrifice with <hi>Abel</hi> the righteous; perſecuting <hi>Iſhmael</hi> may communicate in the ordinance of God with perſecuted <hi>Iſaac:</hi> the bitter and unclean hypocrite <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> may bee waſhed or baptized in fleſh, as well as <hi>Philip, Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and the holy ones of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. And although our Lord knew the Devilliſh treacherous heart of <hi>Judas,</hi> yet his participation in the ordinances, neither in Baptiſme, the Paſſeover, or the Lords Supper, did not prejudice, nor no way hindered the ſpirituall communion of the faithfull, for he partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated in prayer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. in preaching, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. in baptiſme, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 15. in the Paſſeover and Supper of the Lord, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 14, 15, 21. and yet none of Chriſts little holy ones makes your complaint; for his carnall preſence did no way detrifie their ſpirituall fellowſhip.</p>
                  <p>And in the third and laſt place, we are to underſtand what is meant by ſetting up Chriſt upon his Throne, and the fulfilling and accompliſhing of all the propheſies and promiſes witneſſed by the Apoſtles and Prophets. And here now as with one conſent you doe all of you unanimouſly affirm, that all the Propheſies in the whole Scriptures, are fulfilled in your congregated companies, and that in doing that which you doe, in aſſuming to your ſelves power to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect congregations, and preſcribing to them the rules of Chriſt, as you call them, although indeed they are rules of your own making, yet you therein ſet up Chriſt upon his throne, and that your churches, wayes, and deviſed order, the matter nor manner thereof, being that which is not to be found in Scriptures, yet you give it out to the world, that by you, and in your church government, is fulfilled the propheſie of the new heavens, and new earth, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of God, and witneſſed by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and the Apoſtle <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> the heavenly countrey and citie that <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob ſought for, Heb. 11. the new Jeruſalem that John ſaw come down from God out of heaven, and Sion that holy and heavenly citie, that great and ſtrong citie that God hath appointed ſalvation for walls and bulwarkes, Jer. 23. 5. 6 chap. 34. 15, 16. Ezek. 37. 26, 27, 28. chap.</hi> 48. 35. and that of your gatherings it may be ſaid, <hi>the Lord is there,</hi> applying to your ſelves <hi>Sions own happines, Zeph. 3. 13, 14, 15, 16, &amp;c. Iſa.</hi> 49. 21.</p>
                  <p>Is it poſſible there ſhould be ſuch groſſe blindnes in theſe daies, in which men ſay they ſee, and are in the light, wherfore their great darkneſſe, and all their bold avouchments like empericks, which fil market places with noiſes, and churches and chambers, publick

The firſt queſtion is, <hi>What is the throne of Chriſt?</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>when the time ſhall bee that Chriſt ſhall ſit in his own throne.</hi> Thirdly, what is meant by <hi>Sion,</hi> mentioned by the Prophets. And fourthly, what we are to underſtand of the <hi>Churches glorious condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, her deliverance and perfection</hi> the Scriptures ſo often ſpeak of.</p>
                  <p>Now Chriſts throne is, that which he calls his <hi>own throne,</hi> as a note of diſtinction between <hi>his throne</hi> and <hi>his Fathers throne;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith, <hi>Rev. 2. 21. To him that overcometh will I give to ſit with me in my throne, even as I alſo overcame and am ſet down with my Father in his throne.</hi> And of this throne our Lord ſpeaks, <hi>Mat. 19. 28. when the Son of man ſhall ſit in the throne of his glory, verily yee alſo that have followed me in the regeneration, ſhall alſo ſit, &amp;c.</hi> And of this throne of the Sonnes, and not called the Fathers, is that throne the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, <hi>Heb. 1. 8. But unto the Son he ſaith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever, a ſcepter of righteouſneſſe is the ſcepter of thy kingdom.</hi> And the Prophet calls him <hi>God</hi> alſo, <hi>Pſal. 45. 6.

In which we muſt mind a double reſpect, firſt, as the term <hi>Sion</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Churches eſtate of regeneration in this preſent life. And ſecondly, as it is referred to the Churches eſtate of perfection in the life that is to come. In the firſt ſenſe the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks of her, <hi>chap. 2. 3. For out of Sion ſhall go forth a law, and the word of the Lord from Jeruſalem.</hi> And again, <hi>chap. 40. 9. O Sion that bringeth good tidings, O Jeruſalem, that bringeth good tidings, ſay, Behold your God.</hi> So ſaith another Prophet, <hi>Out of Sion the perfection of beauty, God hath ſhined, Pſa.</hi> 50. 2. even ſhined forth in the clear revelation of the truth and law of life, <hi>the covenant of grace,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 10.

And that you may know your indictment, behold and heare what they ſay further in evidence againſt your doctrines: For thus ſaith the Prophet <hi>Zephany</hi> of the churches eſtate of the life to come, which you affirm is meant of this life, <hi>The remnant of Iſrael</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall not doe iniquity, nor ſpeak lies, neither ſhall a deceitfull tongue bee found in their mouth: for they ſhall feed and lie down and none ſhall make them afraid.

                     <hi>hath taken away thy judgements, he hath caſt out thy enemies, the King of Iſrael, even the Lord, is in the midſt of thee, thou ſhalt not ſee evill any more,</hi> Zeph. 3. 13. Is not this the Lords return again to his church for her everlaſting comfort? And of this return of our Lord, and deliverance of his church, are all other Scriptures to be underſtood, which you have mentioned. Then and not before will the Lord perform that good thing promiſed by <hi>Ieremy, chap. 23. 14. Behold, the dayes come, ſaith the Lord, that I will perform that good thing I have promiſed to the houſe of Iſrael, and the houſe of Iudah. In thoſe dayes and at that time will I cauſe the branch of righteouſneſſe to grow up unto David, and he ſhall execute judgement and righteouſneſſe in the land; in thoſe dayes ſhall Iudah be ſaved, and Ieruſalem ſhall dwell ſafely. And this is the name wherewith he ſhall be called, The Lord our Righteouſnes. And in the day of the Lords return to this Citie, the Lambs wife, it ſhall be ſaid, The Lord is here, Ezek.</hi> 48. 15. But to leave theſe miſtakers to their great miſtakings, I will ſpeake one word to the bleſſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecters, the ſonnes of <hi>Sion,</hi> the children of hope, Be comforted, beloved, for now it is but twenty dayes and the funerall day will come of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the ſonnes of confuſion; and it will hardly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed fourty foure dayes more, but your bleſſed expectation will be accompliſhed: for in the midnight of that day there ſhall be a great cry made, Behold the Bridegroome cometh, and then bleſſed Bride go out to meet him for evermore to enjoy him with unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able joy, to whom be glory world without end. <hi>Amen.</hi>
