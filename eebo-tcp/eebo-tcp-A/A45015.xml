            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Humble Petition of the Citizens of London, Intended to be Preſented to the Right Honourable, the <hi>Lord Mayor, Aldermen,</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> in <hi>Common-Council</hi> Aſſembled.</head>
            <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
            <p>THat whilſt They were under the Superintendancy of a Vigilant and Careful Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Authority, They could ſpend Their time in Their ſeveral Callings, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either troubling this Honourable Court, or themſelves with Matters of State; But Their Natural Affection to Their Native Country, together with Their Intereſt in this Great City, moving Them, and the Univerſal decay of Trade giving Them too much lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, They cannot in this day of Calamity be ſilent, without rendring themſelves Inſenſible and Guilty; And therefore They Humbly crave leave to Repreſent unto this Honourable Court,</p>
            <p>That ever ſince the firſt Interruption of Government, not only this City, but the whole Nation hath been in a languiſhing Condition, as to Their Stock and Trade.</p>
            <p>That the Incomparable Honour and Renown which this Common-wealth was arrived at in the World (being an admiration and terrour to Their Neighbours round about Them) is by theſe late Years diſturbance of Government, laid in the duſt, and Our Nation in great danger of being rendred a Scorn, Reproach, and Prey to Forreigners.</p>
            <p>That as Our Parliaments have alwaies been the Peoples ſafety and ſecurity, ſo it could not but rejoyce Our Hearts, to have the <hi>Long Parliament</hi> reſtored to the diſcharge of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of Their Truſt, that being the only Power who can derive Legal Authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments to Poſterity, put an end of Uſurpation, and lay the Foundation of Succeſsive Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments; And the Army by Their Declaration owning Them to be the Eminent Aſſertors of the True <hi>Good Old Cauſe,</hi> having a ſpecial Preſence of GOD with Them, and Signally Bleſſed in the Work.</p>
            <p>That through the preſent varieties of Changes, We are Reduced under the only Legal Adminiſtration of Your Lordſhip, and this Honourable Court.</p>
            <p>That whereas GOD's Preſence and Bleſsing hath alwaies gone along with this Nation, whilſt They have kept Faith with Their Governours, and His diſpleaſure ſufficiently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted when They have done otherwiſe: That the Peace and Quiet of this Nation depends upon ſuch Foundations as may not be objected againſt for Uſurpation, and may leave as few dormant Titles as may be, for any diſcontented and unquiet Parties to Head themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: That the Nations Security, under GOD, is in Parliament; and that at preſent for want thereof, We of this Nation, and in particular, this City, are under the juſt Adminiſtration of Your Lordſhip, and this Honourable Court, the City being the Bul-wark of the Nation.</p>
            <p>Therefore We moſt <hi>Humbly Pray;</hi>That Your Lordſhip and this Honourable Court would effectually endeavour the Reſtauration of the Parliament, to the Exerciſe of their Lawful Authority, That thereby We and Poſterity may timely have Lawful Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Government laid in Succeſsive Parliaments; And that in the <hi>Interim,</hi> Your Lordſhip and this Honourable Court would take ſpeedy Care of the Peace, Quiet, and Safety of this Great City, by the Hands of Perſons of Intereſt, and known Integrity, for the preventing all dangerous Meetings, Inſurrections, and Tumults: <hi>And We ſhall aſsiſt You with Our Lives, Intereſts, and Fortunes.</hi>
