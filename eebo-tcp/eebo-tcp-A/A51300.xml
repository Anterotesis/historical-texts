         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <opener>Reader,</opener>
                  <p>THou maist very well marvell what may be the meaning that I should publish the Writings of another, the Authour being yet alive and at leisure to do it himself: But I can inform thee, though it perhaps may seem a Riddle to thee, that he is alive and not alive. For when I treated with him concerning this matter, I found him quite dead to all such kind of busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses. His Constitution is grown so unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly and astonishingly grave or sower, I know not whether to call it, that there is now, as I told him, some small hopes that he may be brought off in time, to put on a pair of Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin eares, or wear a silk cap with as many seams as there be streaks in the back of a Lute, as himself expresses it, in the Preface to his <hi>Reply,</hi> Assuredly, said I, <hi>Mastix,</hi> thou hast an ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of being one of those venerable Idols, or stalking peices of Gravity, to whom little boyes smack the top of their fingers so loudly, making long legges; and young girls and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men drop so demure courtsies to as they passe by in the street. How strongly is my friend <hi>Mastix</hi> metamorphosed within this space of three or four yeares.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:115239:4"/>But <hi>Parresiastes,</hi> said he, is I perceive, the same man still, as merry and unluckie as ever: and for my self I am not so much changed or sunk into thy present temper, but that I can with the same patience bear with thy frolicks, as I could with others sullennesse in the dayes of my jollitie. But I know by certain and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved experience, that there is nothing so safe and permanently pleasant, as a staid mind and composed spirit; not easily loosned into pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse mirth. For such Jocantrie, while we are in these earthly Tabernacles, is but like the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of men and women in an unswept room, it does but raise a dust and offend the eyes even of the Revellers themselves, what ever it does to the Spectatours. Wherefore what a vain thing were it in me, to ruffle the calme compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of my own Spirit, by perusing and repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of that which proved so great an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grievance to one, to whom I never did, nor yet do, bear the least enmity.</p>
                  <p>I seeing <hi>Mastix</hi> so seriously set against <hi>Mirth,</hi> presently conjectured, for all his smooth speeches, that it might happily fare with him after the usuall manner of other mortalls, who commonly do not wholly quit themselves of their passions, but change them; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did not much mistrust, but that though I could not melt him into a merry temper, yet I might heat him into a fit of Indignation and
<pb facs="tcp:115239:4"/>
naturall sense of Revenge. And to this purpose I set before his eyes the high Insolencies of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius</hi> against the Universities, his unpardonable Incivilities to that Miracle of Ages the noble <hi>Des-Cartes,</hi> besides his outragious Barbaritics up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Mastix</hi> his own self; where I exhibited to his view a whole Catalogue of those honourable Titles he so liberally bestows upon him through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his writings, being so many and so uncouth, that they might stuff out a whole Dictionary with terms of scurrility. These I spread before him, like the bloud of Mulberries before<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants in battel, to provoke his <hi>Irascible.</hi> But to my amazement he seemed to me not at all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but in a carelesse manner made this Answer, The grosser these Revilements are, the Greater Christianity not to be incensed. Besides, if either he or any others by his defamations think worse of me then I deserve, the injury is theirs, not mine; as when one conceives a true Proposition to be false, the Proposition, saith <hi>Epictetus,</hi> is not hurt, but he that is mistaken in it.</p>
                  <p>When I saw these Engines levelled at his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections could make no breach upon him, at last I betook me to more subtil weapons. Well said I, <hi>Mastix,</hi> it should seem you are grown a man of strange Master-dome over your Passions, or at least you are willing to appear so for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; but you have been as great a professor of Reason heretofore. I pray you let me ask you one question; whether do not you think your
<pb facs="tcp:115239:5"/>
                     <hi>Observations</hi> and <hi>Reply</hi> very serviceable for that purpose you intended them, <hi>viz.</hi> for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenancing and quelling of vain <hi>Fantastry</hi> and <hi>Enthusiasme.</hi> Here he putting upon himself a ctosse and unexpected garb of Modesty, told me that it was unfit for him to speak any thing that may seem to tend to the commendation of his own Writings; but smilingly asked me what my opinion was thereof. I professe, said I, I cannot but think them very serviceable for that end, nor can imagine how that Fanatick spirit can be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter met withall, then by slighting and deriding it, there being alwayes so much Pride at the root from whence these Follies and Vanities bloom. For <hi>Fantasticks</hi> and <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> seek nothing more then the admiration of men, wherefore there is no such soveraign Remedy as scorn and neglect, to make them sober. But anxiously to contend in a drie way of Reason with them that professe themselves above it, is indeed to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend below a mans self, and use his sword there where he ought to have shown his whip, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ch was the mistake of the <hi>Scythians</hi> when they fought against their slaves; and therefore it being not so rational to prefer a private humor before a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good, you ought not to be so shie in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I propound. I know not what you mean said <hi>Mastix,</hi> Your late laudable intentions, said I, have been as well against <hi>Enthusiasme</hi> as <hi>Atheisme,</hi> what pretence then have you that those two Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets against <hi>Enthusiasme</hi> may not march in one
<pb facs="tcp:115239:5"/>
body, I mean, be bound up in one Volume with the rest of your Treatises, for they would be then more in view, and consequently do more service. It may be so, said <hi>Mastix,</hi> if they would do any at all. But you do not in the mean time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider what disservice they may do to the rest of my Writings, which are so grave and serious, and how they may cause the Reader, through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitancy, to think me in good earnest no where having once found me so much in jest.</p>
                  <p>Now certainly, <hi>Mastix,</hi> said I, it is not <hi>Gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> but <hi>Melancholy</hi> that makes such a prudent fool of thee. Do not even the godliest and severest men that are, without either sin or scruple, laugh heartily at dinner and tell merry tales, though they begin and end their meal wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h more then ordinary seriousnesse and devotion? Besides, the promiscuous jumbling of those divine Raptures, in your <hi>Reply,</hi> with your usuall merriment there, seems in my judgement far more harsh then the joyning both your Observations and it with the rest of your Discourses.</p>
                  <p>This struck <hi>Mastix</hi> home, as I thought, who a little changing his countenance, after some pause returned this answer. The truth is, said he, that confusion of so great seriousnesse with so humoursome mirth, is the very worst thing in all that book. Which my spirits so ill relish now I am more cool, that I would gladly, if opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity were offered, have my <hi>Reply</hi> distinguished into <hi>Sections</hi> with <hi>Arguments</hi> before every <hi>Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:115239:6"/>
that there may be a due time of Interspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betwixt the ending of the serious and the entring into the merry passages, as well as there was in my writing of them. But this may be done, though these two Pamphlets be still kept apart from the rest in a lesser volume. That's true, said I, but you do not observe that you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the declining of that which is unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. For as sure as your Books will to the Press again after your death, these two, which you would keep out, will croud in with the rest.</p>
                  <p>Here <hi>Mastix</hi> began to scratch his head, and se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It does not at all follow, sayes he. It follows indeed, that it is fit the thing should be done, but it does not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily follow that I do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:115239:6"/>
was to demonstrate that the thing was fit to be done, not questioning but that that being proved, you would not stick to do it your self. Well, said he, my friend <hi>Philophilus,</hi> it is acknowledged then on both sides, that it is fit and requisite to be done, but my self refusing of it, will any body else think you do it? Not any body, said I: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can you do it or no, said <hi>Mastix</hi> to me.</p>
                  <p>Here I began to fumble, but I could not but confesse that I could do it. The whole businesse, said <hi>Mastix,</hi> lies then betwixt you and me. As for my own part I am resolved I will not meddle with it, it being utterly against the present tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of spirit I am in. And a thing so fit to be done in your own judgement, which you can do if you will, and will not be done unlesse by you, must lie at your door as a neglected duty if you refuse it. I marry, said I, friend <hi>Mastix</hi> this is rare indeed, I perceive though you can forego your wonted mirth, you have parted with little of your wit, that you can thus finely catch me in a noose of mine own making. Well, I will not be unwilling to think it my duty for this once, since it can be no otherwise. And I have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der outdone his desire in the prosecuting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                  <p>For I have not onely cast his <hi>Reply,</hi> but his <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations</hi> also into <hi>Sections,</hi> prefixing before each <hi>Section</hi> the <hi>Argument</hi> thereof, in which I might almost equalize my pains to his that first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled the Books, at least I might the fruits of
<pb facs="tcp:115239:7"/>
them; being well assured that they will prove ten times more plain and consequently more pleasant then they were before, especially if thou takest notice of what <hi>Instructions</hi> I shall impart to thee in reference to their perusall.</p>
                  <p>Know therefore that in every <hi>Argument</hi> of the <hi>Sections</hi> of his <hi>Observations,</hi> there is exhibited to thee the <hi>Matter</hi> that <hi>Mastix</hi> speaks to in each <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,</hi> &amp; that so fully and faithfully, that if the Discourse he writes against lay open before thine eyes, it would not make him more intelligible. Now his <hi>Observations</hi> being so punctually num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred and fully understood, it will follow that his <hi>Reply</hi> will be as easie, the same numbring of the Observations being kept there also, so that if thou beest not satisfied in the sense, it is but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving recourse to the Observation, the number does direct thee to in the foregoing Pamphlet, and then all will be clear. The chief light there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for understanding both, being the right framing of the <hi>Arguments</hi> of the <hi>Sections</hi> of his <hi>Observations,</hi> which were so plainly to propose to thy view the <hi>Matter</hi> that is first spoke to, it made me very carefull in contriving thereof. But I was lesse curious in the <hi>Arguments</hi> of the <hi>Sections</hi> of his <hi>Reply,</hi> they being not so much to tell what is <hi>spoke to,</hi> as what is <hi>spoke</hi> in every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Section.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides this dividing his two Pamphlets into <hi>Sections,</hi> I have also prefixed <hi>A Brief Discourse concerning the Nature, Causes, Kindes, and Cure of
<pb facs="tcp:115239:7"/>
Enthusiasme,</hi> where though my pains seem more entirely my own, then in the following Books, yet to confesse ingenuously, they are here farre lesse, I having had more easie and frequent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse to <hi>Mastix</hi> in this so serious and weighty a Matter. After the whole compilement whereof it being reduced to that form thou seest it, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to leave out nothing, in so important a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that was of consequence to be put in; I ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him if it seemed not somthing maimed in the enumeration of the <hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>Enthusiasme,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is nothing set down there concerning the <hi>Devil,</hi> nor the <hi>wilfull wickednesse of the mind</hi> of man; but all is resolved into <hi>Complexion</hi> or the present Temper or Distemper of the body, arising from naturall causes that necessarily act thereupon. For thus this Discourse, said I, may seem as well an <hi>Excuse for,</hi> as a <hi>Discovery of</hi> this disease of <hi>Enthusiasme.</hi> Why, said <hi>Mastix,</hi> I hope it is not your designe, I am sure it is not mine, to incense the mindes of any against <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasts</hi> as to persecute them: all that I aim at, is onely this, that no man may follow them. And your Discourse already, I think, is effectuall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for that purpose, it so plainly discovering that what seems so strange and taking in them, is not from <hi>God,</hi> but a meer <hi>Constitution of body,</hi> the fanaticall workings whereof, though they may be much heightned by some peculiar <hi>Vitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of the mind</hi> or subtile <hi>insinuations of the Devil,</hi> yet because it is not alwayes so, and that it does
<pb facs="tcp:115239:8"/>
very seldome plainly appear that there is any thing more of either <hi>Devil</hi> or <hi>Vitiosity</hi> in the <hi>Enthusiast</hi> then in <hi>others,</hi> saving what his meer <hi>Complexion</hi> leads him to, I think it is, said he, more safe to leave those Considerations out, their causality being more lax and generall then to be appropriated to <hi>Enthusiasme,</hi> and it being farre more laudable in my judgement and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to let the guilty go free, especially in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this nature, then to endanger the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>
                  <p>Thus, Reader, thou seest how thou art be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to <hi>Mastix,</hi> as well for what is judiciously left out, as what is fitly and usefully taken in to the following Discourse. For I must confesse, that in the unridling of this <hi>Riddle</hi> of <hi>Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asme,</hi> I have wholly <hi>plowed</hi> with his <hi>Heifer,</hi> which having told thee, I shall now dismisse thee, being unwilling any longer to detain thee from the <hi>reaping</hi> of the <hi>harvest</hi> of my <hi>Labours.</hi>

HAving undertaken the republishing of the two following Books, and reduced them both under one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Title of <hi>Enthusiasme,</hi> I think it not amisse to speak somewhat by way of Preface, concerning the nature of that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, partly because it may be the better discerned of what good use the Authour's pains are against this distemper of <hi>Fantastrie</hi> and <hi>Enthusiasme,</hi> and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly because by a more punctuall discovery of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, the distemper it self, or at least the ill influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it upon the credulous &amp; inconsiderate, may be prevented. For where the naturall causes of things are laid open, there that stupid reverence and admiration which surprises the ignorant, will assuredly cease.

                     </gap> how it comes to passe that a man should be thus befooled in his own conceit: And truly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse we should offer lesse satisfaction then the thing is capable of, we must not onely treat here of <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,</hi> but of the <hi>Faculties</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> of man, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it may the better be understood how she may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come obnoxious to such disturbances of Melancholy, in which she has quite lost her own judgement and freedome, and can neither keep out nor distinguish betwixt her own fancies and reall truths.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We are therefore to take notice of the severall <hi>Degrees</hi> and <hi>Natures</hi> of the faculties of the <hi>Soul,</hi> the lowest whereof she exercises without so much as any perception of what she does, and these operations are fatall and naturall to her so long as she is in the body, and a man differs in them little from a Plant, which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115239:11"/>
therefore you may call the <hi>Vegetative</hi> or <hi>Plantall</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Soul. The <hi>lowest</hi> of those Faculties of whose present operations we have any perception, are the <hi>outward Senses,</hi> which upon the pertingencie of the Object to the Sensitive Organ cannot fail to act, that is, the Soul cannot fail to be affected there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, nor is it in her power to suspend her perception, or at least, very hardly in her power. From whence it is plain that the Soul is of that nature, that she some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times may awake fatally and necessarily into Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasmes and Perceptions without any will or consent of her own.</p>
                  <p>Which is found true also in <hi>Imagination,</hi> though that Facultie be freer then the former. For what are <hi>Dreams</hi> but the Imaginations and perceptions of one asleep, which notwithstanding steal upon the Soul, or rise out of her without any consent of hers, as is most manifest in such as torment us, and put us to extreme pain till we awake out of them. And the like ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reptions or unavoydable importunities of Thoughts, which offer or force themselves upon the mind, may be observed even in the day time, according to the nature or strength of the complexion of our Bodies; though how the Body doth engage the mind in Thoughts or Imaginations, is most manifest in Sleep. For according as Choler, Sanguine, Phlegme, or Melancholy are predominant, will the Scene of our dreams be, and that without any check or curb of dubitation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the truth and existence of the things that then appear: Of which we can conceive no other reason then this, That the inmost seat of Sense is very fully and vigourously affected, as it is by objects in the day, of whose reall existence the ordinary assurance is, that they so strongly strike or affect our sensitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie; which resides not in the externall Organs, no
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115239:12"/>
more then the Artificers skill in his instruments, but in some more inward Recesses of the brain: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the true and reall seat of Sense being affected in our sleep, as well as when we are awake, 'tis the lesse marvell the Soul conceits her dreams while she is a dreaming, to be no dreams but reall transactions.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Now that the inward sense is so vigoroufly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in these dreams, proceeds, as I conceive, from hence; because the Brains, Animall spirits, or what ever the Soul works upon within, in her imaginative operations, are not considerably moved, altered or agitated from any externall motion, but keep intirely and fully that figuration or modification which the Soul necessarily &amp; naturally moulds them into in our sleep, so that the opinion of the truth of what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented to us in our dreams, is from hence, that Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination then (that is, the inward figuration of our brain or spirits into this or that representation) is far stronger then any motion or agitation from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, which to them that are awake dimmes and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scures their inward imagination, as the light of the Sun doth the light of a candle in a room; and yet in this case also according to <hi>Aristotle</hi> Fancy is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a <hi>kind of sense, though weak.</hi> But if it were so strong as to bear it self against all the occursions and impulses of outward objects, so as not to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but to keep it self entire and in equall splendour and vigour with what is represented from without, and this not arbitrariously but necessarily and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voydably, as has been already intimated, the Party thus affected would not fail to take his own imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a reall object of sense: as it fell out in one that <hi>Cartesius</hi> mentions, (and there are several other exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of that kind) that had his arm cut off, who being hoodwinkt, complained of a pain in this and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115239:12"/>
finger, when he had lost his whole arm. And a further instance may be in mad or Melancholy men, who have confidently affirmed that they have met with the Devil, or conversed with Angels, when it has been nothing but an encounter with their own fancie.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Wherefore it is the enormous strength of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination (which is yet the Soul's weaknesse or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weildinesse whereby she so farre sinks into Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasmes, that she cannot recover her self into the use of her more free faculties of Reason and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) that thus peremptorily engages a man to believe a lie.</p>
                  <p>And if it be so strong as to assure us of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of some externall object which yet is not there, why may it not be as effectuall in the begetting of the belief of some more internall apprehensions, such as have been reported of mad and fanaticall men, who have so firmly and immutably fancied themselves to be <hi>God the Father,</hi> the <hi>Messias,</hi> the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> the <hi>Angel Gabriel,</hi> the <hi>last and chiefest Prophet</hi> that God would send into the world, and the like? For their conceptions are not so pure or immateriall, nor solid or rationall, but that these words to them are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes accompanied with some strong Phantasme or full imagination; the fulnesse and clearnesse whereof, as in the case immediately before named, does natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bear down the Soul into a belief of the truth and existence of what she thus vigorously apprehends; and being so wholly and entirely immersed in this conceit, and so vehemently touched therewith, she has either not the patience to consider any thing alledged against it, or if she do consider and find her self intangled, she will look upon it as a piece of humane sophistry, and prefer her own infallibility or the infallibility of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:115239:13"/>
the Spirit before a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>l <hi>carnall reasonings</hi> whatsoever; As those whose fancies are fortified by long use and education in any absurd point of a false Religion, though wise enough in other things, will firmly hold the conclusion notwithstanding the clearest demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration to the contrary. Now what Custome and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation doth by degrees, distempered Fancy may do in a shorter time. But the case in both is much like that in dreams, where that which is represented is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily taken for true, because nothing stronger enervates the perception. For as the ligation of the outward Organs of Sense keeps off such fluctuations or undulations of motion from without, as might break or obscure these representations in sleep; so prejudice and confidence in a conceit, when a man is awake, keeps his fond imagination vigorous and entire from all the assaults of Reason that would cause any du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it any more wonder that his Intellectualls should be sound in other things, though he be thus delirous in some one point, no more then that he that thinks he sees the devil in a wood, should not be at all mistaken in the circumstance of place, but see the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same path, flowers, and grasse that another in his wits sees there as well as himself.</p>
                  <p>To be short therefore, the Originall of such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptory delusions as mankind are obnoxious to, is the enormous strength and vigour of the Imagination; which Faculty though it be in some sort in our power, as Respiration is, yet it will also work without our leave, as I have already demonstrated, and hence men become mad and fanaticall whether they will or no.</p>

                  <p n="8">8. There are severall Relations in the forenamed Authour concerning the power that nourishment has to work upon imagination, and to change a mans dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position into the nature of that creature whose bloud or milk doth nourish him. A Wench at <hi>Bresla</hi> being struck with an Epilepsie upon the seeing of a Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours head cut off by the Executioner, when severall other remedies failed, was perswaded by some to drink the blood of a Cat, which being done, the wench not long after degenerates into the nature and propertie of that Animal, cries and jumps like a Cat, and hunts mice with like silence and watchfulnesse that they do, pursuing them as close as she could to their very holes. This Narration he transcribes out
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115239:14"/>
of <hi>Weinrichius,</hi> and has another short glance upon another in the same writer, of one that being long fed with swines blood, took a speciall pleasure in wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tumbling himself in the mire: as also of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Girle who being nourished up with Goats milk, would skip like a Goat and brouze on trees as Goats use to do. We might adde a fourth, of one, who by eating the brains of a Bear became of a Bear-like disposition; but we will not insist upon smaller con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>Baptista Porta</hi> drives on the matter much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, professing that he had acquaintance with one that could, when he pleased, so alter the imagination of a man, as he would make him fancie himself to be this or that Bird, Beast, or Fish, and that in this madnesse the party thus deluded would move his body, as near as it was capable, so as such Creatures use to do; and if they were vocall, imitate also their voyce. This intoxicating Potion is made of the extract of certain hearbs, as <hi>Solanum manicum,</hi> Mandrake, and others, together with the heart, brain, and some other parts of this or that Animal, with whose image they would infect the fancie of the party. And he doth affirm of his own experience that trying this feat upon some of his comrades, when he was young, one that had gormundized much beef, upon the taking the potion, strongly imagined himself to be surround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with bulls, that would be ever and anon running upon him with their horns.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. What happens here in these cases where we can trace the Causes, sometimes falls out where we cannot so plainly and directly find out the reason. For Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians take notice of such kind of madnesses as make men confidently conceit themselves to be Doggs, Wolves, and Cats, when they have neither eat the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:115239:15"/>
flesh nor drunk the blood of any Cat, Dog, or Wolf, nor taken any such artificiall potion as we even now spake of to bring them into these diseases. The causes of which cannot be better guessed at then has been by <hi>Sennertus</hi> in that of S. <hi>Vitus</hi> his dance. For as there the body is conceived to be infested by some malignant humour near akin to the poyson of the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantula,</hi> so in these distempers we may well conclude that such fumes or vapours arise into the brain from some foulnesse in the body (though the particular causes we do not understand) as have a very near analogie to the noxious humours or exhalations that move up and down and mount up into the imagination of those that have drunk the bloud of Cats, or have been nourished with the milk of those Animals above named, or taken such intoxicating potions as <hi>Baptista Porta</hi> has described.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. We have given severall instances of that mighty power there is in naturall causes to work upon and unavoidably to change our imagination. We will name something now more generall, whose nature notwithstanding is so various and <hi>Vertumnus</hi>-like, that it will supply the place of almost all particulars, and that is <hi>Melancholy</hi>; of which <hi>Aristotle</hi> gives wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that according to the severall degrees and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers thereof men vary wonderfully in their constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, it making some slow and sottish, others wild, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, and amorous, prone to wrath and lust, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers it makes more eloquent and full of discourse, others it raises up even to madnesse and <hi>Enthusiasme:</hi> and he gives an example of one <hi>Maracus</hi> a Poet of <hi>Syracuse,</hi> who never versified so well as when he was in his distracted fits. But it is most observable in <hi>Melancholy</hi> when it reaches to a disease, that it sets on some one particular absurd imagination upon
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115239:15"/>
the mind so fast, that all the evidence of reason to the contrary cannot remove it, the parties thus affected in other things being as sober and rationall as other men. And this is so notorious and frequent that <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taeus, Sennertus,</hi> and other Physicians define <hi>Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly</hi> from this very effect of it.</p>

An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other he has of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Gentleman of <hi>Limosen</hi> (out of <hi>Anthony Verduer</hi>) who was perswaded he had but one leg, affrighted into that conceit by having that part struck by a wild Boar, otherwise a man well in his wits. A third he hath out of <hi>Platerus,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Countreyman of his, who by chance having fallen into a pit where Frogs and Frogs-spawn was, and having swallowed down a little of the water, was afterward so fully perswaded that there were young frogs in his belly, that for many yeares following he could not rectifie his conceit: He betook himself to the study of Physick for seven yeares together to find a cure for his disease: He travelled also in <hi>Italy, France,</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> to confer with Physicians a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and meeting with <hi>Platerus</hi> consulted him with the rest. He fancied the crying of his guts to be
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115239:16"/>
the croaking of the frogs, and when <hi>Platerus</hi> would have deceived him by putting live frogs into his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements that he might think he had voided them and was cured; his skill in Physick made that trick ineffectuall. For saving this one vain conceit, the man was, as he reports, a learned and prudent man. We will adde onely a fourth out of <hi>Laurentius,</hi> which is of a Nobleman of his time, a man of reason and discretion in all other things, saving that he did conceit himself made of glasse; and though he loved to be visited by his friends, yet had a speciall care that they should not come too near him, for fear they should break him. Not much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to this is that of a Baker of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> that thought he was compos'd of butter, and therefore would not sit in the sun, nor come near a fire for fear he should be melted. It would be an infinite task to set down all at large. <hi>Sennertus</hi> has given some hints of the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this distemper, remitting us to <hi>Schenkius, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus, Donatus, Forestus</hi> and others for more full Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Some, saith he, are vexed and tormented with the fear of death, as thinking they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted some crime they never did commit, some fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy they are eternally damned, nay they complain that they are already tormented with hell fire, others take themselves to be a dying, others imagine themselves quite dead, and therefore will not eat, others fear that the heavens will fall upon them, others dare not clinch their hands for fear of bruising the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their fists, some fancy themselves Cocks, some Nightingales, some one Animal, some another, some entertain conference with God or his Angels, others conceit themselves bewitched or that a black man or Devil perpetually accompanies them, some complain of their poverty, others fancie themselves persons of

honour, Dukes, Princes, Kings, Popes, and what not? Much to this purpose may you see in <hi>Sennertus,</hi> and more in <hi>Democritus junior.</hi>

That which is most observable and most use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the present matter in hand is; That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing there is such an enormous lapse of the fancy aud judgement in some one thing, yet the party should be of a sound mind in all other, according to his naturall capacities and abilities; which all Physicians acknowledge to be true, and are ready to make good by innumerable examples. Which I conceive to be of great moment more thorowly to consider. I do not mean how it may come to passe (for that we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared) but what excellent use it may be of, for to prevent that easie and ordinary Sophisme which imposes upon many, who, if an <hi>Enthusiast</hi> speak elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and it may be rationally and piously (you may be sure zealously and fervently enough and with the greatest confidence can be imagined) are so credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that, because of this visible dresse of such lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble accomplishments, they will believe him even in that which is not onely not probable, but vain and foolish, nay, sometime very mischievous and impious to believe; as, That the party is immediately and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily <hi>inspired of God,</hi> that he is a <hi>speciall Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger</hi> sent by him, the <hi>last and best Prophet,</hi> the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> come in the flesh, and such like stuff as this: which has been ever and anon set on foot in all ages by some Enthusiast or other. Amongst whom I do not deny but there may be some who for the main practicall light of Christianity might have their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as consistent, as those Melancholists above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med had in the ordinary prudentiall affairs of the world, but as for this one particular of being <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally inspired,</hi> of being the <hi>last Prophet, the last

Trumpet, the Angel in the midst of Heaven with the eternall Gospel in his hand, the holy Ghost incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated, God come to judgement,</hi> and the like, this certainly in them, is as true, but farre worse, dotage, then to fancy a mans self either a Cock or Bull, when it is plain to the senses of all that he is a Man.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. But it being of so weighty a concernment I shall not satisfie my self in this more <hi>generall</hi> account of <hi>Enthusiasme,</hi> that it may very well be resolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that property of <hi>Melancholy</hi> whereby men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to be delirous in some one point, their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment standing untouched in others. For I shall. easily further demonstrate that the very nature of Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is such, that it may more fairly and plausibly tempt a man into such conceits of inspiration and superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall light from God, then it can possibly do into those more extravagant conceits of being Glasse, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a Bird, a Beast or any such thing.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. For besides that which is most generall of all, that <hi>Melancholy</hi> enclines a man very strongly and peremptorily to either believe or misbelieve a thing (as is plain in that passion of <hi>Suspicion and Iealousie,</hi> which upon little or no occasion will winne so full as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the mind, that it will engage a man to act as vigorously as if he were certain that his jealousies were true) it is very well known that this Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the most religious complexion that is, and will be as naturally tampering with divine matters (though in no better light then that of her own) as Apes and Monkies will be imitating the actions and manners of men.

by reason of the fury and excesse of it, and that not onely in Actions, but very ordinarily in Eloquence and Expressions; as if here alone were to be had that live sense and understanding of all holy things, or at least as if there were no other state to be paralleld to it.

Which fume mounting into the head, being first actuated and spirited and somewhat refined by the warmth of the heart, fills the mind with variety of imaginations, and so quickens and inlarges invention, that it makes the Enthusiast to admiration fluent and eloquent, he being as it were drunk with new wine drawn from that Cellar of his own that lies in the lowest region of his body, though he be not aware of it, but takes it to be pure Nectar, and those waters of life that spring from above. <hi>Aristotle</hi> makes a long Parallelisme betwixt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and effects of wine and Melancholy, to which both <hi>Fernelius</hi> and <hi>Sennertus</hi> do referre.</p>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115239:19"/>
towards God; but it addes a greater weight of beliefe that there is something supernatural in the business, in that the same complexion discovers it selfe to them that lie under it in such <hi>contrary effects.</hi> For as it is thus vehemently <hi>hot,</hi> so it is as stupidly <hi>cold</hi>; whence the Melancholist becomes faithlesse, hopelesse, heartlesse and almost witlesse. Which <hi>Ebbs</hi> of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution must needs make the <hi>overflowing</hi> of it seem more miraculous and supernatural. But those cold and abject fits of his make him also very sensibly and winningly Rhetorical, when he speaks of disconsola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, desertion, humilitie, mortification, and the like, as if he were truely and voluntarily carried through such things, when as onely the fatal necessity of his complexion has violently drag'd him thorow the meer shadows and resemblances of them. But he finding himselfe afterwards beyond all hope or any sense or presage of any power in himselfe lifted aloft again, he does not doubt that any thing less was the cause of this unexspected joy and triumph, then the immediate arme of God from heaven that has thus exalted him, when it is nothing indeed but a Paroxysme of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly which is like the breaking out of a flame after a long smoaking and reeking of new rubbish laid upon the fire. But because such returnes as these come not at set times, nor make men sick, but rather delight them, they think there is something divine therein, and that it is not from natural causes.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. There is also another notorious Mockery in this Complexion, Nature confidently avouching her self to be God, whom the Apostle calls <hi>Love,</hi> as if it were his very essence; when as indeed it is here no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but Melancholy that has put on the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of an Angel of light. There is nothing more true then that <hi>Love</hi> is the fulfilling of the Law, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115239:19"/>
the highest perfection that is competible to the soul of man; and that this also is so plain and unavoidable, that a man may be in a very high degree mad, and yet not fail to assent unto it. Nay, I dare say, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy it self would be his monitour to reminde him of it, if there were any possibility that he should forget so manifest and palpable a Truth. For the sense of Love at large is eminently comprehended in the temper of the <hi>Melancholist,</hi> Melancholy and wine being of so near a nature one to the other. <gap reason="foreign">

And assuredly it was the fumes of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly that infatuated the fancie of a late new fangled <hi>Religionist,</hi> when he sat so kindly by a Gipsie under an hedge, and put his hand into her bosome in a fit of devotion, and vaunted afterwards of it as if it had been a very pious and meritorious action.</p>

From this complexion are <hi>Poets,</hi> and the more highly pretending <hi>Enthusiasts</hi>: Betwixt whom this is the great difference, that a <hi>Poet</hi> is an <hi>Enthusiast in jest,</hi> and an <hi>Enthusiast</hi> is a <hi>Poet in good earnest</hi>; Melancholy prevailing so much with him, that he takes his no better then Poeticall fits, and figments for divine inspiration and reall truth.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. But that it is a meer naturall flatuous and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritous temper with a proportionable <hi>Dosis</hi> of Sanguine added to their Melancholy, not the pure Spirit of God that thus inacts them; is plainly to be discovered not onely in their language, which is very sweet and melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as if sugar plums lay under their tongue, but from notorious circumstances of their lives. And in my apprehension it will be a sufficient pledge of this truth if we set before our eyes those that have the most highly pretended to the Spirit, and that have had the greatest power to delude the people. For that that pride and tumour of minde whereby they are so confidently carried out to professe, as well as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive so highly of themselves, that no lesse Title must serve their turns, then that of <hi>God, the holy-Ghost,</hi> or <hi>Paraclet, the Messias, the last and chiefest Prophet, the Iudge of the quick and the dead,</hi> and the like; that all this comes from Melancholy is manifest by a lower kind of working of that complexion. For to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115239:20"/>
begin with the first of these Impostours, <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> who gave out that he was <hi>God the father,</hi> he prov'd himself to be but a wretched lecherous man by that inseparable companion of his, <hi>Helena,</hi> whom he called <hi>Selene</hi>; and affirmed to be one of the <hi>Divine powers,</hi> when she was no better then a lewd Strumpet. There was also one <hi>Menander a Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan,</hi> that vaunted himself to be the <hi>Saviour of the world,</hi> a maintainer of the same licentious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure opinions with <hi>Simon. Montanus</hi> professed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> but that it was the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Melancholy that besotted him, his two drabs <hi>Prisca</hi> and <hi>Maximilla</hi> evidently enough declare, who are said to leave their own husbands to follow him. We might adde a third, one <hi>Quintilla,</hi> a woman of no better fame and an intimate acquaintance of the other two, from whence the <hi>Montanists</hi> were also called <hi>Quintillians. Manes</hi> also held himself to be the true <hi>Paraclet,</hi> but lest a sect behind him indoctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in all licentious and filthy principles. <hi>Mahomet</hi> more successefull then any, the last and chiefest Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet that ever came into the world, (if you will believe him) that he was Melancholy, his Epilepticall fits are one argument, and his permission of plurality of wives and concubines, his lascivious descriptions of the joyes of heaven or Paradise, another. But I must confesse I do much doubt whether he took himself to be a Prophet or no; for he seems to me rather a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant witty companion, and shreud Politician, then a meer Enthusiast: and so wise as not to venture his credit or success upon meer conceits of his own, but he builds upon the weightiest principles of the Religion of Jews and Christians: such as, That God is the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour and Governor of the world, That there are An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells and Spirits, That the Soule of man is immortall,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115239:21"/>
and that there is a Judgement and an everlasting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to come after the natural death of the body. So that indeed <hi>Mahometisme</hi> seems but an abuse of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain principles of the doctrine of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> to a political design, and therefore in it selfe far to be preferred before the vain and idle Enthusiasmes of <hi>Dâ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid George</hi>; who yet was so highly conceited of his own light, that he hoped to put <hi>Mahomet's</hi> nose out of joynt, giving out of himselfe that he was the <hi>last and chiefest prophet,</hi> when as lef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He also that is said to insist in his steps, and talks so magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficently of himself, as if he was come to judge both the quick and the dead, by an injudicious distorting and forcing of such plain substantial passages of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as assure us of the existence of Angels and Spirits, and of a life to come, bears his condemnation in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and proclaims to all the world that he is rather a <hi>Priest of Venus</hi> or a meer <hi>Sydereal</hi> Preacher out of the sweetness and powerfulness of his own natural Complexion, then <hi>a true Prophet of God,</hi> or a friend of the mystical Bride-groom <hi>Christ Iesus</hi>; to whose very person as to her Lord and Soveraigne, the Church his spouse, doth owe all reverential love and honour. But such bloated and high swoln Enthusiasts that are so big in the conceit of their own inward worth, have
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:115239:21"/>
little either sense or beliefe of this duty, but fancy themselves either equal or superiour to Christ; Whom notwithstanding God has declared supreme head over men and Angels. And yet they would disthrone him, and set up themselves, though they can show no Title but an unsound kind of popular Eloquence, a Rapso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of sleight and soft words, rowling and streaming Tautologies, which if they at any time bear any true sense with them, it is but what every ordinary Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian knew before; But what they oft insinuate by the by, is a bominably false, as sure as Christianity it self is true. Yet such fopperies as these seem fine things to the heedless and pusillanimous: but surely Christ will raise such a discerning spirit in his Church, that by Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and conviction of Reason, not by force or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal power, such <hi>Mock-prophets</hi> and false <hi>Messias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> as these will be discountenanced and hissed off of the stage; nor will there be a man that knows him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be a <hi>Christian</hi> that will receive them.</p>
                  <p n="22">22, We have I think by a sufficient Induction dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the condition and causes of this mysterious mockery of Enthusiastical love in the highest workings of it, and shown how it is but in effect a natural com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, as very often Religious zeal in general is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to be: As is also observable from the tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous <hi>Anabaptists</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi>: For amongst other things that they contended for, this was not the least, to wit, a freedome to have many wives: So that it should seem that for the most part this religious heat in men, as it arises meerly from nature, is like <hi>Aurum fulminans,</hi> which though it flie upward somewhat, the greatest force when it is fired is found to go down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. This made that religious sect of the <hi>Beguardi</hi> conceit that it was a sin to kiss a woman, but none at all to lie with her. The same furnisht <hi>Carpocrates</hi>

But we have already intimated the neer affinity betwixt Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Wine, which cheers the heart of God and Man, as is said in the Parable. And assuredly Melancholy that lies at first smoaring in the heart and blood, when heat has overcome it (it consisting of such solid parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, which then are put upon motion and agitation) is more strong and vigorous then any thing else that moves in the blood and Spirits, and comes very neer to the nature of the highest <hi>Cordialls</hi> that are.

There are <hi>Three delusions</hi> yet behinde which because they come into my memory I will not omit to speak of, viz. <hi>Mystical interpretations of Scripture, Quakings,</hi> and <hi>Visions,</hi> all which are easily resolved into effects of Melancholy. For as for the first we have already shown that Melancholy as well as Wine, makes a man Rhetoricall or Poetical; and that <hi>Genius</hi> how fancieful it is, and full of allusions and Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors and fine resemblances, every one knows. And what greater matter is there in applying moral and spiritual meanings to the history of the Bible, then to the History of Nature? and there is no Rhetorician nor Poet but does that perpetually. Or how much easier is it to make a story to set out a moral meaning, then
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115239:22"/>
to apply a moral sense to such stories as are already a foot? And for the former <hi>AEsop</hi> was old excellent at it without any suspicion of inspiration, and the later <hi>Sir Francis Bacon</hi> has admirably wel performed in his <hi>Sapientia Veterum,</hi> without any such peculiar or extraordinary illapses of a divine Spirit into him, a business, I dare say, he never dreamt of, and any man that understands him will willingly be his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgatour.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. And for <hi>Quaking,</hi> which deluded soules take to be an infallible sign they are in actuated by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; that it may be onely an effect of their Melancholy is apparent: for none have so high pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions as Melancholists; and that <hi>Fear, Love</hi> or <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> in the height will cause great Trembling, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied. And to these passions none are any thing nigh so obnoxious as those of the Melancholy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, because of the deepness of their resentments and apprehensions. That <hi>Fear</hi> causes trembling there is nothing more obvious, and it is as true of <hi>Love,</hi> which the <hi>Comoedian</hi> had judiciously noted in that passage where <hi>Phaedria</hi> upon the sight of his <hi>Thais,</hi> speaking to <hi>Parmeno, Totus tremo,</hi> say's he, <hi>horreó<expan>

Wherefore it is no wonder the Enthusiast fancying these natural Paroxysms with which he is surprised, to be extraordinary visits of the Deity, and illapses of the holy Ghost into his Soul; which he cannot but then receive; with the highest <hi>Veneration</hi> imaginable; it is no wonder, I say, that <hi>Fear,</hi> and <hi>Ioy,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> should make such a confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his spirits, as to put him into a fit of trembling and quaking. In which case the fervour of his spirits and heat of imagination may be wrought-up to that pitch that it may amount to a perfect Epilepsie, as it often happens in that sect they call <hi>Quakers,</hi> who undoubtedly are the most <hi>Melancholy Sect</hi> that ever was yet in the world.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. Now that Melancholy disposes a man to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poplexies and Epilepsies is acknowledged both by Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers and Physicians. For what is <hi>Narcotical</hi> and deads the motion of the Spirits, if it be highly such, proves also <hi>Apoplectical.</hi> Besides grosse vapours stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the <hi>Arteriae Carotides</hi> and <hi>Plexus Coroides,</hi> and so hindring the recourse and supply of Spirits, may doe the same. Some would illustrate the matter from the fumes of Charcoale; that has often made men fall down dead. But take any or all of these, Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is as like to afford such noxious vapours as any other temper whatsoever. And that an <hi>Epilepsie</hi> may arise from such like causes, these two diseases be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so neer a kin, as <hi>Galen</hi> writes, is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable; and that the morbifick matter is, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="27">27. But in both these there being a ligation of the outward senses, what ever is then represented to the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115239:23"/>
mind is of the nature of a dream. But these fits being not so ordinary as our naturall sleep, these dreams the praecipitant and unskilfull are forward to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit to be Representations extraordinary and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, which they call <hi>Revelations</hi> or <hi>Visions,</hi> of which there can be no certainty at all no more then of a Dream.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. The mention of <hi>Dreams</hi> puts me in mind of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Melancholy Symptome, which Physitians call <hi>Extasie,</hi> which is nothing else but <hi>Somnus praeter naturam profundus,</hi> the causes whereof are none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then those of natural sleep, but more intense and excessive; the effect is the deliration of the party after he awakes; for he takes his dreams for true Histories and real Transactions. The reason whereof, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, is the extraordinary clearness and fulness of the representations in his sleep, arising from a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect privation of all communion with this outward world, and so there being no interfareings or cross-strokes of motion from his body so deeply overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and bedeaded with sleep, what the imagination then puts forth of her self, is as clear as broad day, and the perception of the soul is at least as strong and vigorous as it is at any time in beholding things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, and therefore Memory as thoroughly sealed therewith, as from the sense of any external Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. The vigour and clearness of these Visions dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from those in ordinary sleep, as much as the liveliness of the images let in artificially into a dark room accurately darkned from those in one carelesly made dark, some chinks or crevises letting in light, where they should not. But strength of perception is no sure ground of truth: And such visions as these let them be never so clear, yet they are still in the nature of dreams. And he that regardeth dreams is like him
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:115239:24"/>
that catcheth at a shadow, or followeth after the wind, as <hi>Syracides</hi> speaks.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. Whether it be in any mans power to fall into these <hi>Epilepsies, Apoplexies,</hi> or <hi>Extasies</hi> when he pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, is neither an useless nor a desperate question: For we may find a probable solution from what has been already intimated; for the <hi>Enthusiast</hi> in one of his Melancholy intoxications (which he may accelerate by solemn silence and intense and earnest meditation) finding himself therein so much beyond himselfe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits it a sensible presence of God, and a supernatural manifestation of the Divinity, which must needs raise that passion of Veneration, and most powerful Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which consists of Love, Fear, and Joy, which single passions have been able to kill men or cast them into a trance, how can they then (if they be well fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by imagination and desire in the Enthusiast of a neerer union with this inward Light) fail to cast him into Tremblings, Convulsions, Apoplexies, Extasies, and what not; Melancholy being so easily changeable into these symtomes? And it is very probable that this may be the condition of some of those they call <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers.</hi> But for S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Austins</hi> African Presbyter (who was named <hi>Restitutus</hi>) who by a lamenting voice or mournful tone would be cast into such an Extasie, he is found alone in that, and is hardly imitable, it arising from some proper &amp; peculiar constitution of his own. That <hi>Cardan</hi> and <hi>Facius</hi> his Father could cast them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves when they would into an Extasie, I can as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily believe as that the <hi>Laplanders</hi> could, and doe in my own judgment refer them both to one cause, which <hi>Sennertus</hi> notes that <hi>Cardan</hi> somewhere does intimate concerning his Father, that he had <gap reason="foreign">

I doe not so much aim at as that which is <hi>Natural.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for those <hi>Visions</hi> that Enthusiasts see wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we have already referred their causes to that strength of Imagination in a Melancholy Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. And for that fervour of minde whereby they are carried out so confidently to foretell things to come, that there is nothing supernatural in it may be evidenced in that either some probable grounds, that ordinary prudence may discover, might move them to think this or that, the vehemency of their own Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly adding that confidence to their presage as if God himself had set it upon his Spirit; or else in that they most frequently presage false, and therefore when they foretell true, it is justly imputed to chance. As a man that dreams a nights, it is a hard case if in so many years dreams he light not on some <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="31">31. And yet notwithstanding humbly conceive that there may be such a presage in the spirit of a man that is to act in things of very high concernment to himselfe or to the publick, as may be a sure guide to him, especially if he continue sincerely devout and pious. For it is not at all improbable but such as act in very publick affairs in which Providence has a more special hand, that these agents driving on her design may have a more special assistance and animation from her. Of which, as others have not the sense, so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they imagine the manner of it. And this is the case, I thinke, wherein that of <hi>Syracides</hi> may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified,

                     <hi>That a mans own heart will tell him more then seven watchmen on an high Tower.</hi> But this is Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasme in the better sense, and therefore not so proper for our discourse who speak not of that which is true, but of that which is a mistake; the <hi>Causes</hi> whereof we having so fully laid down, we will now consider the <hi>Kindes</hi> of it, bur briefly and onely so far forth as suits with our present purpose and design.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore setting aside all accuracie, we shall content our selves to distribute it from the condition of the Persons in which it resides, into <hi>Political</hi> and <hi>Philosophical.</hi> For Enthusiasme most-what works according to the <hi>natural Genius</hi> of the party it doth surprise.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. Wherefore those whose temper carries them most to Political affaires, who love rule and honour and have a strong sense of civil rights, Melancholy heating them makes them sometimes fancy themselves great Princes (at least by divine assignment) &amp; deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the people sent from God, such as were in likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood the false <hi>Messiasses</hi> that deceived the people of the Jews, as <hi>Theudas</hi> and that <hi>AEgyptian Impostor,</hi> also <hi>Barcocab, Ionathas, Dositheus</hi> and several others, who it's likely, it being the common fame amongst the Jews that the <hi>Messias</hi> the deliverer was about that time to come, according to the heat and forwardness of their own Melancholy, conceited themselves to be him. Which is the easier to believe, there being seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral instances in History of those that have fancyed themselves Monarchs, Popes, and Emperours, when as yet they have been but Foot-boys, Grooms, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-men. Whether there might not be as much of Villany as Melancholy in some of these false <hi>Messias<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> if it be suspected, it will be hard to take off the suspicion. But there was a <hi>German</hi> in whom we may
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115239:25"/>
more safely instance not many yeers ago here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that stiled himselfe <hi>a Warrior of God, David the second,</hi> who in deep compassion of the sufferings of his Countrey would very fain have got some few for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces here in <hi>England</hi> to carry over; with which he was confident he could have silenced the enemy and setled all <hi>Germany</hi> in peace. The man seemed to be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry religious man, and a great hater of Tyranny and oppression, and very well in his wits to other things, onely he was troubled with this infirmity that he fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyed himfelfe that <hi>David</hi> the Prophets foretell of, who should be that peaceable Prince and great Deliverer of the Jews. He published a short writing of his which I had the opportunity of seeing, which was full of zeal and Scripture-eloquence: I saw his person in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> if he that showed me him was not mistaken. He was a tal proper man, of a good age, but of a very pale wasted melancholy countenance. Another also of later yeers I had the hap to meet withall, whose dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course was not onely rational but pious, and he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have his wits very well about him, nor could I discover the least intimation to the contrary, onely he had this flaw that he conceited that he was by God appointed to be that fifth Monarch of which there is so much noise in this age, which imagination had so possessed him, that he would sometime have his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to serve him all in plate, and upon the knee, as a very learned and religious friend of mine told me af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. Wherefore I do not look upon this man as so sober as the former, nor on either as comparable to that <hi>David</hi> that was born at <hi>Delph,</hi> lived first in low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>Germany</hi> with those of his sect, after came to <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil, Anno</hi> 1544. and there dyed, 1556. and was dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged up again, 1559. Wherein his prophecy of himselfe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:115239:26"/>
was in an ill-favoured manner fulfilled, who to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the fluctuating minds of his followers, whom he would have perswaded that he was immortall, told them at his death, that he should rise again within three yeares, presaging that of himself that he denied would ever come to passe in any one else.</p>
                  <p n="34">34 This <hi>David George</hi> a man of very low paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, was yet in the judgement of his very enemies, one of notable naturall parts, a comely person to look upon, and of a gracefull presence.

He lived very splendidly and magnificently in his house, and yet without the least stir or disorder. He was a religious frequenter of the Church, a liberall reliever of the poor, a comfortable visiter of the sick, obedient to the Magistrate, kind and affable to all persons, discreet in all things, very cunning in some, as in his closenesse and reservednesse in his Doctrine to those of <hi>Basil,</hi> where he liv'd, to whom he communicated not one <hi>Iota</hi> of it, but yet he sedulously dispersed it in the further parts of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> both by books and letters, the main heads whereof you shall hear as follows.</p>

                     <item>1. That the doctrine hitherto delivered by Moses, the Prophets, Christ himself, and his Apostles, is maimed and imperfect, published onely to keep men in a childish obedience for a time, till the fulnesse and perfection of <hi>David George</hi> his Doctrine should be communicated to the world, which is the onely do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that can make man-kind happy, and replenish them with the knowledge of God.</item>
                     <item>2. That <hi>David George</hi> is the <hi>true Christ</hi> and

                        <hi>Messias,</hi> the dear Son of God, born not of the flesh but of the holy Ghost and Spirit of Christ, which God had reserved in a secret place, his body being reduced to nothing, and has infused it wholly into the soul of <hi>David George.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. That this <hi>David</hi> the Messias is to restore the house of Israel, and reerect the Tabernacle of God, not by the crosse, afflictions and death, as the other Messias; but by that sweetnesse and love and grace that is given to him of his Father.</item>
                     <item>4. That the power of remission of sins is given to this <hi>David George,</hi> and that it is he that is now come to judge the world with the last judgement.</item>
                     <item>5. That the holy Scriptures, the sayings and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of the Prophets, of Christ and of his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles do all point, if rightly understood in the true mystery of them, to the glorious coming of <hi>David George,</hi> who is greater then Christ himself, as being born of the spirit and not of the flesh.</item>
                     <item>6. That all sin and blasphemy against the Father or the Sonne may be remitted or pardoned, but the sin against the holy Ghost, that is, against <hi>David George,</hi> is never to be remitted.</item>
                     <item>7. That the resurrection of Christ out of the grave, and the resurrection of the dead is a meer mysterie or Allegorie.</item>
                     <item>8. That Angels and Devils are onely good men and evil men, or their Virtues and Vices.</item>
                     <item>9. That Matrimony is free, no obligation, and that no man thereby is confined to one woman; but that procreation of children shall be promiscuous or in common to all those that are born again or regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the spirit of <hi>David George.</hi>

                  <p>These things are recorded in the Life and Doctrine of <hi>David George,</hi> published by the Rector and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of <hi>Basil</hi> 1559.</p>

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115239:28"/>
of a life to come and existence of Angels or Spirits, and his allowing of plurality or community of wives. The former whereof I must confesse I cannot so much impute to any thing as to a more luscious and fulsome mixture of Sanguine in his Enthusiastick complexion. For nothing will so slake a mans desires, or dead his belief of that more spiritual and immaterial state and condition, as this sweet glut of blood that so thickens and clouds the Spirits, that the mind cannot imagine or presage any thing beyond the present concernment of this mortal Body. And of the latter I think it is acknowledged by all, that no such genuine cause can be assigned as this same complexion of Sanguine that disposes men so strongly to the love of women.</p>
                  <p n="39">39 Wherefore this Enthusiast being overborne by the power of his own constitution into the misbeliefe of those great promises of Eternal life, set forth in the Scripture, took the holy writers thereof either to be mistaken, or onely to have intended Allegories by what they writ; and that fervour that he found in himself to love, and peace, and equity and the like, boyling so high as to the driving of him into a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion that he was inspired, he conceited his misbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of those precious promises of Immortality and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the heavens, a special piece of illumination al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so; and the resurrection of the dead to be nothing else but to be raised into a like ardency towards such things with himselfe, and to a like misbelief with him of that celestial crown the Apostle speaks of. And therefore he not being able to raise his minde by faith to heaven, he brought heaven to earth in his vain ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination: Which was lesse pains then <hi>Mahomet</hi> took, who was fain to walk to the mountain, when he saw the mountain would not move to him.</p>

In like manner those inspired Melancholists stuff their heads and writings with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry flaring fancy that Melancholy suggests to them, as if it were a precious Truth bestowed upon them by the holy Spirit, and with a devotional reverence they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the unexpected Paroxysmes of their own natural distemper, as if it were the power and presence of God himself in their Souls.</p>

second from the firmament, and <hi>Mercury</hi> the second from the Earth. <hi>Saturn</hi> is the first from the heaven, and <hi>Luna</hi> the first from the Earth. <hi>Sol</hi> mixeth it self with all, but is never bettered by his Inferiours. Now know that there is a great agreement betwixt <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Lead,</hi> and <hi>Luna</hi> or <hi>Silver, Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Mercury, Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> because in the midst of these <hi>Sol</hi> is placed. What can it be but the heaving of the Hypochondria that lifts up the mind to such high comparisons from a supposition so false and foolish? But I have observed generally of <hi>Chymists</hi> and <hi>Theosophists,</hi> as of severall other men more pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably mad, that their thoughts are carryed much to <hi>Astrology,</hi> it being a fancyfull study built upon very sleight grounds, and indeed I do not question, but a relique of the ancient superstition and Idolatry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the rude Heathens, which either their own Melancholy, or something worse, instructed them in.</p>

                  <p>That the absence of the Sun is not the cause of night, for as much as his light is so great that it may illuminate the earth all over at once as clear as broad day, but that Night is brought on by the influence of <hi>dark Starres</hi> that raye out darknesse and obscurity upon the earth, as the Sun does light.</p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Gnomi, Nymphae, Lemures</hi> and <hi>Penates,</hi> Spirits endued with understanding as much or more then Men, are yet wholly mortall, not having so much as an immortall soul in them.</p>
                  <p>That the Starres are as it were the Phials, or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curbits, in which the Meteoricall <hi>Sal.

                  <p>That the Starres are as it were the pots in which the <hi>Archeus</hi> or heavenly <hi>Vulcan</hi> prepares pluvious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which exhaled from thence first appears in the form of clouds, after condenses to rain.</p>

                  <p>That the reason of Divination is this, That a man has a sydereall body besides this terrestriall which is joyned with the Starres; and so when this sydereall body is more free from the Elements, as in sleep, this body and the Starres confabulating together, the mind is informed of things to come.</p>
                  <p>That the Starres are struck with a terrour or hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of the approach of any mans death, whence it is that no man dies without some sign or notice from them, as the <hi>dances of dead men,</hi> some <hi>noise in the house</hi> or the like.</p>
                  <p>That as by a divine faith the dead are raised and mountains cast into the midst of the Sea, so by the faith of nature the influence of the Starres, who know all the secrets of nature, is to be commanded,

For I appeal to any man, what is nearer to ancient <hi>Paganisme</hi> then what this bold wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has uttered concerning the Starres? or what San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary so safe for the Atheist that derides and eludes all Religion, then such a miraculous influence of the heavens as <hi>Paracelsus</hi> describes in his <hi>Scientia Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomica?</hi> Wherefore I should be very much amazed at the Madnesse and Inconsistency of him and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, who have ever and anon a fling against Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philosophy, when themselves take into their writings the very dregs of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the grosse princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the ancient Pagan superstition and Idolatry, did I not remember that they are <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low not the guidance of Reason, but the strength of Fancy.</p>

                  <p>This taken in the coursest sense, I make no questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but it was the grand Principle from whence did flow so many varieties and impurities of the Pagan superstition, they fancying they met God in every object of their senses; and our exorbitant <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> professe, That every thing is God in love or wrath: Which, if I understand any thing, is no better then <hi>Atheisme.</hi> For it implies that God is nothing else but the <hi>Vniversall Matter</hi> of the world, dressed up in severall shapes and forms, in sundry properties and qualities; some gratefull, some ungratefull; some holy, some profane; some wise, some senselesse; some weak, some strong, and the like. But to slice God into so many parts is to wound him and kill him, and to make no God at all.</p>
                  <p n="48">48. Again, how does <hi>Paracelsus</hi> justifie the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens worshipping the Starres, he making them such knowing, powerfull, and compassionate spectatours of humane affairs! And why might they not pray to them as <hi>Anne Bodenham</hi> the Witch did to the Planet <hi>Iupiter</hi> for the curing diseases, if they have so much power and knowledge as to generate men here below, and conferre gifts upon them? For it would be no more then asking a mans Father or Godfather bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing. For if it be admitted that any one nation is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got by the Starres, the Atheist will assuredly assume that they are all so. Moreover how shall we repair the losse (and damage done to the authority of our blessed Saviour his miracles? whereby not onely Christianitie, but the first Fundamentalls of all true Religion are eminently established, <hi>viz.</hi> the discovery of a Speciall and Particular Providence of God; and an hope of a Life to come. For if the Starres can make such living creatures of prepared matter that
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:115239:34"/>
have sense and understanding, which yet have no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal souls, but wholy return into dead mater again, why is it not so with men as well as them? And if they can contribute the power of such wonder-working wisdome as was in <hi>Moses</hi> and in <hi>Christ,</hi> or what is so very nigh to it, what footsteps does there remain of proof that there is any God or Spirits? For all is thus resolvable into the power of the stars. A thing that that zealous and industrious Atheist <hi>Caesar Vaninus</hi> triumphs in exceedingly in his <hi>Amphitheatrum aeternae Providentiae</hi>: Where he cites several Astrological pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages out of <hi>Cardan</hi> under pretence to refute them, in which he fetches the original of those three eminent Law-givers, <hi>Moses, Christ,</hi> and <hi>Mahomet,</hi> from the influence of the stars. The law of <hi>Moses</hi> is from <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,</hi> saies <hi>Cardan,</hi> that of <hi>Christ</hi> from <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> that of <hi>Mahomet</hi> from <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Mars:</hi> The Law of the Idolaters from the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Mars.</hi> And in another place <hi>Cardan</hi> imputes that sweetness, and meeknesse, and wisdome, and eloquence that was in our Saviour, whereby he was able to dispute in the Temple at twelve yeers of age, to the influence of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter. Pomponatius</hi> also acknowledges the wisdome and miracles of <hi>Christ,</hi> but refers all to the starrs, a man as far laps't into Atheisme, I conceive, as <hi>Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> himselfe; so that these wilde fancies of the Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasts are in truth the chiefe Props or Shelters that Atheists uphold or defend themselves by. But how fancieful and confounded an account there is of Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, let any man that has patience as well as sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of reason, judge.</p>
                  <p n="49">49. I do not speak these things as if I thought ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Paracelsus</hi> or his followers thus Atheistical, but to shew their Phantastrie and Enthusiasme, they so hotly pretending to matters of Christianity and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115239:35"/>
and yet handling them so grosly and indiscreetly, blurting out any garish foolery that comes into their mind, though it be quite contrary to the Analogie of Faith, nor has any shew of ground in solid Reason, onely to make themselves to be stared upon and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred at by the world. But the event of it is, that as some admire them, so others execrate them, as men of an impious and diabolical spirit. Which I confesse I think too harsh a censure, well meaning men being lyable to Melancholy and Lunacies as well as to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues and burning Feavers. Yet a man should be so far off from thinking the better of any discovery of Truth by an Enthusiastick spirit, that he should rather for that very cause suspect it, because that temper that makes men Enthusiastical is the greatest enemy to Reason, it being more thick and muddy, and therefore once heated intoxicates them like wine in the must, and is more likely to fill their brains full of odde fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies then with any true notions of Philosophy. But men of a purer blood, and finer spirits, are not so ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to this distemper: For this is the most natural seat of sublimer Reason; when as that more mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical kind of <hi>Genius</hi> that loves to be tumbling of and trying tricks with the matter (which they call making experiments) when desire of knowledge has so heated it that it takes upon it to become <hi>Architectonical</hi> and flie above its sphere, it commits the wildest hallucina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions imaginable, that material or corporeal fancie egregiously fumbling in more subtile and spiritual spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations. This is that that commonly makes the <hi>Chymist</hi> so pitiful a <hi>Philosopher,</hi> who from the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row inspection of some few toys in his own art, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives himself able to give a reason of all things in <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi>; as ridiculous a project, in my judgment, as that of his that finding a piece of a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115239:35"/>
oar on the sand, busied his brains above all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to contrive it into an entire ship.</p>
                  <p n="50">50. What I have hitherto spoken, I would have so understood as coming from one that neither contemns the well-meaning of the <hi>Theosophist,</hi> or disallows of the industry of the <hi>Chymist,</hi> but I shall ever excuse my selfe from giving any credit to either, any further then some lusty miracle, transcendent medicine, or solid Reason shall extort from me.</p>
                  <p n="51">51. We have spoken of the <hi>kindes</hi> of <hi>Enthusiasme</hi> so far as we held it serviceable for our design, we shall now touch upon the <hi>Cure</hi> of this <hi>Disease.</hi> Where waving all pretense to the knowledge of Physick or acquaintance with the Apothecaries shop, we shall set down onely such things as fall under a moral or Theological consideration, giving onely instructions for the guidance of a mans life in reference to this grand errour of Enthusiasme: which a sober man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well determine whether it be more ridiculous, or deplorable and mischievous. Now the most soveraign medicine that I know against it, is this <hi>Diatrion</hi> or <hi>Composition</hi> of <hi>Three</hi> excellent <hi>Ingredients,</hi> to wit, <hi>Temperance, Humility,</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> which as I doe not despair but that it may recover those that are somewhat farre gone in this Enthusiastick distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, so I am confident, that it will not fail to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it in them that are not as yet considerably smitten.</p>
                  <p n="52">52. By <hi>Temperance</hi> I understand a measurable Abstinence from all hot or heightning meats or drinks, as also from all venereous pleasures, and tactual delights of the body, from all softnesse and effeminacy, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and peremptory adhesion to the perfectest degree of chastity in the single life, and of Continency in wedlock, that can be attain'd to. For it is plain in
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115239:36"/>
sundry examples of Enthusiasme above named, that the more hidden and lurking fumes of lust had tainted the fancies of those Pretenders to <hi>Prophecy</hi> and <hi>Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> We will adde also to these, moderate exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Body, and seasonable taking of the fresh aire, a due and discreet use of Devotion, whereby the Blood is ventilated and purged from dark oppressing vapors; Which a temperate dyet, if not fasting, must also accompany; or else the more hot and zealous our addresses are, the more likely they are to bring mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief upon our own heads, they raising the feculency of our intemperance into those more precious parts of the Body the Brains, and animal Spirits, and so intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the mind with fury and wildnesse.</p>
                  <p n="53">53. By <hi>Humility</hi> I understand an entire Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the will of God in all things, a Deadness to all self-excellency and preheminency before others, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Privation of all desire of singularity or attracting of the eyes of men upon a mans own person: As little to relish a mans own praise or glory in the world, as if he had never been born into it; but to be wholly contented with this one thing, that his will is a subduing to the will of God, and that with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse and reverence he doth receive what ever Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence brings upon him; be it sweet or sour, with the hair or against it, it is all one to him, for what he cannot avoid it is the gift of God to the world in order to a greater good. But here I must confesse, That he that is thus affected, as he seeks no knowledge to please himselfe, so he cannot avoid being the most knowing man that is. For he is surrounded with the beams of Divine wisdome as the low depressed Earth with the raies of the stars his deeply and profoundly humbled soul being as it were the Center of all hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly illuminations, as this little globe of the Earth is
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115239:36"/>
of those celestial influences. I professe I stand amazed while I consider the ineffable advantages of a mind thus submitted to the Divine will, how calm, how comprehensive, how quick and sensible she is, how free, how sagacious, of how tender a touch and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment she is in all things. When as pride and strong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire ruffles the mind into uneven waves and boisterous fluctuations, that the aeteranl light of Reason concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Life,</hi> cannot imprint its perfect and distinct image or character there; nor can so subtile and delicate motions and impressions be sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the understanding disturbed and agitated in so violent a storm. That man therefore who has got this <hi>Humble frame of Spirit,</hi> which is of so mighty concernment for acquiring all manner of wisdome as well <hi>Natural</hi> as <hi>Divine,</hi> cannot possibly be so foolish as to be mistaken in that which is the genuine result of a contrary temper, and such is that of <hi>Enthusiasme,</hi> that puffs up men into an opinion that they have a more then ordinary influence from God that acts upon their Spirits, and that he designes them by special appointment to be <hi>new Prophets<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="54">54. By <hi>Reason</hi> I understand so setled and cautious a Composure of mind, as will suspect every high flown and forward fancy that endevours to carry away the assent before deliberate examination; she not endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be gulled by the vigour or garishnesse of the representation, nor at all to be born down by the weight or strength of it; but patiently to trie it by the known Faculties of the Soul, which are either the <hi>Common notions</hi> that all men in their wits agree upon, or the <hi>Evidence of outward Sense,</hi> or else a <hi>cleer and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115239:37"/>
distinct Deduction from these.</hi> What ever is not agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to these three, is <hi>Fancy,</hi> which testifies nothing of the <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Existence</hi> of any thing, and therefore ought not, nor cannot be assented to by any but mad men or fools. And those that talk so loud of that high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Principle <hi>the Spirit</hi> with exclusion of these, betray their own ignorance, and while they would by their wilde Rhetorick disswade men from the use of their Rational faculties under pretence of expectation of an higher and more glorious Light, do as madly, in my mind, as if, a company of men travailing by night with links, torches and lanthorns, some furious Orator amongst them should by his wonderful strains of Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence so befool them into a misconceit of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent condition, comparing of it with the sweet and cheerful splendor of the day, that they should through impatience and indignation beat out their links, and torches and break a pieces their lanthorns against the ground, and so chuse rather to foot it in the dark with hazard of knocking their noses against the next Tree they meet, and tumbling into the next ditch, then to continue the use of those convenient lights that they had in their sober temper prepared for the safety of their journey. But the <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> mistake is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in leaving his present guide before he has a better, but in having a false notion of him he does expect. For assuredly that <hi>Spirit of illumination,</hi> which resides in the soules of the faithful is a Principle of the purest Reason that is communicable to the humane Nature. And what this Spirit has, he has from Christ (as Christ himselfe witnesseth) who is the eternal <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> the all-comprehending Wisdome and Reason of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he sees through the natures and Ideas of all things with all their respects of Dependency and Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, Congruity and Incongruity, or what ever ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitude
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115239:37"/>
they have one to another, with one continued glance at once. And what ever of <hi>Intellectual light</hi> is communicated to us is derived from hence, and is in us <hi>Particular Reason,</hi> or <hi>Reason in Succession, or by peece-meal.</hi> Nor is there any thing the holy Spirit did ever suggest to any man but it was agreeable to, if not demonstrable from, what we call <hi>Reason.</hi> And to be thus perswaded, how powerful a Curb it will be upon the exorbitant impressions and motions of Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Enthusiasme, I leave it to any man to judge.</p>
                  <p n="55">55. To these three notable and more generall Helps, we might adde some particular Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whereby we may keep off this <hi>Enthusiastical</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacity from our selves, or discover it when it has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hold upon others. As for example; If any man shall pretend to the discovery of a Truth by inspirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is of no good use or consequence to the Church of God, it is to me little less then a Demonstration, that he is <hi>Fanatical.</hi> If he heaps up Falshoods as well as Truths, and pretends to be inspired in all, it is to me an evidence he is inspired in none of those my ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he offers to the world.</p>
                  <p n="56">56. There are certain advantages also that <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasts</hi> have, which are to be taken notice of, whereby they have imposed upon many; as, That they have spoken very <hi>raisedly</hi> and <hi>divinely,</hi> which most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly has happened to sundry persons a little before they have grown stark mad; and that they may hit of something extraordinary is no pledge of the truth of the rest. For this unquiet and tumultuous spirit of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy shaking their whole bodily frame, is like an Earth-quake to one in a dungeon, which for a small moment makes the very walls gape and cleave, and so lets in light for a while at those chinks; but all closes up again suddenly, and the prisoner is confined to his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:115239:38"/>
wonted darknesse; This therefore was a Chance in nature, not a gratious visit of the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p n="57">57. Hereunto you may also joyn the luck of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, be it sleeping or waking; for such things have happened to mad men and fools, and <hi>Aristotle</hi> offers at a pretty reason that may reach both. <gap reason="foreign">

That Prophesie may arise from on this side of the pure and infallible Deity, and it is our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake that we think that what predictions fall out true, are certainly foreknown by the Foreteller. For the present conspiracy of causes that shoot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the vacant mind may corrupt and alter, and be blown away like clouds, that at first seem to assure the husbandman of a following rain.</p>
                  <p n="58">58. But there is yet a stronger allurement then Prophecy to draw on belief to the <hi>Enthusiast,</hi> which is a semblance of doing some miracle, as the curing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115239:38"/>
some desperate disease; as it happened very lately in this Nation. For it is very credibly reported, and I think cannot be denied, That one by the stroaking of a mans arm that was dead and uselesse to him, recovered it to life and strength. When I heard of it, and read some few pages of that miraculous Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians writing, my Judgement was that the cure was naturall, but that his blood and spirits were boyled to that height that it would hazard his brain, which proved true; for he was stark mad not very long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. There may be very well a healing and sanative Contagion as well as morbid and venemous. And the Spirits of Melancholy men being more massy, and ponderous, when they are so highly refined and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by a more then ordinary heat and vigour of the body, may prove a very powerfull <hi>Elixir,</hi> Nature having outdone the usuall pretenses of Chymistrie in this case.</p>
                  <p n="59">59. Whatever credit the <hi>Enthusiast</hi> may conciliate to himself from his moving Eloquence, his mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous style and unexpected notions, they are easily to be resolved into that principle of Melancholy above named, the sense of which complexion is so deep and vigorous, that it cannot fail to inable the Tongue to tell her story with a great deal of life and affection; and the imagination is so extravagant that it is farre easier for her to ramble abroad and fetch in some odde skue conceit from a remote obscure corner, then to think of what is nearer and more ordinarily intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But these things are so fully and plainly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in those Generall causes of <hi>Enthusiasme</hi> we have already declared, besides what we have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly touched upon before, that it will not be worth our labour to insist any longer upon them. When we have satisfied a Scruple or two concerning
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:115239:39"/>
what we have said of <hi>Melancholy</hi> and <hi>Enthusiasme,</hi> I think we shall have omitted nothing materially per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to this present Speculation.</p>
                  <p n="60">60. And the first is, How we can distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Melancholy,</hi> we having attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted so notable effects thereunto. The second is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have not reviled and vilified all <hi>Enthusiasme</hi> whatsoever, and invited men to a cold <hi>Pharisaicall</hi> stupidity and acting, merely according to an outward letter without an inward testimony of life.</p>
                  <p>The meaning of the first scruple must be restrain'd to such things as in their externals are laudable and approveable, <hi>viz.</hi> whether <hi>such as they,</hi> be out of a <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Naturall</hi> principle, whether from <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Complexion.</hi> For in those things that are at their very first view discerned to be culpable, it is plain that they are not from God. I answer therefore, That there are three main discriminations betwixt the <hi>Spirit</hi> and the most <hi>Specious Complexion.</hi> The first is, That that Piety or Goodnesse which is from the Spirit of God is universall, extirpating every vice and omitting nothing that is truely a divine virtue. The second is, A belief of those Holy Oracles comprehended in the Old and New Testament, they being rightly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, and particularly, of that Article, That <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> even he that died on the crosse at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> betwixt two thieves, is the <hi>Sonne of God,</hi> and <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne of men and Angels,</hi> and that he in his own person shall come again to judge the quick and the dead. The third and last is, An universall Prudence, whereby a man admits nor acts nothing, but what is solidly rationall at the bottome, and of which he can give a good account, let the successe be what it will. He that finds himself thus affected, may be sure it is the Spirit of God, not the power of Complexion or
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:115239:39"/>
Nature that rules in him. But this man to others, if they be unbelieving and so rude and unprepared as not to be capable of Reason, he is nothing to them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he can do a miracle. How vain then is the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiast</hi> that is destitute of both? But those ancient Records of miracles done in the behalf of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are a sufficient Testimony of the truth of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to those whose hearts are rightly fitted for it.</p>
                  <p n="61">61. To the Second scruple I answer, That there has not one word all this time been spoken against that true and warrantable Enthusiasme of devout and holy souls, who are so strangely transported in that vehement love they bear towards God, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expressible Joy and Peace they find in him. For they are modest enough and sober in all this, they witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing no other thing to the world then what others may experience in themselves, and what is plainly set down in the holy Scriptures, That the kingdome of God is Righteousnesse and Peace and Joy in the Holy-Ghost. But in none of these things do they pretend to equallize themselves to Christ, whom God has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above men and Angels, but do professe the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of his Spirit in them to the praise and glory of God, and the comfort and incouragement of their drooping Neighbour. But what is above this, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out evident Reason or a Miracle, is most justly deemed to proceed from no supernaturall assistance but from some Hypochondriacall distemper.</p>

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:115239:40"/>
impute that to God which is proper to Nature. But Melancholy usually disposes, and the mind perfects the action through the power of the Spirit. And a wise and holy man knows how to make use of his opportunity according to that Monition of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, If a man be sad, let him pray; if cheerfull, let him sing Psalmes.</p>
                  <p n="63">63. But there is also a peculiar advantage in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy for divine speculations; and yet the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that result from thence, are no more to be suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of proving meer fancies, because they may occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally spring from such a constitution, then Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall Truths are, who ow their birth to a Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall complexion; Which is as truly a comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion as the Religious complexion is; and yet no sober man will deny the truth of her Theorems. And as it would be a fond and improper thing to affirm that such a complexion teaches a man Mathematicks, so it would also be to affirm that Melancholy is the onely mother of Religion.</p>
                  <p n="64">64. But most certain it is and observation will make it good, That the souls of men while they are in these mortall bodies are as so many Prisoners immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in severall prisons with their fingle loop-holes looking into severall quarters, and therefore are able to pronounce no further then their proper prospect will give them leave. So the severall Complexions of mens bodies dispose or invite them to an easie and happy discovery of some things, when yet notwithstanding if you conferre with them concerning other some that lie not within their prospect or the limits of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Genius, they will be enf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:115239:40"/>
sometimes seems so grosse and invincible that a man may justly suspect that they want not onely the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence but even the power of contemplating of some ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as being not able to frame any conception of what they are required to think of; and such are the duller sort of Atheists that rank the notion of a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and consequently of a God in the list of Inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stencies and ridiculous Non-sense. Wherein though they seek to reproach Religion, they seem to me main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to shame themselves, their Atheisme being very easie to be paralleld with Enthusiasme in this regard. For as some Enthusiasts being found plainly mad in some one thing, have approved themselves sober e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the rest; so these Atheists though they show a tolerable wit and acutenesse in other matters, yet approve themselves sufficiently slow and heavy in this.</p>

                  <opener>SIR,</opener>
                  <p>THE Great deserved fame that followed this noble work of yours (the due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compense of all eminent performances) engaged me to peruse the same, with much eagerness of mind, and yet with no lesse at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; I being one of those, that professe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves much more willing to learn, then able to teach. And that you may see some <hi>specimen</hi> of the fruits of your labour and my proficiency, I thought fit to present you with these few <hi>Observations.</hi> Which, considering the barrennesse of the <hi>Matrix,</hi> (as you Chymists love to call it) in which they were conceived, may be termed rather many then few: And that imputed to the alone virtue, or Magicall Multiplication, or Theomagical fecundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of your Divine Writings, not at all to the steri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb facs="tcp:115239:43"/>
of my disfurnished Braine. Which now not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, having gathered both warmth and moisture from the heat and luxuriancy of your youthfull fansie, findes it selfe after a manner transformed into your own complexion, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into the same temper with your selfe. In so much that although I cannot with the height of a protestation in the presence of my glorious God (as your selfe has gallantly done (<hi>in pag. 50. lin. 17. of Anthropos. Theomag.</hi>) affirme that the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and zeale to the truth of my Creatour has forced mee to write, yet I dare professe in the word of an honest man, that nothing but an inplacable enmity to immorality and foolery has moved me at this time to set Pen to Paper. And I confesse my indignation is kindled the more, having so long observed that this disease is growne even Epidemicall in our Nation. <hi>viz.</hi> to desire to be filled with high-swolne words of Vanity, rather then to feed on sober Truth, and to heate and warme our selves rather by preposterous and fortuitous imaginations, then to move cautiously in the light of a purified minde and improved Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Wherefore I being heightned with the same Zeale of discountenancing of Vanitie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitednesse, that your selfe is of promoting the Truth, you will permit to me the same freedome in the prosecution thereof. For as we are growne neare akin in temper and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion,
<pb facs="tcp:115239:43"/>
so we ought mutually to allow each other in our Actings alike, according to our common Temper and Nature, and the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed Liberty of the <hi>Philalethean</hi> Family. In confidence whereof till wee meete againe in the next Page, I take leave and subscribe my selfe,</p>

                        <hi>Eugenius</hi> taxed of vain glory. Three main ways he atempts to approve himself an extraordinary know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man to the world. His affectation of seeming a Magician discovered in his so highly magnifying <hi>Agrippa,</hi> in the dress of his Title-page, and his submissive address to the <hi>Rosie-brotherhood.</hi> His indiscreet exprobration of ignorance to the <hi>Aristote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans</hi> for not knowing the very essence or substance of the Soule. His uncivil calling <hi>Aristotle</hi> an Ape, and ignorant taxation of his School concerning the frame of the world. The disproportionable Deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of <hi>Eugenius</hi> his World-Animal; and his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just railing against <hi>Aristotles</hi> writings, which he uncivilly tearms his Vomit.</p>
                     <p>ANd now brother <hi>Philalethes,</hi> that we are so well met, let us begin to act according to the freenesse of our tempers, and play the Tom Tell-troths. And you indeed have done your part already. My course is next. Which must be spent in the <hi>Observations</hi> I told you of, upon those profound Treatises of yours, <hi>Anthroposophia Theomagica,</hi> and <hi>Anima Magica Abscondita.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And my first and general Observation is this, That the genius of my brother <hi>Eugenies</hi> magical Discourse is such, that <hi>Simon Magus</hi>-like, he seems to have a very liquoursome desire to be thought to be <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115239:45"/>
some great man in the World. And for the prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this main end, he layes himself out chiefly in these three subordinate designes. First, to be thought to have found out some new concerning Truths, hitherto undiscovered. Secondly, to be more learned &amp; knowing then <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that great light of these European parts, for these many hundred years together: and not onely so, but to be so far above him, that he may be his Master, that he may tew him, and lugge him, and lash him more cruelly, then any <hi>Orbilius</hi> or cholerick Pedagogue, his puny scholars. Thirdly and lastly, that he may strike home for the getting of a fame of profound learning indeed, he do's most affectedly and industriously raise in the Reader a strong surmise and suspicion that he is very deeply seen in Art Magick, and is a very knowing Disciple of <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and puts in as far for the name of a Magician, as honesty will permit, and safety from that troublesome fellow <hi>Hopkins</hi> the Witch-finder.</p>
                     <p>And indeed the very clatter of the Title of his Book, <hi>Anthroposophia Theomagica,</hi> sounds not much unlike some conjuration, or charm, that would either call up, or scare away the Devil. And <hi>Zoroaster</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth, at the bottome of the page, that old reputed Magician, must stand as an Assistent to this preludiall Exorcism; with this Oracle in his mouth, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, <hi>Audi ignis vocem.</hi> That is in plain English, Hear the voice or noise of fire. Me thinks I smell a Gunpowder-plot. What can this voice of fire be? Why! how now <hi>Anthroposophus!</hi> you intend cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to make the <hi>Rosy Brotherhood</hi> merry with squibs and crackers. For certainly your Mysterious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse does not mean those lesser or greater fire-squirts, Carbines or Cannons. So might the <hi>Fratres R. C.</hi> be received with like solemnity that those Apostles at
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115239:45"/>
                        <hi>Rome,</hi> the Cardinals. But the word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, (which implies a subsultation, or skipping this way and that way) which is in the context of this Oracle, seems to allude to, and prognosticate of, Fire-crackers and Squibs rather then Cannons or Carbines. But how ever if this dog-trick fail, <hi>Anthroposophus</hi> has another as puerile and innocent a Present, to entertain that <hi>Reverend Fraternity</hi>: And that's a very queint and trim Latine Epistle, which he, like a good Schoolboy, to shew them what a good Proficient he is grown in his Latine Grammar, presents to their assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Gravities. 'Tis a good child, <hi>Anthroposophus</hi>! and 'tis well done. <hi>Qui nescit obedire, nescit impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re.</hi> He that knows not how to submit himself in the form of a breeching boy to the <hi>Fratres R. C.</hi> how can he know so unmercifully to whip and domineer over poor <hi>Aristotle</hi>?</p>
                     <p>Surely, <hi>Anthroposophus</hi>! when the Rosy brethren ride swooping through the Air in their Theomagicall chariots, they will hail down sugar plums, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rua's on thy blessed pate, if thou hast but the good hap at that time to walk abroad with thy hat off, to cool thy heated nodle.</p>
                     <p>But stay a while, I am afraid I am mistaken. It may well be, that <hi>Anthroposophus</hi> rides along with them, as being the Proloquutour of their Assembly. For he writes himself <hi>Oratoris vestri.</hi> How can that belong to a short Epistle, unlesse it were some Title of office? But it may be my Gentleman, being not so dextrous and quick in Latine as in English, measured the length of it more by his labour then the lines, and thought that that which took him so much pains, could not prove so little as an Epistle; and therefore would insinuate that it was an Oration made to the <hi>Fratres R. C.</hi> I suppose at their meeting at Fryer <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con's</hi> brasen head in <hi>Oxford.</hi>

                        </gap> be it what it will be, my observation here, <hi>Anthroposophus,</hi> is, that you would also by your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse to the <hi>Fratres R. C.</hi> make the world bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eve, that you are now mellowing a pace, and are not much unripe for admission into that Society. And then <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throposophus</hi> would be a rare Theomagician indeed. But enough of this vein of mirth and levity.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>Philalethes!</hi> your brother Tel-troth, intends to fall more closely on your bones, and to discover whether you have not a greater minde to seem to be wise then to be so indeed, or to make others so. But yet you may assure your self, I will onely find flaws, not make any in you; but rather candidly passe over what may receive any tolerably good interpretation, nor touch the sore any where, but where I may hope to heal it, either in your self or others. And that this may be done without any tedious taking a pieces of what you have put together, I shall fairly passe from page to page without any Analyticall Artifice.</p>
                     <p>And truly from the First page to the middle of the Fourth page of your Epistle to the Reader, there be many pretty, smart, elegant, humourous contextures of phrases and things. But there, presently after Fryer <hi>Bacons</hi> Fool and his fellow, you fall upon our Peripateticks as such superficiall Philosophasters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they cannot lay open to you the very <hi>essence</hi> of the Soul. Why! <hi>Anthroposophus</hi>! can you tell the very essence of any Substantiall thing? Hereby you show your self very raw &amp; unexercised in meditation, in that you have not yet taken notice what things are <hi>knowable,</hi> what not. And thus may you have as ill a trick put upon you, for want of this discerning, as the old dim and doting woman had, that with her rotten teeth endeavoured to crack a round pebble stone in stead of a nut, which was a thing impossible.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115239:46"/>
Nor will any mans understanding, be it as sharp as it will, enter the bare <hi>essence</hi> of any thing. But the nearest we can get, is, to know the <hi>powers,</hi> and <hi>opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the respects, and fitnesses</hi> that things have in themselves, or toward others. Which is so true, that any man in a little search, will presently satisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in the evidence thereof.</p>
                     <p>From the middle of this Fourth page to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the sixth, is continued a dance of Anticks, or various ridiculous shiftings and postures of phansie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to make <hi>Aristotle</hi> and his followers contemptible. But such generall railings, as they are mis-beseeming the Writer, so they teach the Reader nothing but that the Authour of them is a Mome, or a Mimick, and more like an Ape by far then him that he compares to one. If this man clap the wings so when he has really got the foil, (for hitherto he has charged <hi>Aristotle</hi> with no particular piece of ignorance but of what is impossible to be known) what would he do if he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d the victory?</p>
                     <p>The second particular taxation (for generals I hold nothing, <hi>Dolosus ambulat in universalibus</hi>) is that the Peripateticks fancy God to have made the World, as a Carpenter of stone and timber. But this is false, because they give an inward principle of motion to all naturall bodies, and there is one conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of all, as much as of the parts of water among themselves. But their grand fault is that they do not say the World is <hi>Animate.</hi> But is not yours far greater, <hi>Anthroposophus</hi>! that gives so ridiculous unproportionable account of that Tenet? The whole World is an <hi>Animal,</hi> say you, whose <hi>flesh</hi> is the <hi>earth,</hi> whose <hi>bloud</hi> is the <hi>water,</hi> the <hi>air</hi> the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward refreshing <hi>spirit</hi> in which it breath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:115239:47"/>
so? For it is as irrationall and incredible, as if you should tell us a tale of a Beast, whose bloud and flesh put together, bears not so great a proportion to the rest of the more fluid parts of the Animal, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his vitall and animal spirits, as a mite in a cheese to the whole globe of the earth. And beside this, how shall this water which you call bloud, be refreshed by the air that is warmer then it? And then those wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which you place in the outmost parts towards his dappled or spotted skin the <hi>coelum stellatum,</hi> what over-p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oportionated plenty of them is there there? In so much that this creature you make a diseased Animall from its first birth, and ever labouring with an <hi>Anasarca.</hi> Lastly, how unproperly is the air said to be the outward refreshing spirit of this Animal, when it is ever in the very midst of it? And how rashly is the Flux and Reflux of the Sea assimilated to the pulse, when the pulse is from the heart, not the brain; but the flux and reflux of the Sea from the Moon not the Sun, which they that be more discreetly phantasticall then your self, do call <hi>Cor Mundi.</hi> Wherefore, <hi>Anthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posophus</hi>! your phansies to sober men, will seem as vain and puerile, as those of idle children that ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the fortuitous postures of spaul and snivell on plaster-walls, to bear the form of mens or dogs faces, or of Lyons, and what not?</p>
                     <p>And yet see the supine stupidity and senslesnesse of this mans judgement, that he triumphs so in this fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his as so rare and excellent a truth, that <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles</hi> Philosophy must be groundlesse superstition and Popery in respect of it, this the primevall truth of the creation; when as it is a thousand times more <hi>froth,</hi> then His is <hi>vomit.</hi> My friend <hi>Anthroposophus! is this to appear for the truth</hi> (as you professe) <hi>in a day of necessity?</hi> Certainly she'll be well holpe at a

dead lift, if she find no better champions then your self.</p>
                     <p>Verily <hi>Philalethes,</hi> if you be no better in your Book then in your Preface to the Reader, you have abused <hi>Moses</hi> his Text beyond measure. For your Principles will have neither heaven nor earth in them, head nor foot, reason nor sense. They will be things <hi>extra intellectum,</hi> and <hi>extra sensum,</hi> meer vagrant imaginations seated in your own subsultorious &amp; skip-jack phansie onely.

But I'll excuse him, it may be he was riding before his entrance into the body on some Theomagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call jade or other, that stumbled and flung him into a mysticall quagmire against his will, where he was so soused and doused and bedaubed and dirtyed, face and eyes and all, that he could never, since the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife raked him out all wet and dropping like a drown'd mouse, once see clearly what was sense and what non-sense to this very day.

whole Spring, damned to the grasse, and fields like <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> when he went on all four among the Beasts. But see how slow this Snail amongst the herbs is, in finding out the truth; when he confesses it was the work of one whole Spring to find out, <hi>That the Earth or seeds of flowers are nothing like the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi> There's not any old Garden-weeder in all <hi>London,</hi> but without a pair of spectacles will discover that in four minutes, which he has been a full fourth part of a year about. But certainly, he intends a great deal of pomp and ceremony, that will not take up such a Conclusion as this, (viz. <hi>That things that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in Nature, are out of something in Nature which is not like the things produced</hi>) but upon the full experience and meditation of one entire Spring. And now after this whole Springs meditation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, he is forced to turn about to him whom he so disdainfully flies, and confesse two of the three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the <hi>Aristotelean</hi> Physicks. <hi>viz.

But he flies off hence, and is in quest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Substance, which he smels out like a nosegay in Natures bosome; which Substance he hopes to see by Art.

But now Sir you have done, I hope it will not be any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to addresse my discourse to you again. And it will not be unseasonable to tell you, that Truth is not to be had of God Almighty for an old song, no nor yet for a new one. And that no man is to measure his wisdome by his devotion, but by his humility and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of mind and unprejudicate reason; nor that any man is wiser by making others seem more contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptibly foolish, as your juvenility has thought good to deal with poor <hi>Aristotle</hi> &amp; his Orthodox Disciples all this time. Nay, and that you may not take Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at <hi>Moses</hi> his Text, let me also tell you, that before you prove any thing thence, you ought first to make good, that Scripture is intended for naturall Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy as well as a divine life. But we need not arm our selves so well yet; for from the fourth page to the eight page nothing is said, but that God from a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Principle made the World. Which <hi>Aristotle</hi> also seems to assert, while he is so frequent in telling the ends of naturall things, which could not be sense, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he supposed that Nature was guided by a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Principle, which is to acknowledge a God after the best manner.

And to call it <hi>Primitive waters</hi> is but yet metaphors and poetry: For you do not mean waters such as we wash our hands in. But they must be <hi>waters</hi> and <hi>dark,</hi> that you may bring in the conceit of the light shining in them, that like as in rivers and pools the images of trees &amp; birds, and clouds and stars, and what not, may be seen in them.

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:115239:50"/>
those images, framed the matter into form. But I pray you tell me, Mr. <hi>Anthroposophus!</hi> that would be so wise as if you stood by while God made the World, doe not you think that God can now see in the dark, or behold his own <hi>Idea's</hi> in the depth of the Earth?

                  <p>THe first thing you require is, that he that attempts your Book, should make a plain and positive Exposition of all the passages. Why man? that is more as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suredly then your self can do. For you are so weak and supine in many things that are intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible, that I am confident you are worse in that which you have made lesse intelligible. For as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> reading an obscure Authour, when he found all things he understood very good, did charitably conclude, what he understood not was much better: so I finding in this obscure Treatise of yours, many things very ill, I also in charity will think you had the wit to conceal those things which are the worst; or, which will serve the turn, that you understand them not your self. But have an itching desire that some Reader skilfuller then your self, should tell you whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you have wrote sense or non-sense: Like the Countrey Clown, that desired his young Master to teach him to write, and being asked how he would be able to read his own writing, being as yet never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted so much as with the christ-crosse-row, made answer he would get some body else to read it for him. And so you <hi>Philalethes</hi>! though you can read your own writing, yet you desire to get some body else to understand it for you, or to interpret to you what you have writ.</p>

The first is, that I would not despise your endevours, because of your yeers, for they are but few. Why man! who knew that but your selfe, if you could have kept your own counsell? Your name is not at your book, much less your age. But indeed many things are so well mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of you, that if you had not told us so, we might have shrewdly suspected, you have scarcely reached the yeers of discretion. But you are so mightily taken with your own performance, that to increase admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and for the bringing in a phrase or sentence out of <hi>Proclus,</hi> you could not with-hold from telling us that you are but a young man, and so we easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. But the more saucy Boy you to be so bold with Reverend Master <hi>Aristotle,</hi> that grandeval Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch in points of Philosophy. For the second ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, it is little more then a noise or clatter of words, or if you will, a meer rattle for a boy to play with. And so I leave it in your hand to passe away the time, till I meet you againe in your <hi>Anima Magica Abscondita.</hi>

The three portions of light must be brought down by the two, the two (if not indeed five, the two and three being now joyn'd) brought down by one, and so the whole chain drops into the water. But would any Ape in a chain if he could speak, utter so much incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible and improbable stuff, with so much munky and mysterious ceremony?

                        <p>Lin. 22. <hi>I am certain the world will wonder I should make use of Scripture to establish Philosophy, &amp;c.</hi> Here, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> you seem self-condemned e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from your own speech, being conscious to your self, that all the world will be against you in this su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious abuse of the Scripture. For are you wiser then all the world beside in this matter, because you have pray'd away all your Logick in St. <hi>Augustines Letanie</hi>? What profane boldnesse is this to distort that high Majesty of the holy Scripture to such poor and pitiful services, as to decide the controversies of the World and of Nature? As well becoming it is, as to set pies and pasties into the oven with the sacred leaves of the Bible? This is but a fetch of imperious Melancholy and Hypocriticall superstition, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretense of being more holy would prove more
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:115239:70"/>
Tyrannicall, and leave the understanding of man free in nothing at all, but bring in a philosophy too, <hi>Iure Divine</hi>! And I can further demonstrate to you (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side what I have intimated from the transcendency of the Scripture, and high scope and aim thereof) that the Scripture teacheth no secret or principle of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, of which there is any doubt amongst men in their wits. For either (as where it seems to speak <hi>ex professo</hi> of any such things) it do's it so obscurely that men rather father their own notions fetch'd from else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, upon the Scripture; or else if it speak more plainly and litterally, yet it being allow'd by all sober men as well Jews as Christians, (as it is indeed undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably evident from the passages themselves in Scripture) that it speaks so ordinarily according to the rude and vulgar use &amp; apprehension of men, there can be no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding collections in matters of Philosophy safely ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of it. Though I will not deny but that some Philosophick truths may have an happy and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful illustration and countenance from passages in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; and their industry is not to be vilified that take any pains therein. But I do not believe that any man that has drove the proper use of the Scripture home to the most full and most genuine effect of it in himself, but will be so wise and so discreet, that he will be ashamed in good earnest to allow any such Philosophick abuse of it. But questionless the Scripture is the beginner, nourisher and emprover of that life and light which is better then all the Philosophy in the world. And he that stands in this light, the firmer and fuller he is possessed of it, he is the more able to judge both of Nature, Reason, and Scripture it self. But he that will speak out of his own rash heat, must needs run the hazard of talking at randum. And this I make the bolder in charity to pronounce, because I
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115239:71"/>
observe that the reverentiall abuse, and religious mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>application of the holy Writ to matters of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, for which it was not intended, do's in many well-meaning men eat out the use of their Reason, for the exercise whereof Philosophy was intended. And hence so much spurious and fantastick knowledge mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplies now adayes, to the prejudice of mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, and to the intangling him in vain and groundlesse imaginations, fortuitously sprung up from uncircumspect Melancholy, dazled and stounded with the streamings and flashes of Its own pertinacious fancy: Which sometime is so powerful as to over-master the Melancholist into a credulity, that these flarings of false light in his dark Spirit are not from himself, but from a Divine Principle, <hi>the Holy Ghost.</hi> And then bidding a due to Reason, as having got some Principle above it, measures all truth merely by the greatnesse and powerfulnesse of the Stroke of the Phantasme. What ever fills the imagination fullest, must be the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And thus a rable of tumultuary and crasse representations must go for so many Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and every heaving up by an <hi>Hypochondria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> flatulency must be conceited a rapture of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; they professing themselves to receive things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from God, when they are but the casuall figurations of their anxious fancy, busily fluttering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Text; which they alwayes eye (though they dissemble it) as Hauks and Buzzards, flie they never so high, have their sight bent upon the Earth.

The truth is, He that layes aside Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, casts away one of the most Soveraign Remedies against all melancholick impostures.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides I say, that the Banks aforesaid are very charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and pious as well as just, and do not return re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge for injury. For whereas the aforesaid River, both by open force and secret undermining, doth day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavour to wear away and destroy the Banks, and encroach upon the neighbouring ground, (which attempt is as sottish and foolish as unjust, for so the River would be lost and drunk up by the Earth; Nor can there be any River without banks, more then an Hill without a valley;) yet notwithstanding all this provocation of the River aforesaid, the Banks are so patient, charitable, and of so Christian-like nature, that they preserve in being and good plight their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate enemy, and keep up that carefully and stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in its right form and perfection, that daily practises and plots their expected destruction.

Thus; Either thou hast read <hi>Des Cartes</hi> his naturall Philosophie, or thou hast not. If thou hast read it, thus to contemn it and term it a Whymzie, (whereas there was never any thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the World in which there is more wary, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til, and close contexture of reason, more coherent uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formitie
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:115239:81"/>
of all parts with themselves, or more happy conformitie of the whole with the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Nature) is to proclaim to all that understand <hi>Des-Carte's</hi> Philosophie, that thou hast a very broken, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient, and unsteddie Apprehension, or a very dull and slow wit, and such as cannot discern when it light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon what is most exactly rationall, and when not. But what is most exactly rationall, as his Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophie indeed is to any competent Judge of Reason, is least of all whymzicall; but whymzies more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally lodge in their brains that are loosly fancifull, not in theirs that are Mathematically and severely wise. So that this reproach returns upon thine own addle pate, O inconsiderate <hi>Philalethes</hi>!

For if I, my dear <hi>Eugenius</hi>! who am your brother <hi>Philale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes,</hi> am forced out of care and judgement to handle you so seeming harshly and rigidly as I do, what do you think would become of you, <hi>si incideres in ipsas Belluas,</hi> if you should fall amongst the irefull <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoteleans</hi> themselves? would you be able to escape a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live out of their hands?

                  <p>I Know that your modesty can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be much amazed at this unexpected Dedication. But the causes once discovered admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will cease. <hi>Eugenius,</hi> as children use to do (who fallen into the dirt by their own folly, commonly make a lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able complaint to their Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against them that help them up, as if they had flung them down) has told a hideous story to his Tutour, as if I had soyl'd him and dirtied him, when as I onely reminded him that he lay in the dirt, which in this case is all one as to help him out of it. Wherefore, that I might hold up the humour every way of opposing my Adversary (as I
<pb facs="tcp:115239:86"/>
must for fashion-sake call him) he making his false and grievous Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Tutour, I thought fit to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect this my true and pleasant Reply to you my Pupil.</p>
                  <p>But if I should say, that this is so much as the least part of what moved me to this act, I confesse I should dissemble. For to say nothing of the Noblenesse of your Descent, which is held ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily a sufficient ground for such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect as this: it is indeed the Sweetness and Candour of your nature, your great Civility and Pleasantnesse of Conversation, your miraculous Profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie in the choicest parts of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, your egregious Perspicacity and kindly Wit, your generous Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of spirit, and true Noblenesse of mind (whom the surly countenance of sad Superstition cannot aw, but the lovely face of Virtue, and radiant Beauty of Divine Knowlodge do

                  <p>IF thou hast perused my Observations upon the two Magicall Treatises of <hi>Eugenius Philalethes,</hi> and his Answer to them, I do not doubt but that seeming and personated sharpnesse of mine will now seem just nothing at all, to thy indifferent judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; if thou compare it with his unchristian bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and inhumane railings against me. For mine own part, I was so farre from all malice, that if I have trespassed, it was from that over-pleasantnesse of temper I was in, when I wrote: which made me perhaps too heedlesse how much I might displease the party with whom I dealt, being secure of the truth of that saying in the Poet,
<q>
                        <l>—Ridentem dicere verum</l>
                        <l>Quis vetat?—</l>
                     </q>
But I find that I have so nettled him unawares, as if his senses lay all in his backside, and had left his brains destitute: Which hath made him very ill-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouredly wrong both himself, the Rod, and the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectour. Verily if I had thought his retentive faculty had been so weak, I would not have fouled my fingers with medling with him. Nor would I now lay on this second gentle lash (I seeing the disposition of my young <hi>Eugenius</hi>) if it were not as well to wipe my self, as to whip him. I could have been content to have been represented to the world as ignorant of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Philosophy, as he hath by his bold and very bad speeches to me, endeavoured to represent me. For I am not bound in conscience to know Nature, but my self; nor to be a deep Philosopher; but to be and approve my self a plain and honest Christian. This
<pb facs="tcp:115239:89"/>
forced me to this Reply. But I thought fit to cast in also, what will prove me no lesse a Philosopher then no Rayler.</p>
                  <p>But I am not contented to justifie my self onely from the successe; but to thy further satisfaction, I shall not think much to acquaint thee with my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses and principles. The truth is, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> though he be so highly conceited of himself, that he thinks his worth is great enough to contract my envy; yet he is so little in my eyes, and my self (I thank God) so little envious, that in this regard he is not at all considerable to me. But my drift was to whip that <hi>Genius</hi> &amp; dispensation he is for the present under, upon <hi>Eugenius</hi> his own back, as having deserved to be an instrument to so good an end. And I perswade my self there are those parts and that freedome in some measure already in this young Philosopher, that in a little time he will say that he deserved this correction, and will laugh for company at the merry punishment, and will freely confesse that I am his brother <hi>Philale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes,</hi> a lover of him and of Truth: And that he that whipped the money-changers out of the Temple, is as much the first <hi>Mastix,</hi> as <hi>Adam</hi> the first <hi>Magicus.</hi> But for the present he is under that dispensation which is as pernicious to the nature of man and Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it self, as it is, to the sober and wise, ridiculous. For he is even in a feaverish thirst after knowledge and fame, and (as he hath made it manifest to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e world) more after fame by farre then knowledge. Wherefore, I observing in his Theomagicall tumour and loftinesse nothing but confident misapplying or conceitedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting the holy Writ, (the drift and meaning whereof is farre above all naturall Philosophy or tricks of Magick whatsoever) and then sleighting and scorning those that, I dare say, he doth not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand,
<pb facs="tcp:115239:89"/>
who yet are very rationall and intelligible, I mean such as <hi>Des Cartes</hi>: and down-right rayling against the <hi>Aristoteleans</hi> and <hi>Galenists,</hi> who yet have many sober and usefull truths amongst them: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, I noting a melancholick, flatuous and heedlesse fancy to appear in his writings, clothed with sonorous and amazing terms, such as might rather astonish the ignorant, then teach the docible: Adde unto all this, that it is too too common a disease now adayes to be driven by heedlesse intoxicating imaginations under pretense of higher strains of Religion and supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall light, and by bidding adieu to sober reason and a purified minde, to grow first fanaticall, and then Atheisticall and sensuall, even almost to the height of abhorred <hi>Gnosticisme</hi>: I thought in good earnest it was very fit, out of my indignation to Foolery and Imposture, out of my detestation to Beastlinesse, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme, and Sensuality, and lastly out of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable respect and tender affection I bear to the Plainnesse and Simplicity of the life of Christ and true divine Wisdome, to take occasion to write in such a manner as I did, and to discountenance that <hi>Genius,</hi> that defaces the new appearing face of Christendome, and is a reproach to that just liberty that belongs to all those that seek after God in sincerity and truth.</p>
                  <p>I but you will say, This indeed may be well meant: Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> what title or right have you to intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, or to correct another mans follies? This is usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation and incivility. To this may many things be answered. It is true; The inward rottennesse of men hath made very smooth laws to themselves in favour of their own follies and vices, and mutuall connivence at what is bad is held the best manners; as if man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind pack'd and conspired together to keep wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse warm in her usurped seat by never taking the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb facs="tcp:115239:90"/>
to examine her title. But to judge more chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably of the generations of men, I think it is more out of self-love, then love to her, and out of a tender dotage toward this imposturous knot of Atoms, our earthly Personality. Which yet I thought I was more favourable to here, having to do onely with fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitious names, not any known Person. But it doth not follow, Though this be the mode, that therefore it is the right fashion: and <hi>Quando ego non curo tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, nè cura meum,</hi> is but surlily said of the old man in the Comedy. That's the principle of <hi>Cain, Am I my brothers keeper</hi>? There was more divine genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity in that noted <hi>Cynick,</hi> then in civility it self, when it is so soft that it will not prick nor hurt vice. He would not spare to speak where things went amisse, however he sped for it; <hi>tanquam Pater omnium, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam Frater omnium,</hi> as they report of him. And I think I have sped ill enough for my but seasonable speaking.</p>
                  <p>But if this be to appeal to too high a law, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer further, that <hi>Eugenius</hi> had forfeited his privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges he might claim by the laws of civility, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self having so uncivilly dealt with others that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all comparison better then he. I but you'll say, Why do you make him so ridiculous in your reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him? Single reproof had been enough. I answer, I did not make him ridiculous, but found him so. He put on himself the pyde coat, and I onely drew aside the curtain. Did not the <hi>Thracian</hi> Girl rightly laugh at <hi>Thales</hi> when she see him stumble into a ditch, whiles he was staring up at the starres? And are not they as ridiculous, that pretend to Seraphick mysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Theories, and are not masters yet of common sense and plamest truths of Christianity? That stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the threshold, or rather grope for the dore as
<pb facs="tcp:115239:90"/>
the blinded <hi>Sodomites?</hi> All the faculties of man are good in themselves, and the use of them, is at least permitted to him, provided that with seasonable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances and upon a right object. And I have made it already manifest that my Act was bounded with these cautions.</p>
                  <p>I, but there is yet something behind unsatisfied. Though <hi>Eugenius</hi> be ridiculous; yet is it not ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, for one that pretends so much to the love of Christianitie as your self, so publickly to laugh at him? That pinches indeed. Why! am I so venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Personage? I am sure I never affected to seem any such to the world yet. I wear no sattin ears, nor silk cap with as many seams as there are streaks in the back of a lute. I affect neither long prayers, nor a long beard, nor walk with a smooth-knobbed staff to sustain my Gravity. If I be a Precisian, as <hi>Eugeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> would have me, it must be from hence, that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely keep my self to the naked truth of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. As for Sects, Ceremonies, superstitious Humours, or specious garbs of Sanctimony, I look on them all, if affected, as the effects of Ignorance, or masks of Hypocrisie. And thus am I <gap reason="foreign">

Or tell me, Who is he in Heaven that laughs them to scorn, that has the opposers of the reigne of Christ in derision?

My selfe saies <hi>Tom Vaughan</hi> I warrant you. Why, then say I, <hi>Tom Vaughan</hi> is <hi>Tom</hi> fool in the play. For the fool in the play is to be the wisest man, according to the known proverb.</p>
                        <p>But how will ye wipe off that aspersion of calling me natural fool? says wise <hi>Tom.</hi> That indeed I confess impossible, because it was never yet laid on. I said on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if you had answered the <hi>Aristoteleans Sic probo's,</hi> with meer laughter, you would have proved your selfe a natural fool. But he hath not done so, nor is <hi>Tom Vaughan</hi> a natural fool, I dare swear for him. He has too much natural heat to be a natural fool. Bless thee from madness, <hi>Tom,</hi> and all will be well.</p>
                        <p>But there is yet something else behind, worse then all this: That all these terms of incivilitie must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from spight and provocation. And this you place

betwixt the two bilious tumours you have raised, as a <hi>ductus communis,</hi> or common chanel to convey the sharp malignant humour to swell them to the full. It is true, my words run thus; <hi>That I have been very fair with you, and though provoked, &amp;c.</hi> But this was spoken in the person of an <hi>Aristotelean,</hi> whom your scornfull usage of their Master <hi>Aristotle</hi> you may be sure did and does provoke. But in good truth, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> you did not provoke me at all with your book, unlesse to laugh at you for your Pue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilities. I, but you have an argument for it, that I was provoked, <hi>viz.</hi> Because your <hi>Theomagicall</hi> discourse has so out done or undone my <hi>Ballade of the Soul</hi> (as you scornfully call it) that my ignorance in the <hi>Platonick</hi> Philosophy has now appeared to the world. <hi>O rem ridiculam</hi>!

This is the Darling of God, and a Prince amongst men, farre above the dispensation of either Miracle or Prophesie.

This is he whom thou callest my fellow fool, to thy own great disparagement. But this is he that I call the wisest Naturalist that ever came to my hands. And having not had the good hap to light on such a rare piece of my own invention, I thought it was the best office I could do the world to bestow my judgment &amp; censure of his. And so now you will say I am become so great a <hi>Cartesian</hi> that I begin to think but meanly of <hi>Platonisme.</hi> A wise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference! as if <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>naturall</hi> knowledge were inconsistent.

But I say that a free divine universalized spirit is worth all. How lovely, how magnificent a state is the Soul of man in, when the life of God inactuating her, shoots her along with himself through Heaven and Earth, makes her unite with, and after a sort feel her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self animate, the whole world, as if she had become God and all things? This is the precious clothing and rich ornament of the mind, far above reason or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther experiment. And in this attire thou canst not but dance to that Musick of the Sibyll.

of Christendome and reproach of men! Is not all this righteously come upon you, because you never sought after Religion, as a thing within you, holy, and divine; but as an excuse to save you from wrath, and yet to remain in your sinnes? But that cannot be: You are in the fewell of wrath while you are in your sinnes, and that fewel will be set on fire some time or other. But that you may be secure of wrath you say there is no sinne, but that it is onely a conceit and a name. Is it not a sinne to be lesse happy ten thousand times then God would have you? Doth not both Sense and Reason discover to you, (I am sure it doth to others) that you walk in the wayes of Hell and death? But you are still secure, you your selves are as much God as any thing else is, and so you may make your Hell as favourable to your selves as you please; But O you fools and blind! I see you cannot; but you are entangled with the cords and snares that the divine <hi>Nemesis</hi> hath laid for the wicked in all the parts of the world. But you are not yet any thing moved, O ye dead in trespasses and sinnes! For there is no God, say you, more then a dog or a horse is God. Behold, O ye forlorn wretches and miserably mistaken! Behold, He is come down to you: nay, He is ever with you, and you see him not. Ask of him, and He shall answer you. Demand of him, and He shall declare unto you, not in obscure words or dark sayings, not in aenigmaticall speeches or parables; but He will speak unto your own reason and faculties which he hath given you: propound therefore unto him why you think the Soul of man is mortal, and why you deny an omnipotent and omniscient God distinct from Nature and particular Beings: pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound unto him, and He will plainly answer you. But alas! alas! your are neither fit to hear, nor able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:115239:101"/>
for you have destroyed those faculties that he hath given you by sinning against the light of them; and now you have drunk out your eyes, you swear there is no Sun in the Firmament: and now you have whored away your brains, you are confident there is no God. O sunk and helplesse generation! how have you sop'd and soaked, overflown and drown'd the highest seat and <hi>Acropolis</hi> of your soul, that through your sensuality it is grown as rotten and corrupt as a dunghil? You have made your selves as fit to judge of reason, as if your heads were stuffed with wet straw. These things hath the divine Indignation uttered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you, but more for reproof then reproach. But your sinne hath made you sottish, and your sottish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse confident and secure. But his anger burns against you; O you false Religionists! and the wrath of God will overtake you when you are not aware: and your shame shall ascend up like the smoke of the bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse pit, and your stink shall be as the filthinesse in the valley of the children of Hinnom. This will be the portion of all those that barter away sound reason and the sober faculties of the soul for boisterous <hi>words of vanity,</hi> and unsetled conceits of Enthusiasts, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neither reason, nor Scripture, nor conspicuous mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, row down with the stream of mens corruptions, and ripen and hasten the unclean part in man, to a more full and speedy birth of sinne and ungodlinesse.

For God hath permitted to me all these things, and I have it under the broad seal of Heaven. Who dare charge me? God doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit me. For he hath made me full Lord of the four elements, and hath constituted me Emperour of the world. I am in the <hi>fire of choler,</hi> and am not burned: In the <hi>water of phlegme,</hi> and am not drowned: In the <hi>aiery sanguint,</hi> and yet not blown away with every blast of transient pleasure, or false doctrines of men: I descend also into the sad <hi>earthy Melancholy,</hi> and yet am not buryed from the sight of my God. I am, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> (though I dare say thou takest me for no bird of Paradise) <hi>Incola coeli in terra,</hi> an inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant of Paradise and Heaven upon Earth: and the <hi>white stone</hi> is mine, however thou scramblest for the Philosophers stone. (I wish thou hadst them both, that is all the harm I wish thee.) I still the raging of the sea, I clear up the sowring Heavens, and with my breath blow away the clouds. I sport with the beasts of the Earth, the Lion licks my hand like a Spaniell, and the Serpent sleeps upon my lap and stings me not. I play with the fowls of Heaven, and the birds of the Air sit singing on my fist. All the Creation is before me, and I call every one of them by their proper names. This is the true <hi>Adam,</hi> O <hi>Philalethes</hi>: This is Paradise, Heaven, and Christ. All these things are true in a sober sense. And the Dispensation I live in, is more happinesse above all measure, then if thou
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115239:102"/>
couldst call down the Moon so near thee by thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick charms that thou mightest kisse her, as she is said to have kissed <hi>Endymion,</hi> or couldest stop the course of the Sunne, or which is all one, with one stamp of thy foot, stay the motion of the Earth. All this externall power in Nature were but as a shop of trinkets and toyes, in comparison of what I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto you. And an <hi>adulterous generation</hi> onely <hi>seeks after a signe,</hi> or idiots, such as love to stare on a dexterous jugler when he playes his tricks. And therefore they being of so little consideration in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; I see and am satisfied why miracles are no more frequent in the world. God intends an higher dispensation, and greater happinesse for these later times, wherein Divine Love and Reason, and for their sakes Liberty will lay claim to the stage. For He will as I told you <hi>draw</hi> us with the <hi>cords of a man,</hi> not <hi>ride</hi> us as with a <hi>bridle</hi>-like a horse, or tug us along like a mad stear in a band. He will sanctifie our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward faculties, and so take possession of the Earth. But that a man may not deplore what is lamentable, or be angry at what is injurious to God or Goodness, or laugh at what is ridiculous, this is not any part of that Law that is made manifest in the Heavenly life, but the arbitrarious precepts of supercilious <hi>Stoicks,</hi> or surly Superstitionists. For God hath sanctified and will sanctifie all these things. Nor am I at all mad or fanatick in all this, O you unexperienced and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise! For as our Saviour said of his body, <hi>Touch me and handle me</hi>: so say I of my soul: feel and try all the faculties of it if you can find any crack or flaw in them. Where is my Reason inconsequent or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the Attributes of God, the common No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, the <hi>Phaenonema</hi> of Nature or with it self? Where is my Fancie distorted, unproportionate,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:115239:102"/>
unproper? But for the bottome of all these, that, I confesse, you cannot reach to nor judge of, that is <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine sense,</hi> the <hi>white stone,</hi> in which there is a name written that none can read but he that hath it. But for the guidance of my reason and imagination, they have so safe a Stearsman, <hi>viz.</hi> that Divine touch of my soul with God, and the impregnation of my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding from the most High; that judgement and caution have so warily built the outward fabric of words and fancy, that I challenge any man to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any ineptitude in them, or incoherencie.</p>
                     <p>And now verily the serious consideration of these weighty matters hath so composed my mind, that I find it some difficultie to discompose it into a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per childish enough to converse with my young <hi>Eugenius.</hi> But as high as I have taken my sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I will descend, and go lesse my self, to bring him to what is greater.

But how it is to be understood I perceive thou dost not know. I am ashamed that I must be fain to rub up in thee the very first rudiments of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick,</hi> or rather teach thee them. For couldst thou ever forget what is meant by <hi>Accidentall,</hi> what by <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall? Accidentall</hi> is that which may be or not be in a thing, and yet the thing be: As a horse may be a horse, be it black or white. <hi>Essentiall</hi> is that which so belongs to the thing to which it is said to be Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall, that the thing cannot be conceiv'd to exsist without it; Now, say I, these Faculties of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, Reason, and Sense are essentiall to the Soul of man, because we cannot conceive a Soul without a power or faculty of understanding, reasoning, &amp;c. And <hi>Aristotle</hi> has defined a Soul from these. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would a <hi>Peripatetick</hi> say, with an <hi>Essentiall</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition:

                           <hi>To have made the world as a Carpenter, of stone and timber.</hi> Thou hast misplaced a comma in the sentence to make a Cavil. Put on thy spectacles, and see if there be any comma before <hi>of</hi> in my Book. If you understood common sense you could not but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that my meaning is this; That you tax the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripateticks</hi> for fancying God to have made the world as a Carpenter makes houses of stone and timber. Now pitifull Caviller! But to the point. I say this is a false taxation, <hi>Eugenius:</hi> For the parts of the world, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> own doctrine, are set in this order they are, from an inward principle of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and their own proper qualities: so that they do as the stones and trees are said to have done at the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:115239:105"/>
of <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Amphion,</hi> move of themselves. But the stone and timber in the work of a Carpenter, do not move themselves into their places they ought to be, for the building up of an house. But you an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer two things to this: First, that the parts of the world do not move themselves: Secondly, that if they do, then they have infusion of life. To the first: Why, do's not any part of the earth move it self down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, if it be in an higher place then is naturall to it, and the aire and fire upward, &amp;c. and this from an inward principle of motion? Nay, is not the very definition of Nature, <hi>Principium motûs &amp; quietis, &amp;c.</hi> wherefore we see plainly, that according to the <hi>Aristoteleans,</hi> all to the very concave of the Moon have an inward principle of motion. And for the Heavens themselves, the most sober and cautious of the <hi>Peripateticks</hi> hold them to be moved from an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Principle, their <hi>Forma informans,</hi> as they call it. So that though they do not allow life infused into the world, yet they allow an inward principle of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in naturall bodies, which is their Substantiall Forms, by virtue whereof they are ranged in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as we see; or at least according to which they are thus ranged and ordered. And this is not so dead a businesse as the Carpenters building with stone and timber. But in the second place you say, That if they have this motion from an inward principle, then they have also infusion of life. But do not you see plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that (according to the mind of the more sober <hi>Peripateticks</hi>) they have motion from an inward Principle? Therefore you should have been so farre from taxing them to look upon God as a Carpenter, that you should have concluded rather that they held infusion of life.</p>

O thou confounded and undone thing! how hast thou shamed thy self! Thy vizard is fallen off, and thy sanctimonious clothing torn from about thee, even as it was with the Apes and Monkies, that being attired like men and wearing vizards over their faces did daunce, and cringe, and kisse, and do all the gestures of men so artificially &amp; becomingly, that the Countrey people took them to be a lesser size of humane race, till a waggish fellow that had more wit then the rest, dropt a few nuts amongst them, for which they fell a scrambling so earnestly, that they tore off their vizards, and to the great laughter of the spectatours show'd what manner of creatures they were. O <hi>Magicus</hi>! do not dissemble before me: For thou dost not know with what eyes I behold thee. Were it not better for thee and all the world beside, to make it their businesse to be really and fully possest of those things that are undoubtedly good and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, nay, indeed if they be had in the right Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are the very buds and branches of the tree of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, the limbs and members of the Divine nature, such as are meeknesse, patience, and humility, discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, freedome from self-interest, chastity, temperance,

These are in the pulse of a true <hi>Animal,</hi> but are not to be found in the Flux of the sea; For it is not in all places at once, nor is the water rarefied where it is.

But believe it <hi>Eugenius,</hi> thou wilt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make sense of this Flux and Reflux, till thou calm thy fancy so much as to be able to read <hi>Des-Cartes.</hi> But to tell us it is thus from an inward form, <hi>more A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotelico</hi>; is to tell us no more, then that it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Beast, or to make Latine words by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding onely the termination <hi>bus,</hi> as <hi>hosibus</hi> and <hi>shoosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> as Sir <hi>Kenhelm Digby</hi> hath with wit and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment applied the comparison in like case. But now to put the bloud, flesh and bones together, of your <hi>World-Animal</hi>: I say they bear not so great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the more fluid parts. <hi>viz.</hi> the vitall and animal spirits thereof, as a mite in a cheese to the whole globe of the Earth. So that if thou hadst any fancy or judgement in thee, thy similitude would appear to thine own self outragiously ugly and disproportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and above all measure ridiculous: Nor do not think to shuffle it off, by demanding, If there be so little earth, to tell thee where it is wanting. For I one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly say, that if the world be an <hi>Animal,</hi> there will be much bloud and flesh wanting, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> for so great a Beast. Nor do not you think to blind my eyes with your own Tobacco smoke, (I take none my self, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius,</hi>) For to that over ordinary experiment, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer two things. First, that as you took upon the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:115239:108"/>
parts of the body of a true <hi>Animal,</hi> in the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension that they now actually are, not how they may be altered by rarefaction; so you are also look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the parts of your <hi>World-Animal,</hi> as they are <hi>de facto,</hi> extended, not how they may be by rarefaction. And thus your Argument from Tobacco, will vanish into smoke. But if you will change the present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of any lesser <hi>Animal</hi> by burning it, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many of the grosse parts into more thin and fluid, you destroy the ground of your comparison, betwixt the <hi>World Animal</hi> and it; for you take away the flesh of your lesser <hi>Animal</hi> thus burnt. And besides, the proportion betwixt the vapour or thinner parts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension to the remaining ashes, is not yet so big, as of the thin parts of the <hi>World-Animal</hi> in respect of its solid parts, by many thousand and thousand millions. Nay, I shall speak within compasse, if I say (as I said before) that there is a greater disproportion then betwixt the globe of the Earth and a mite in a cheese. This is plainly true to any that understands common sense. For the Earth in respect of the World is but as an indivisible point. Adde to all this, that if you will rarefie the Tobacco or <hi>Hercules</hi> body by fire, I will take the same advantage, and say, that the water and many parts of the earth may be also rarefied by fire, and then reckon onely upon the remaining ashes of this globe, and what is turned into vapour must be added to the more fluid parts of the <hi>World-Animal,</hi> to increase that over-proportion. So that thou hast answered most wretchedly and pitifully every way, poor <hi>Anthroposophus</hi>! But besides, In the second place: When any thing is burnt, as for example, your Tobacco, I say it takes up then no more room then it did before: Because Rarefaction and Condensation is made, <hi>per modum spongiae,</hi> as a sponge is distended

But if thou thinkest it hard, that so little a body as a pipe of Tobacco, should be multiplied into so very much superficies above what it had before, go to those that beat out leaf gold, and understand there how the superficies of the same body may be, to wonder, increased. And beside, I could demonstrate to thee, that a body whose basis thou shouldst ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine at the center of the Earth, and top as farre above the starry Heaven, as it is from thence to the Earth, without any condensation used thereunto, is but equal to a body that will he within the boll of a Tobacco-pipe.

                           <hi>The aire is the outward refreshing spirit, where this vast Creaure breaths.</hi> Two things I here object, to shew the ineptnesse and incongruity of this compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. The one is taken from the office of respiration, which is to refresh by way of refrigerating or cooling. Is not the main end of the lungs to cool the bloud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it enter into the left ventricle of the heart? But thou art so Magical, thou knowst none of these sober and usefull mysteries of Nature. All that thou an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerest to this is, That we are refresh'd by heat as well as by coolnesse. Why then is that generall sufficient
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:115239:109"/>
to make up your analogie or similitude? This is as well fancied as it is reasoned, when men conclude af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatively in the second figure. There are laws in fancy too, <hi>Philalethes</hi>: and I shall shew thee anon, how ridiculous thou hast made thy self by transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them. If thou meanest by refresh'd, to be chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or restored onely, and what ever do's this must be ground enough to fancy a respiration; then thou breathest in thy cawdle, when thou eatest it, and hast spoyled that conceit of his, that said he never would drink sack whilst he breathed; for if sack do in any sense refresh and comfort a man, it seems he breaths while he drinks. I tell thee, in the <hi>Homologi termini</hi> of similitudes, there ought to be something in some sort peculiar and restrained, or else it is flat, ridiculous, and non-sense. The other objection was taken from the situation of this aire that is to he the matter of Respiration in this great <hi>Animal.</hi> What a wild dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is there in this? The aire that an ordinary <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal</hi> breaths in, is external; the aire of this <hi>World-Animal,</hi> internall; so that it is rather wind in the guts, then aire for the lungs; and therefore we may well adde the <hi>Colick</hi> to the <hi>Anasarca.</hi> Is the wind-Colick an outward refreshing spirit, or an inward griping pain? Being thou hast no guts in thy brains, I suspect thy brains have slipt down into thy guts, whither thy tongue should follow to be able to speak sense. Answer now like an <gap reason="foreign">

He answers, and the point and sting of all the sense of his answer is in the tail of it: <hi>pag.</hi> 29. <hi>lin.</hi> 11. <hi>and it is their outward refreshing spirit.</hi> He means the Earths and the Waters. O feeble sting! O foolish answer! This onely reaches so farre as to save the Earth alive from my jugulating objection. The globe of Earth and Water indeed
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:115239:110"/>
may be still an <hi>Animal</hi> for all that objection. But thou saidst the whole World was an <hi>Animal.</hi> What, is the whole world an <hi>Animal</hi> because the Earth is one? O bundle of simples! (to return thee thine own parcell of ware again, for it belongs not to me) this is as well argued as if thou shouldest say, That a cheese is an <hi>Animal,</hi> because there is one living mite in it. But that this Earth neither is a breathing <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal,</hi> is plain enough: For what respiration, what at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction and reddition of aire is there in it? There may be indeed something answering to sweating and perspiration, nothing to respiration, my good <hi>Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lethes.</hi> But to shew thee thy folly, I will follow thy liberty, and impudently pronounce that a pair of bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows is an <hi>Animal.</hi> Why, is it not? It has a nose to breathe through, that's plain, the two handles are the two eares, the leather the lungs, and that which is the most seemly analogie of all, the two holes in the back-side are the two eyes; as like the eyes in the fore-side of a Crab as ever thou seest any thing in thy life: Look thee, <hi>Phil.</hi> are they not? You'll say, The ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie of the nose is indeed as plain as the nose on a mans face: But how can the handles be eares, when they stand one behind another? whereas the eares of <hi>Animals</hi> stand one on one side, and the other on the other side of the head. And then how can the leather be lungs, they being the very outside of its body? Or those two holes eyes? They have neither the situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as being placed behind, nor office of eyes. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer me all these objections. O <hi>Mastix</hi>! I can fully answer them, O <hi>Magicus</hi>! This is an <hi>Animal</hi> drawn out according to thine own skill and principles. The leather sayst thou must be no lungs, because it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. Why then the aire must be no aire for thy <hi>World-Animal</hi> to breath, because it is within: And
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:115239:110"/>
if thou canst dispense with <hi>within</hi> and <hi>without,</hi> much more mayst thou with <hi>before</hi> and <hi>behind,</hi> or <hi>behind</hi> and <hi>on the sides.</hi> So the eares and lungs of this <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> hold good against thee still. Now to preserve my monsters eyes against this <hi>Harpy</hi> that would scratch them out; They are no eyes say you, because they have not the situation of eyes. But I told thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thou makest nothing of situation. But they have not the office of eyes. Why? They can see as much as the eyes of thy <hi>World-Animal,</hi> for ought thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est. I but this <hi>Bellows-Animal</hi> breaths at these eyes: And have not I shewed thee thy <hi>World-Animal</hi> breaths in his guts? But I will make it plain to thee that those two holes are eyes: For they are two, as the two eyes are; and transmit the thin air through them, as the eyes do the pure light. So that they agree gainly well in the generall: As your Respiration in the <hi>World-Animal,</hi> in refreshing, though by heat, when in others it is by cold. Fie on thee, for a <hi>Zoographicall</hi> Bungler. These Bellows thou seest is not my <hi>Animal</hi> but thine, and the learned shall no longer call that instrument by that vulgar name of a pair of Bellows, but <hi>Tom Vaughans Animal.</hi> So famous shalt thou grow for thy conceited foolery.</p>

But do not chock me under the chin, thou wag, when I look up. Now, what must I see? <hi>What a number of bonefires, lamps, and torches are kindled in that mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous celestiall water.</hi> Yes, I see them all. I suppose they burn so clear for joy and triumph, that my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Sense have so victoriously overthrown thy Fantastry and Non-sense. But why miraculous wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>Phil?</hi> I see the cause: Bonefires and torches burn in the waters.

But what, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> wilt thou venture in Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick coolnesse, to say the sense of thy <hi>World-Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> lies in the starres? I prethee, what can those starry eyes spy out of the world? They are very quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sighted, if they can see there, where there is nothing to be seen. But it may be, this <hi>Animal</hi> turns its eyes inward and views it self, I would <hi>Philalethes</hi> were

such an <hi>Animal</hi> too; He would then find so much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse within, that he would forbear hereafter to be so censorious without. But what? is there sense then onely in the starres? (For sense can be no where but where there is accesse for the Animal spirits:) So it seems, the starres must hear as well as see, nay, feel and tast; as they do questionlesse, as often as they lick in, and eat up that starre-fodder, the vapours, wherewith in <hi>Seneca</hi> they are fantastically said to be nourished. And thus you see, that <hi>Tom Vaughans Animal,</hi> I mean <hi>the Bellows</hi> now may see at the very same two holes that it breathes at, for he confounds all by his indiscreet fancy. How art thou blown about like a feather in the air, O thou light-minded <hi>Eugenius</hi>! How vain and irrationall art thou in every thing! Art thou the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> as thy Sanguin a little o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowing thy Choler would dresse up thy self to thy soft imagination, and make thee look smugg in thy own eyes? Had that Queen so little manners, in her addresses to so great a Philosopher? No, thy lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage in all thy book, is the language of a scold and of a slut. And for thy wit, if thou wilt forgo thy right to the ladle and bells, thy feminine brains, as thou callest them, may lay claim to the <hi>maid-mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> place in the Morris-dance: while my strong cruds, (as thou tearmest my masculine understanding) which are as sweet as strong, not tainted with the fumes of either revenge or Venery, shall improve their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most strength, for the interest of Truth and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                        <p>And thus have I taken all thy Outworks, <hi>Eugeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> yea and quite demolished them. Yet now I look better about me, there is I perceive, one Half-moon standing still. Wherefore have at thy Lunatick an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to that which thou callest my Lunatick argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:115239:112"/>
which thou propoundest thus; <hi>That the Flux and Reflux cannot be the pulse of the great World, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it proceeds, from the Moon, not from the Sunne.</hi> I say, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> The Sunne being the heart of the world, according to those that be more discreetly fantasticall (consult Dr. <hi>Fludd,</hi> thou art but a bad chip of that block) it was to be expected, if thou wouldst have the Flux and Reflux to be the Pulse, that it should come from the Sun, that is reputed the heart of the world; but it comes from the Moon. To this you answer; That it comes no more from the Moon, then from that fictitious <hi>Anti-selene</hi> or <hi>Anti-moon,</hi> as you venture to call it. You say thus, but prove nothing. But there is such an apparent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion betwixt this <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> of the Flux and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux, and so constant with the course of the Moon, that it is even unimaginable but that there should be the relation of cause and effect betwixt them. But I think you will not say, That the motion of the Sea has any power or effect upon the course of the Moon; wherefore it must be granted, that the course of the Moon has an effectuall influence upon the Flux of the Sea. And therefore <hi>Fromundus</hi> speaks very expressely concerning this matter, and very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily in these words:

to this sense; <hi>If we can gather any thing from effects concerning the cause, it seems to be as experimentally sure, that the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea is made and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the Moon, as that heat flows from the fire, or light from the Sunne.</hi> For indeed how could there be kept such inviolable laws, as that the Ocean should alwayes swell at the Moons ascending; and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:115239:112"/>
so, but attemperately and proportionably to her motion, (for she coming every day later and later a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the <hi>Horizon,</hi> the Flux of the Sea is later and later every time, according to her recession toward the East in her monethly course) I say, How could these laws be so accurately observed, Mr. <hi>Eugenius,</hi> if the Moon were not accessory to, nay, the principall causer of this Flux and Reflux of the Sea?

wit cannot distinguish betwixt the <hi>Formale</hi> and <hi>Materiale</hi> of that whence the similitude is fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which made thee so ill digest my Philosophick Bacon. It was thine own Magick, <hi>Phil.</hi> or perverse imagination that turned thee into an Hog with tusks and bristles, not I. But to return to the businesse: O thou judicious Critick! What is the fault? where is the flaw in what thou hast recited?
<q>

Thou dost onely play wich the feather of the quill. But for what is writ with the inky end thereof, in those Poems of mine, I challenge thee to shew me if thou canst, where my fancy or reason hath really tript. Thou indeed hast attempted something in the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> way, but I have made it manifest, thou hast writ with the quill of a goose. But I have penned down the praise of <hi>Plato's</hi> Philosophy in this Canto, with the skill of a man, as any man that hath skill will acknowledge. But thy spirit is not yet prepared for the knowledge of such divine matters. It is not yet fine, gentle, and benigne enough, to receive so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious impressions. Put thy soul into a crysiple, O pragmaticall <hi>Chymist,</hi> and set it on that fire that will excoct and purge out thy drosse, and then judge of <hi>Platonisme.</hi> Art not thou the Chymicall Monkey that art very busie to little purpose about the glasses of <hi>H. Blunden,</hi> an honest man and an happy Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour in Chymistrie as I hear? But thou dost nothing but lear and look up at the reek of the furnace, and sendest as high <hi>Theomagicall</hi> meditations after every fold or curle of smoke that mounteth up, as the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Ape after the flur and farre flight of every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge he let out of the basket. But enough of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. Now to expiate the excesse of this mirth with
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115239:114"/>
something more solid and sober. I am ready to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer what thou alledgest, and to make good that my first Observation is no oversight.</p>
                        <p>Thou art here mistaken in two things. First, in that thou conceivest that <hi>Reminiscency</hi> is so strong an argument to prove the Preexistency of the soul before her entrance into the body. I say it is not any argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment worth the insisting upon. For though the Soul do finde truth in her self, questions being wisely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to her; yet she doth not perceive that she ever though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> of those things before, and therefore cannot acknowledge any such Reminiscency in herself. And I appeal unto thine own reason, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> if God should create an humane soul, and put it into a body fit and complyable with contemplation, whether that Soul would not be able to answer all the questions propounded in <hi>Plato's Meno,</hi> as well as those that are supposed to preexist. And therefore I have not made use of this argument in all my <hi>Platonical</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ems. For I tell thee, <hi>Phil.</hi> I am a very wary Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher, and he must rise betimes that goes about to impose upon my reason. Thy second mistake is, that thou thinkest I condemn thy opinion of the Preex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istency of the soul, which indeed I might well do as personating an <hi>Aristotelean.</hi> But what I really blame there, is thy boldnesse and disadvantagious rashnesse in the proposall of it, thou intimating, as if the soul descended into the body with her eyes broad awake, which the first page of thy Praeface to the Reader doth plainly imply. Let any one read and judge. But if any one ask what my opinion is, I answer, It is no matter what my opinion is, as it is mine, (for what man is <gap reason="foreign">

                        </head>
                        <p>Here, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> I charged thee with three ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities.</p>
                        <p>The first was affectation of pomp and ceremony in the finding out those things which cannot be hid from the eyes of the meanest capacity. As pretending it was a whole springs task, to find out this conclusion, viz. <hi>That things that are produced in Nature, are out of something in Nature unlike the things produced.</hi> To this thou answerest; that thou art not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, as if thou wert a whole spring in finding out this co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>clusion: For thou onely saist, <hi>I took to task the fruits of one spring.</hi> But I say, that <hi>one spring</hi> may signifie <hi>a whole spring,</hi> and your making a task of it seems to determine the words to that sense. And unlesse thou tookest the pains of examining all the flowers that grew in the spring, one after another, I mean their kinds; it would prove no task, or at least be no proof for thy conclusion. And therefore in all likelihood, <hi>one spring</hi> should signifie here <hi>a whole spring.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The second was, that thou art fain to admit of two of <hi>Aristotles</hi> Principles, <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Privation.</hi> And this I inferred from the foregoing Conclusion. But thou answerest, <hi>That thou hast not so much as named Privation, much lesse acknowledged it for a Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> That's no matter. Though thou hold thy peace, thy Observations speak it. That <hi>Viola est ex non vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, Rosa ex non Rosa,</hi> &amp;c. Which is the very same thing the Peripateticks observe to be necessarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in all generation, and therefore they make a Principle of it, and call it <hi>Privation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The third absurditie was, that you seemed so sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:115239:115"/>
as to ptomise your self that you would find out the <hi>First Matter,</hi> or the common matter of all things, by experience. To which you answer, <hi>That you have found it out, felt it, and seen it.</hi> Well, <hi>Euge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> thou art grown a great Proficient, I perceive, since the last time I met thee. For then thou wast to seek for this <hi>First Matter,</hi> now thou hast found it and felt it. Hast not thou felt the Ephialtes, <hi>Phil?</hi> or is not thy fancy as grosse and thick as a syrup? I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thou art as much <hi>Iesuite</hi> as I <hi>Puritan,</hi> tell me truly <hi>Philalethes,</hi> dost not equivocate in this answer? and understandest by this <hi>First Matter,</hi> onely the first matter of <hi>some things,</hi> as meal is the first matter of pudding, and pycrust, and bread, and the like. But if thou saist thou hast seen and felt the First matter of <hi>all things</hi> whatsoever, thou hast pronounced what is impossible to be proved, and therefore as impossible to be believed by the sober and wise. And yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse thou pronounce thus, thou pronouncest nothing to the present purpose. For, by <hi>first Matter,</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood the common matter of all things. But now to rebuke thy boldnesse in this assertion: Let me ask thee a sober question or two. This <hi>first Matter,</hi> which thou soughtest after, and now hast found, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hadst thou any marks to know it by, when thou didst light on it? For as <hi>Venus</hi> in the Poet, when she sends hue and cry after her little <hi>Fugitive,</hi> describes him from his marks;
<q>
                              <l>
                                 <gap reason="foreign">
                                    <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                                 </gap>.</l>
                           </q>
So what ever is sought for by us, we ought to have an idea of it, that we may know it when we find it. As he that is to seek an horse in the field, if he have not an idea of an horse and of a cow, &amp;c. he may bring one for the other. To be short, he that seeks without an idea of what is sought, seeks for he knows not
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:115239:116"/>
what, and he will find it he knows not when. So that it was necessary for thee to have an idea of the <hi>first Matter</hi> in thy mind, when thou wentest about to find it out. Now tell me, what the idea of the <hi>first Matter</hi> can be, if not this? <hi>A substance out of which all corporeall things are made, but it self out of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> And this is, if thou understandest truth when it is propounded to thee, as true an idea of the <hi>first Matter,</hi> as, <hi>to have three angels,</hi> is the right idea of a <hi>Triangle.</hi> But answer me now, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> in good earnest. Is that <hi>Matter</hi> which thou saist thou hast seen and handled, such as will fit with this idea? How canst thou ever prove but that that matter was made of some other matter otherwise modified, as well as other things may be made of this? But I will deal very candidly with thee, <hi>Philalethes</hi>: For I would fain have thee speak some sense. The idea of thy <hi>first Matter</hi> thou meanest may happily be this. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> so prepared and qualified by the Art of <hi>Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,</hi> that it is fit to receive any form whatsoever, or <hi>Matter</hi> that is reduced to such a temper as it all was of at first, when it lay fitted for receiving of all forms of what nature so ever, and by this fitnesse engaged them to lodge in her large bosome. And thus though this <hi>Matter</hi> of thine be made of another matter, yet, because it is reduced to the state it was in first of all, before it received any forms, and was contrived into this order and distinction of parts that constitute the world, it may in this sense be called the <hi>first Matter.</hi> But tell me, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> how knowst thou that thou hast light on such a <hi>Matter</hi> as this? Thou hadst no preconceived idea of the colour and consistency of this matter which thou saist thou hast felt and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>een, unlesse somebody hath described it to thee, from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain sensible qualities. But then I would ask both
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:115239:116"/>
them and thee, how they know that a Body of this consistency and colour is the <hi>first matter</hi>? It is either because that they observe, that, what ever they resolve by their <hi>Chymicall</hi> fires is resolved into this at last, or because they have observed that all things will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise out of this matter. But for the first: I say, they have not, nor can make triall of all things by their Art. For how many things appear above us out of our reach? besides what he eternally buried below. They can not distill the stars, as some say, glow-worms may be, and make them lamps of them to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by. Besides, why is that which is left, to be the <hi>first matter</hi> more then what is flown away and evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated? And that which will not evaporate, I demand whether that is the <hi>first matter</hi> of air and light? Adde to all this, That you do not so much find this <hi>first matter</hi> as make it in all likelyhood. For how incredible a thing is it, but that by your fires or heats, (you putting the body that is under your operation into a perpetuall motion, so that the parts fridge one against another uncessantly) the nature of it should be quite changed by you. So that you do not by a kind of <hi>Analysis</hi> discover what is at the bottome, but by <hi>Genesis</hi> modifie the matter into a new dresse. But that's no matter you'll say, so long as it is reduced to such a temper as it was, when the whole world was to be impregnated with several forms. But there is no way now left for you to know that you have thus reduced it, unlesse you have seen this <hi>Matter</hi> of yours, <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnus</hi>-like to appear before you in all shapes Tell me then, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> Have you seen it put on the form of a Sponge? of a Pumex? of Adamant? of Marble? Have you seen it put on the shape of all plants whatsoever and Animals? to say nothing of metals and mineralls. Have you play'd with it in the
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:115239:117"/>
shape of a dog? or has it roared against you in the form of a lion? or have you made sport with the mustacho's of it in the figure of a mouse? Ha's <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racelsus</hi> his <hi>homunculus</hi> come tumbling out of it, with his tail upwards in signe of good luck? or hast thou conferr'd with it in the dresse of a wanton La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, clothed with transparent lawns or Sybariticall tiffanies? If thou hast not, (and darest thou say thou hast?) thou hast no reason at all to say thou hast seen and felt the <hi>first Matter</hi> of all things. It is but vain boasting and bold imposture. Adde unto all this; That if there were any such <hi>matter</hi> as thou meanest, so fit for all forms, and yet fitted with none, the <hi>Mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus vitae,</hi> or <hi>world of Lives and Forms</hi>) being eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where present so as it is, this destitute widow, or marriageable Virgin could be no more kept from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>? I appeal to thine own reason if thou canst any wayes shift it, but that thou must conceive a matter variously changed into severall succeeding forms.

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:115239:121"/>
of sober men it will appear, that thy Argument hath no agreement neither with Philosophy nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense. Now therefore to instruct thee, as well as I do sometimes laugh at thee; I will endeavour to make these two things plain to thee. First, That Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture speaks according to the outward appearance of things to sense and vulgar conceit of men.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, That following this Rule, we shall find the Extent of the World to be bounded no higher then the clouds, or thereabout: So that the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, viz: the Air, (for the <hi>Hebrews</hi> have no word for the Air, distinct from Heaven or Firmament, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> making no distinction) may be an adequate barre betwixt the lower and upper waters. Which it was requisite for <hi>Moses</hi> to mention, vulgar observation discovering that waters came down from above, <hi>viz.</hi> showers of Rain, and they could not possibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that unlesse there were waters above, that any water should descend thence. And this was it that gave occasion to <hi>Moses,</hi> of mentioning those two waters, the one above, the other beneath the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>But to return to the first point to be proved, That Scripture speaks according to the outward appearance of things to sense, and vulgar conceit of men. This I say is a confessed truth with the most learned of the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> Amongst whom it is a rule for the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of many and many places of Scripture. <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitur Lex secundùm linguam filiorum hominum,</hi> that is, <hi>That the Law speaks according to the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the sonnes of men:</hi> as <hi>Moses AEgyptius</hi> can tell you. And it will be worth our labour now to instance in some passages.</p>
                        <p>Gen. 19. v. 23. <hi>The sunne was risen upon the Earth when Lot entred into Zoar.</hi> Which implies, that it
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:115239:121"/>
was before under the Earth: Which is true onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to sense, and vulgar fancy.</p>
                        <p>Deuteronom. 30. v. 4. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>; Implies that the earth is bounded at certain places, as if there were truly an <hi>Hercules</hi> Pillar, or <hi>Non plus ultrá:</hi> As it is manifest to them, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand but the naturall signification of <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>. For those words plainly import the Earth bounded by the blue Heavens, and the Heavens bounded by the Horizon of the Earth: they touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another mutually. Which is true onely to sense and in appearance, as any man that is not a meer Idiot will confesse.</p>
                        <p>Ecclesiastic. cap. 27. v. 12. <hi>The discourse of a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man is alwayes with wisdome, but a fool changeth as the moon.</hi> That's to be understood according to sense and appearance. For if a fool changeth no more then the Moon doth really, he is a wise and excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accomplished man, <hi>Semper idem,</hi> though to the sight of the vulgar different. For at least an Hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphear of the Moon is alwayes enlightned, and even then most, when she least appears to us.</p>
                        <p>Hitherto may be referr'd also that, 2. Chron. 4. 2. <hi>Also he made a molten Sea of ten Cubits from brim <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>o brim round in compasse, and five Cubits the height thereof, and a line of thirty Cubits did compasse it round about.</hi> A thing plainly impossible that the Diameter should be ten Cubits and the Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence but thirty. But it pleaseth the Spirit of God here to speak according to the common use and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Men, and not according to the subtilty of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chimedes</hi> his demonstration.</p>
                        <p>Again Psalme 19. <hi>In them hath he set a taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle for the Sunne, which as a bridegroom cometh out of his chamber, and rejoyceth as a strong man to

runne his race.</hi> This, as Mr. <hi>Iohn Calvin</hi> observes, is spoken according to the rude apprehension of the Vulgar, whom <hi>David</hi> should in vain have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to teach the mysteries of Astronomy.
<q>Haec ratio est <hi>(saith he)</hi> cur dicat tentorium ei paratum esse, deinde egredi ipsum ab una coeli extremitate, &amp; transire celeriter ad partem oppositam; Neque enim argutè inter Philosophos de integro solis circuitu dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putat, sed rudissimis quibusque se accommodans, intra ocularem experientiam se continet; ideoque dimidiam cursûs partem quae sub Hemisphario nostro non cerni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, subticet. <hi>i. e.</hi> This is the reason, to wit, the rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the vulgar, why the Psalmist saith there is a tent prepared for the Sunne, and then that he goes from one end of the heaven and passes swiftly to the other: For he doth not here subtily dispute amongst the Philosophers of the intire circuit of the Sunne, but accommodating himself to the capacity of every igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant man, contains himself within ocular experience; and therefore saith nothing of the other part of the course of the sun, which is not to be seen as being under our Hemisphear.</q>
Thus M. Calvin.</p>
                        <p>I'le adde but one instance more, <hi>Ioshua</hi> 10. v. 12. <hi>Sunne stand thou still upon Gibeon, and thou Moon in the valley of Ajalon.</hi> Where it is manifest that <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shua</hi> speaks not according to the Astronomicall truth of the thing but according to sense and appearance. For suppose the Sunne placed and the Moon at the best advantage you can so that they leave not their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall course, they were so farre farre from being one over <hi>Ajalon</hi> and the other over <hi>Gibeon,</hi> that they were in very truth many hundreds of miles distant from them. And if the Sun and Moon were on the other side of the <hi>Equatour,</hi> the distance might amount to thousands.</p>

                           <pb n="225" facs="tcp:115239:122"/>I might adjoyn to these proofs the suffrages of many Fathers and Modern Divines, as <hi>Chrysostome, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose, Augustine, Bernard, Aquinas,</hi> &amp;c. But 'tis already manifest enough that the Scripture speaks not according to the exact curiosity of truth, describing things <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>And thus having made good the first part of my promise, I proceed to the second; which was to shew, That the Extent of the world is to be bounded no higher then the clouds, or there abouts, that it may thence appear, that the upper waters mentioned in <hi>Moses,</hi> are the same with those <hi>Aquae in coelo stantes</hi> mentioned by <hi>Pliny, lib.</hi> 31. his words are these, <hi>Quid esse mirabilius potest aquis in coelo stantibus?</hi> and these waters can be nothing else, but that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the clouds, which descends in rain; and so the whole Creation will be contain'd within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of the Aire, which the Hebrews call <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>ibi aquae:</hi> because it is <hi>sedes nubium,</hi> the place of clouds and rain.

First, because the clouds are made the place of Gods abode; whence we are to suppose them plac'd with the highest. There he lives, and runnes, and rides, and walks. <hi>He came walking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wings of the wind,</hi> in the 104.

waters, to wit, the upper waters which are the clouds. The Almighties lodgings therefore according to the letter, are placed in the clouds. Thereabout also is his field for exercise and warre, Deut. 33. 26. <hi>There is none like to the God of Ieshurun, who rideth upon the Heavens for thy help in his excellency on the skie,</hi> that is, upon the upper clouds, as <hi>Buxtorf</hi> interprets it, and indeed what can <gap reason="foreign">

And this agrees well with that of <hi>Nahum,</hi> chap. 1. v. 3. <hi>The Lord hath his way in the whirlwind, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.</hi> Here he is running as swift as a whirlwind, and raiseth a dust of clouds about him. You shall find him riding again, <hi>Psalme</hi> 68. 4. and that in triumph; but yet but on the clouds: sutably to that in <hi>Deut.

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:115239:123"/>
but <hi>thunder</hi>? and whence is thunder but out of the clouds? and where then doth God ride but on the clouds? The following verse makes all plain: <hi>Ascribe ye strength unto God; His excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds,</hi> which doth nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly confirm, that the Extent of the Heavens, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the letter of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>David</hi> too, are but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the height of the clouds. For here the heaven of heavens is the seat of thunder, and Gods strength and power is said to be in the clouds. Nor doth this expression of this height, to wit, <hi>the heaven of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens of old,</hi> imply any distance higher. For sith all the Firmament from the lower to the upper waters is called Heaven; it is not a whit unreasonable that the highest part of this Heaven or Firmament, be called the Heaven of Heavens. And this is my first argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the heaven or firmaments Extent is but from the Sea to the Clouds, because God is sea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <p>My second argument is taken from the adjoyning the <hi>heavens</hi> with the <hi>clouds</hi> exegetically, one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the setting out of that which is exceeding high as high as we can expresse. And this the Psalmist doth often, <hi>Psalme</hi> 36. 5. <hi>Thy mercy, O Lord, is in the Heavens, and thy faithfulnesse reacheth unto the Cloud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>My last argument is from the Psalmists placing the Sunne, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:115239:124"/>
both from Testimony, and might also from the Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of the word. For <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> signifies <hi>comminuere, contundere, to beat to dust</hi>: and what are clouds but the dust of heaven, as I may so speak. <hi>Psalme</hi> 89. <hi>v.</hi> 36, 37. <hi>His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the Sunne before me. It shall be established for ever as the Moon, and as the faithfull witnesse <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap> in heaven</hi>: that is, in the sky, the place where the clouds are. The drawing down therefore of the Sun, that faithfull witnesse in heaven, so low as the clouds, implies that the letter of the Scripture takes no notice of any considerable part of the firmament above the clouds, it terminating its expressions alwayes at that Extent. And this sutes very well with <hi>Moses</hi> his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Sun and the Moon the <hi>great lights,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king nothing as it were of the starres, as is manifest out of the 16 verse of the first of <hi>Genesis. And God made two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesse to rule the night; He made the stars also.</hi> But they come as cast into the bargain, as not so considerable, when as indeed a Starre of the first magnitude is (according to the calculation of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomers) twenty thousand times bigger then the earth, and the earth five and fourty times bigger then the Moon; so that one starre of the first magnitude will prove about nine hundred thousand times bigger then the Moon. Which notwithstanding, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the letter of <hi>Moses,</hi> is one of the two great lights, the sole Empresse of the night. But here the letter of <hi>Moses</hi> is very consistent with it self. For sith that the Extent of heaven is not acknowledged any higher then the clouds, or thereabout wherein, (as I shewed you) the Sun is, and consequently the Moon, aud it will not be more harsh to mak the stars stoop so low too; nay, they must indeed of necessity
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:115239:124"/>
all of them be so low, they having no where else to be higher, according to the usuall phrase of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) the appearances of the starres will then to our sight sufficiently set out their proportions one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the Sun and the Moon (according to this Hypothesis) will prove the two great lights, and the starres but scatter'd sky-pebbles. Wherefore from all this harmony and correspondency of things, I think I may safely conclude, that the Extent of the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to <hi>Moses,</hi> is but the distance from the sea to the clouds, or thereabouts, as well as it is to our sight, which cannot discern any intervall of alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes betwixt the clouds and the Moon, the Moon and the Sunne, and lastly, betwixt the Sunne and the fixed Starres. Which interpretation I am confident any man will admit of, that can bring down the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of his Philosophick fancy unto a vulgar consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stency, and fit compliance with the sweetnesse and sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of <hi>Moses</hi> his style.</p>
                        <p>And thus, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> have I proved that there is no room for thy interstellar waters within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe of <hi>Moses</hi> his Creation, unlesse they run into one, and mingle with the rain or clouds.</p>

I will not let thee go till I have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thee to an account for thy great bull of Basan as thou wouldst call it. Thou sayest, <hi>That the Epicycles of</hi> Ptolomy <hi>though they are too bigge to be true, yet that they are very diminutive things in respect of their orbs that sustain them; as little and diminutive as mites in a cheese in respect of the cheese.</hi> To speak the most favourably of this assertion of thine that may be, it is sublime <hi>Astronomicall</hi> Nonsense. And if we could find any Nonsense sublunary to parallel it, it would be some such stuff as this: Although the cannon bullets in the tower be as bigge as mount <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thos,</hi> yet they are so little that they will not fill the compasse of a walnut. This is a bundle of falsities and so is that. That is, Both the parts of these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Axioms are false, and the composition it self also illegitimate. These are <hi>Discrete</hi> Axioms, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius,</hi> and both the parts ought to be true, but they are both false here. And there ought also, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly these notes <hi>Quamvis</hi> and <hi>tamen</hi> being in them, to be onely a <hi>Discretion</hi> of parts, but here is an impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Opposition: things put together that imply a contradiction. In the latter of these Axioms it is manifest; but I will shew you, it is so also, in that former of yours.</p>
                        <p>For first, the <hi>Epicyoles</hi> of <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> are not too bigge to be true. For they do not suppose them big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then will be contained within the thicknesse of their own orbs. And you your self say that they are but as mites in a cheese in respect of their orbs. So that it is plain according to what you your self grant, as well as according to the <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis</hi>
                           <pb n="232" facs="tcp:115239:126"/>
of <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> that they are not too bigge to be true.</p>
                        <p>But secondly, I say they are not as little as Mites in respect of the cheese they are in. For the semi-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter of <hi>Saturns Epicycle</hi> is to the semi-diameter of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s Eccentrick, at least as 1 to 10. and the semi-dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of <hi>Iupiters Epicycle</hi> to the semi-diameter of his Eccentrick more then as 1 to 6. but <hi>Mars</hi> his as 2 to 3, or thereabout, and the semidiameter of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picycle of <hi>Venus</hi> to the semidiameter of her eccen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick more then as 2 to 3 by a good deal. And is it not plain hence <hi>Eugenius,</hi> that thy mite in a cheese must swell up at least to the bignesse of a Mouse in a cheese, though thy cheese were almost as little as a trundle bed wheel, or a box of Marmalade? and what a vast difference is there betwixt a Mite and a Mouse, but thy ignorance emboldens thee to speak any thing.</p>
                        <p>But now in the last place, the putting these two fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities together is contradiction, as well as they are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally false. For it is evident, that if the <hi>Epicycles</hi> be too bigge to be true, they cannot be so little as Mites in a cheese, in respect of their orbs. For then would they be easily contain'd within the <hi>crassities</hi> or thicknesse of their orbs. But their not being able to be contained within the <hi>Crassities</hi> of their orbs, that's the thing that must make them too bigge to be true.</p>
                        <p>And questionlesse if we will joyn the <hi>Epicycle</hi> with its right office, which is to bring down the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net to its lowest <hi>Perigee,</hi> then the <hi>Epicycles</hi> of the planets will be too bigge to be true. For there will be of them that are half as big again as their <hi>Deferents,</hi> nay five times if not ten times as big. And of these <hi>Epicycles</hi> I said (and <hi>Ptolemies</hi> ought to have been
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:115239:126"/>
such, unlesse they did desert their office) that they were too bigge to be true. But thou pronouncest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning these things thou knowst not what, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore art easily tost up and down like a shittle cock thou knowst not whither, How do I blow thee about as the dust or the down of thistles?</p>

a Contradiction, for in Rarefaction and Conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation there is the generation or deperdition of no new Matter, but all matter hath impenetrable dimensions.

What thou alledgest of the rarefaction of water into clouds or vapours, is nothing to the purpose.

                           <hi>Bid adiew to thy reputation Mastix.</hi> Well, now I perceive that thou thinkest that thou hast hit the nail on the head indeed: But all that thou dost or canst collect from what is in my Preface to the Canto <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the sleep of the Soul,</hi> is but this: that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we see or imagine, that both of these are but the very <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It doth not thence follow that the inward and outward sense is all one, but onely <hi>unitate genericâ.</hi> no more then if I should say, that to be an <hi>Animal</hi> is but to have, corporeall substance, life, and sense, it would thence follow that an horse and a man are all one. Look thee now, <hi>Magicus,</hi> how I have passed through this huge Mound and Bulwark of thine, with as much ease and stilnesse as a gliding Spirit through a Mud-wall. I will onely look back and laugh at thee <hi>Magicus,</hi> for a man of no Logick. But if any man doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou saist blind men see in their sleep, it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thou doest. For in thy <hi>Anthroposophia, Page</hi> 40. <hi>line</hi> 1. thou saist, <hi>That the visible power is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyd as is plain in the dreams of blind men.</hi> Here if thou knowst what thou saist, thou arguest from the effect to the cause, from the operation to the faculty, but is the <hi>operation</hi> of the <hi>Visive</hi> faculty (for thou dost barbarously call it <hi>visible</hi>) any thing else but <hi>seeing?</hi> therefore thou dost plainly assert that blind men see in their sleep. It would be well if they could walk in their sleep too: for then they would scarce have any losse of their eyes.</p>

For when two men discourse, that in them that reasons, hears the words, and sees the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with whom it reasoneth, does it not? Therefore they both see the object: But you will say, One sees by a <hi>species,</hi> the other without. I say nothing can be discerned without a <hi>species,</hi> that is, without an actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all representation of the thing discerned: So that that distinction is in vain. And I would adde this further, That every <hi>sentient spirit</hi> must perceive by its own <hi>species,</hi> and not by anothers. But thou sayest, This sensitive Spirit like a glasse represents the <hi>species</hi> of externall objects. Then it seems the Sensitive spirits office is to be the glasse of the Soul to see things in; but glasses themselves, <hi>Magicus,</hi> are not <hi>sentient,</hi> nor
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115239:133"/>
need this Spirit be so, that is the souls glasse; and it is plain it is not. For if these two were two different sensitive spirits, then they would have two different <hi>Animadversions</hi>; but there is but one <hi>Animadversive</hi> spirit in a man, and therefore but one Sensitve. And that there is but one <hi>Animadversive</hi> spirit in a Man, is plain from hence, that if the Rationall <hi>animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive</hi> bestow its animadversion fully elsewhere, the Sensitive in man cannot perform the thousandth part of that which is performed in brutes. We should lose our selves in the most triviall matters, when not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this sensitive spirit in man would have as quick a vehicle as in most brutes. Besides, this Sensitive spirit having this animadversion, would have also a Memory apart, and would be able while the Rationall is busied about something else, to lay up ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations such as Beasts do by it self; and then long after to shew them to the Rationall, to its sudden a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement and astonishment. But none of these things are. And in my apprehension it is in a very grosse and palpable way sensible to me, that there is but one <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadversive</hi> in me, and I think I am no monster; If I be, it is (it seems) in that I am all rationall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and have had the luck to misse of the sensitive, the beast.</p>

To this you answer, Ha ha he! A very profound answer. This is no laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter, my friend.

are different, and the senses are different, that is taken a way already. For the sting of my Argument is not this, that there would be two sensitive souls of the same nature in the body of a man; but that there should be two sensitive souls at all. And indeed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that the superiour soul contains the faculties of the inferiour, it is altogether needlesse.

<pb n="261" facs="tcp:115239:140"/>
very willingly grant thee a mere body without a soul, thou hast so little reason and sense in thee; or if thou hast a soul, that it is a corporeall one, and it may well be so: But my question is meant of souls that have Sense and Reason in them, whether they be corpore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all substances or no? Yes, say you, they are. They are <hi>intelligent Fire and Light.</hi> I say, <hi>Phil.</hi> thou art all fire, but no light, nor intelligent at all. Thou art the hottest fellow that ever I met with in all my dayes, as hot as a Taylours Goose when it hisseth, and yet as dark. But let's endeavour (if it be possible) to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie thy opake carcase, and transmit a little light into th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>e. Doest thou know then what fire is? how it is a very fluid body, whose particles rest not one by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, but fridge one against another, being very swiftly and variously agitated. In this condition is the matter of fire. But now I demand of thee; Is there any substance in this fire thou speakest of, (for thou sayest it is really fire, and usest no Metaphor) which we may call the essentiall Form thereof, or no? If there be, I ask thee whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>her that Form be Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent or no? If it be, then that is the soul, and this subtile agitated matter is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ut the vehicle. But if thou wilt say, that the subtile fiery matter is the Intelligent Soul, see what inconveniencies thou intanglest thy self in. For Fire being as <hi>homogeneall</hi> a body as water is, and having all the parts much what alike agitated; how can this fire do those offices that commonly are attributed to the soul? First, how can it organize the body into so wise a structure and contrivement, the parts of this fire tending as much this way as that way, or at least tending onely one way, suppose up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Secondly, how can it inform the whole body of an <hi>Embryo</hi> in the wombe, and of a grown man? For if it was but big enough for the first, it will be too
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:115239:141"/>
little for the latter; unlesse you suppose it to grow, and to be nourished. But thus, you will not have the same Indiuiduall Soul you was Christened with, and must be forced to turn not onely <hi>Independent,</hi> but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptist,</hi> that your new soul may be baptized; for it is not now the same that you was Christened with before. For I say, that ten spoonfulls of water added to one should rather individuate the whole, then that one of that whole number should individuate the ten. Thirdly, how can it move it self, or the body in a spontaneous way? For all the particles of this fiery matter wriggling and playing on their own centers, or joyntly endeavouring to tend upwards, makes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to a spontaneous motion, no more then the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of dust that are seen playing in the Sun beams, striking through a chink of a wall into a dark room, can conspire into one spontaneous motion, and go which way they please.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore I say, there ought to be some superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent Form that takes hold of all these fiery particles and commands them as one body, and guides them this way or that way, and must be the <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>Soul</hi>? not the indument, the smock or peticote of the Soul as thou call'st it. <hi>Eugenius,</hi> thou art old excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent at finding out naked essences, it seems, that takest the garment for the body. Thou art so young that thou canst not distinguish betwixt a living barn, and a baby made of clouts. But this is not all that I have to say <hi>Phil.</hi> Fourthly, I say that this Fire cannot be the
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:115239:141"/>
Soul, because fire is devoid of sense. I but you say you understand an <hi>Intelligent fire.</hi> Learnedly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, and to as much purpose as if you should say, that a Soul is a Post or a Pillar, and then you should distinguish and tell me; you meant an Intelligent Post or Pillar, but I say Fire hath no more sense then a Post or Pillar has reason. For if it have sense, it must have that which the Schools call <hi>Sensus communis.</hi> And now tell me <hi>Phil,</hi> to which of all the playing particles of this <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> of thine thou wilt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the office of the <hi>Sensus communis,</hi> or why to any one more then to the rest? But if thou appoint all, there will be as many severall sensations, as there are particles: Indeed so many distinct living things. And thou wilt become more numerous within, then the possessed in the Gospel, whose name was <hi>Legion,</hi> because they were many. But if thou wilt pitch upon any one particle above the rest, tell me where it is? In the middle or at the out-side of this fire? I will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret thee the most favourably, and answer for thee; In the middle. But I demand of thee, Why shall this in the middle have the priviledge of being the <hi>Sensus Communis</hi> rather then any other, or how will it be able to keep it self in the middle in so fluid a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? And if it were kept there, what priviledge hath it but what the most of the rest have, as well as it, to make it fit for the office of a <hi>Sensus Communis?</hi> For it must be, either because it is otherwise moved on its Center, then the other are on theirs, which you can not prove either to be, or if it were, to be to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: Or it must be, because it hath some advantage in consideration of the joynt motion of the particles. Let the joynt motion therefore of the particles be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>rectilinear</hi> or <hi>circular.</hi> If <hi>rectilinear,</hi> as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in a square, let the processe of motion be from
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:115239:142"/>
side to side parallel. Hath not then any particle in a right line that is drawn through the center of this Square figure, parallel to two of the sides, equal advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for this office (the transmission of outward sense being perpendicular to the said right line) that the middle particle hath? For thus it can receive but what comes in one line, transmission of sense being parallel, as is supposed. Nay, the points of any other inward line parallel to this, will do as well as the points of this middle line, which is as plainly true, as two and two is four, if thou understandest sense when it is propounded to thee. Well, but it may be you may think you can mend your self by supposing the joynt motion of this fiery matter to be <hi>circular.</hi> I say no. For then that of this motion, that respects externall objects is from the Center to the Circumference, as it is plain in that ordinary experiment of a Sling. And thus motion is from the middle particle, not towards it. But you should say here, if you could answer so wisely, that motion bearing forward from this center toward the object, that reciprocally the object will bear against it; and so there will be a transmission of sense round about from all the circumferentiall parts of this fiery Orb which thou calledst the naked soul. But I say, <hi>Magicus,</hi> if the middle point of this Orb get the place of the <hi>Sensus Communis,</hi> because there is a common transmission of motion from sensible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects thereunto: I say then that there be more <hi>Sensus Communes</hi> in this Orb then One, because such trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions as are not perpendicular to this Orb, will meet in severall points distant from the middle point or center of this Orb, and there are enough such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall transmissions as these. I might adde also, that the middle point or particle being though a minute one, yet a body, and consequently divisible, that that
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:115239:142"/>
will also bid fair for a multiplicity of <hi>Common Senses.</hi> But I will adde onely this, That I hope to see the day wherein thou wilt be so wise as to be able to confesse, that the Authour of <hi>Anthroposophia Theomagica,</hi> &amp;c. was the most confident <hi>Ignaro</hi> that ever wet pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per with ink. But before I leave this fourth argument, let me onely cast in one thing more which equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects both Hypotheses, either of <hi>rectilinear</hi> or <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> motion. And that's this, If any one particle of this fiery substance be the <hi>Common sense,</hi> it must be also the principle of spontaneous motion to the whole substance. For we see plainly that that which hath the <hi>Animadversive</hi> faculty in man, or the office of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense,</hi> moves the whole man, or that the motion of him is directed at the beck of this. But I prethee <hi>Phil,</hi> tell me if thou canst possibly imagine, that any one particle in this fiery substance should be able to impresse spontaneous Motion upon the whole; I know thou canst not but think it impossible. Fifthly, if the Soul be fire (fire being so fluid and unsteddy a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance) how can there be any memory in it? You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that expression in <hi>Catullus,</hi> whereby he would set forth sudden obl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>teration and forgetfulness of things, that it is like writing in the Water or in the Aire,
<q>
                              <l>In vento aut rapidâ scribere oportet aquâ.</l>
                           </q>
But what think you of fire then, will that consisten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy bear more durable characters? The perpetuall fridging and toying of the fiery particles dorh forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with cancell whatever is impressed, and now there is neither <hi>Common sense</hi> nor <hi>Memory</hi> to be found in your fire, we may be secure there is no <hi>Reason</hi> to be found there. For the Discursive Faculty requires some <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, something fixt to tread upon as well as the Progressive: But in your fire all is aflote, nothing fixt.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:115239:143"/>
Sixthly and lastly, If the Soul of man be either fire or aire, or both, I do not see that it will prove <hi>immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall</hi>; but that its consistency will be dispersed and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered like the clouds. It will not be able to conflict with the boistrous winds, or scape blowing out, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lost in the thinne aire, as other flames are, it once being uncased of the armature of the body. And these Vehicles which you will have to be the very Soul it self, they being so changeable and passive within the body, it will not be absurd with <hi>Lucretius</hi> to inferre that they will be utterly dissolved when they are without:

                              <l>This shelter lost, how can they then sustain</l>
                              <l>The strong assaults of stormy winds that blow?</l>
                           </q>
I tell thee <hi>Phil,</hi> such a Soul as thou fanciest would be no more able to withstand the winds, then the dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable clouds, nor to understand any more sense then a Soul of clouts, or thy own Soul doth.</p>
                        <p>But now I have so fully confuted thy grosse opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Soul, it may be happily expected that I would declare mine own. But <hi>Phil,</hi> I onely will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare so much, that I do not look on the Soul as a <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripateticall atome,</hi> but as on a spirituall substance, without corporeall dimensions, but not destitute of an immateriall amplitude of Essence, dilatable and contractible. But for further satisfaction in this point, I referre to my <hi>Philosophicall Poems.</hi> And do professe that I have as distinct, determinate, and clear appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:115239:143"/>
of these things, and as wary and coherent, as I have of any corporeall thing in the world. But Heat and Fantastry to suddled minds are as good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions as Caution and Reason to the sober. But the durablenesse of that satisfaction is uncertain, whereas solid Reason is lasting and immutable.</p>

                           <hi>MY Book also informes you that this Descent of light proceeds not from any weight, but from a similitude and Symbole of Nature.</hi> You are indeed very good at similitudes <hi>Phil.</hi> as I have proved here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore out of your skill in <hi>Zoography.</hi> But this is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther businesse. For here you professe to speak of the symbolizing and sympathizing of things one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in Nature, and so mutually moving to union, by a kind of attractive power, according to that saying
<q>
                              <l>

Well be it so that there is a mutuall attractive power in things that symbolize one with another (for the attraction is mutuall as well as the similitude mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all) What is this to take away what I have objected? Nothing. But I will shew you how you are hang'd in your own chain. For it is as plain, as one of the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, that where two things of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture act, the greater is stronger, and the stronger pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails. Wherefore three portions of light should fetch up two, or five one; rather then one should fetch down three, or five, or two. This is the bare point of my reason which I covered with a double compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison. <hi>viz.</hi> from the greater number of the lincks of a Chain preponderating the lesse number, and from the greater portion of Earth prevailing over the lesse; as in that instance, when a clod taken from the earth and let go in the free aire, the earth commands it back to it self again, according to that conceit of <hi>Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</hi> And here the argument was <hi>à pari,</hi> not <hi>à specie,</hi> and there may be a collation of parity even in contraries. And your ignorance of that Logicall Notion, hath inabled you to rayl so much, and speak so little to the purpose on this Observation, as any <hi>Logician</hi> may very easily discern.</p>

                           <hi>Page</hi> 103. <hi>line</hi> 14. <hi>Answer if thou darest to any one of these Questions.</hi> Assure thy self, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> I can give a very rationall answer to every one of them. But for thy sake I think fit to answer none of them. But what is in my <hi>Philosophicall Poems</hi> will salve them all.</p>
                        <p>I will now rather examine what force of Arguments you have to prove that that which orders Matter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:115239:144"/>
shape and form, is <hi>Animadversive</hi> and <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Your first Argument is; that if there were no A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadversion in the <hi>Ratio Seminalis,</hi> (or call it what you will) that shapes the Matter into Form, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent would mistake in his work.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, That he would work he knew not what, nor wherefore, and that therefore all Generations would be blind Casualties.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, there would not be that Method, infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Action nor proportion and Symmetry of parts in the work.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly and Lastly, That there would be no End nor Impulsive cause to make him to work.</p>
                        <p>To all these unsound Reasons, I have already an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered very solidly and truly; That the force of them reached no further then thus: That the <hi>Ratio Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis</hi> must at least proceed from something that is knowing, and be in some sense Rationall, but not have reason and animadversion in it self. And this is the opinion of <hi>Plotinus, Marsilius Ficinus,</hi> and all the Platonists that I have met with. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>&amp;c. Ennead.</hi> 2. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. To this sense. <hi>For the</hi> Ratio Seminalis <hi>acts in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and that which acts thus naturally, neither under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands nor sees, but hath onely a power to transform the Matter, not knowing any thing, but making onely as it were a form or shape in the water.</hi> And <hi>Ficinus</hi> compares this <hi>Ratio Seminalis,</hi> to an Artifice cut off from the mind of the Artificer and made self-sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent, and able to work upon prepared matter, but without knowledge, as being disjoyned from all ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madversive essence. This is the right notion of the <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:115239:145"/>
And this fully takes away the force of all your Arguments. For these being <hi>divine art</hi> imbodied in Nature and Matter, and working natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, they will</p>
                        <p>First, Mistake no more, then a Stone will in its journey downwards, or the Fire in its course upward; which go alwayes right, if no externall obstacle hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them. And these will work right, if the Matter be duly prepared.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Though they work they know not what, yet they work right in virtue of that cause from whence they came, the <hi>divine Intellect</hi>: and their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration is no more casuall then the ascent of Fire, and descent of Earth; for it is naturall.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, This third falls in with the second, and the same answer will serve both.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, There is an Impulsive cause and End of their working, though unknown to them, yet not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the Authour of them. As in the orderly motion of a Watch the Spring knows not the end of its Motion, but the Artificer doth. Yet the watch moves, and orderly too, and to a good End. But this fourth falls in also with the second or first. And you see now that they are indeed all fallen to nothing at all. So easily is Confidence overcome when unbacked with solid Reason.</p>

                        </gap> one tittle of this truth shall passe away. High and windy Notions do but blow up and kindle more fiercely the fire of Hel in the hearts of men, from whence is Pride, and Contention, and bitter Zeal. This is the pest and plague of Mankind, and the succeeding torture of the sons of <hi>Adam.</hi> For while the mind of man catcheth at high things, of which she is uncapable till she be refined and purged, she doth but fire the frame of her little world by her overbusie Motion, which burning in grosse fewel, fills all with smoke. And thus the Soul is even smothered and stifled in her narrow mansion. Her first enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here must therefore be, by <hi>Temperance</hi> and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemiousnesse: For without this breathing-hole for fresh aire, Devotion it self will choak her still more and more, heating her thick and polluted spirits in such sort, that they cannot be sufficiently rectified by the power of the brain. But in this <hi>Dispensation</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially is lodged a strong voice, weak sense, and a rude contempt of any thing that will trouble the head, as Reason, Philosophy, or any but ordinary subtilty in learning. But they love Christ very hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after their grosse way, as their Protectour and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curer from what outward evil naturally attends so bad an inward condition. But being so immersed in brutish sense, and yet with conscience of sinne; if any
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:115239:149"/>
body have but the trick to perswade them that Sinne is but a name, he will be a very welcome Apostle to them, and they will find more ease to their beastly nature, in fancying nothing to be sinne, then they did in making their Hypocriticall addresses to an offended Saviour. And then (poore souls) through the foul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the flesh, are they easily inveigled into A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theisme it self. In so great danger are we of the most mischievous miscarriages, by contemning of tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> known and confessed virtues of Temperance, Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, and Chastity.</p>
                     <p>But we'le suppose Men in a great measure <hi>tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>; yet how farre off are they still from reall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse in themselves, or from not disturbing the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse of others, so long as <hi>Envy, Ambition, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse,</hi> and <hi>Self-respect</hi> doth still lodge in them? Here indeed Reason may happily get a little more el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow-room; but it will be but to be Patron to those vices, and to make good by Argument harsh opinions of God, and peremptorily to conclude the power of Christ weaker then the force of sinne. And the Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in these something more refined Spirits, will be more easily figurable into various conceits, but very little to the purpose. Of which some must go for so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Truths, and those that are more fully shining, in the midst of a shadowy Melancholiz'd imagination, must bid fair for Diuine Inspiration, though neither Miracle nor Reason countenance them. But you, O men of <hi>Ephesus</hi>! if any one tell you strange devises, and forbid you the use of your Reason, or the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of a Miracle; you will be so wise as to look upon him as one that would bid you wink with your eyes, that he might the more easily give you a box of the Eare, or put his hand into your Pockets.</p>
                     <p>Now out of this <hi>Second Dispensation,</hi> innumerable
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:115239:149"/>
swarms of Sects rise in all the world. For Falsehood and Imagination is infinite, but Truth is one. And the benignitie of the Divine Spirit, having no harbour in all this varietie of religious Pageantry; <hi>Envy, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse,</hi> and <hi>Ambition</hi> must needs make them bustle, and tear all the word in pieces, if the hand of Providence did not hold them in some limits:
<q>
                           <l>Quin laniant mundum; tanta est discordia fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum:</l>
                        </q>
as he saith of the winds. In this <hi>Dispensation</hi> lodgeth Anger and active Zeal concerning Opinions and Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, Uncertainty and Anxiety touching the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses of God, and a rigid injudicious Austerity, of which little comes but the frighting men off from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: which notwithstanding if it be had in the truth thereof, is the most chearfull and lovely thing in the world. These men having not reached to the <hi>Second Covenant,</hi> will also thank any body that could release them from the <hi>First,</hi> For whereas true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is the great joy and delight of them that attain to it, theirs is but their burden. And so it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that these may be also wound off to the depth of wickednesse, and sink also in time even to Atheisme it self. For what is <hi>reall</hi> in them will work, but what is <hi>imaginary</hi> will prove it self ineffectuall. Wherefore, is it not farre better for men to busie all their strength in destroying those things which are so evidently destructive of humane felicity, then to edge their spirits with fiery notions and strange Fantasmes, which pretend indeed to the semblance of deep my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious knowledge and divine speculation; but do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hinder but that the <hi>black dog</hi> may be at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, as I said before?</p>
                     <p>But you will ask me, How shall we be rid of the Importunity of the impostures and fooleries of this
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:115239:150"/>
Second Dispensation. But I demand of you, Is there any way imaginable but this? <hi>viz. To adhere to those things that are uncontrovertedly good and true, and to bestow all that zeal, and all that heat, and all that pains for the acquiring of the simplicity of the life of God, that we do in promoting our own Interest, or needlesse and doubtfull Opinions.</hi> And I think it is without controversie true to any that are not degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate below men, that Temperance is better then In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, Justice then Injustice; Humility then Pride, Love then Hatred, and Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>cifulnesse then Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty. It is also uncontrovertedly true, that God loves his own Image, and that the propagation of it is the most true dispreading of his glory; as the Light which is the Image of the Sunne, is the glory of the Sunne. Wherefore it is as plainly true, that God is as well willing, as able to restore this Image in men, that his glory may shine in the world. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the true Faith, to believe that by the power of God in Christ we may reach to the <hi>participation of Divine Nature</hi>: Which is a simple, mild, benigne light, that seeks nothing for it self as it self; but doth tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and cordially endeavour the good of All, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyceth in the good of All, and will assuredly meet them that keep close to what they plainly in their consciences are convinced is the leading to it. And I say, that sober Morality, conscienciously kept to, is like the morning light reflected from the higher clouds, and a certain Prodrome of the Sunne of Righteousnesse it self. But when he is risen above the <hi>Horizon,</hi> the same virtues then stream immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from his visible body, and they are the very <hi>members of Christ</hi> according to the Spirit. And he that is come hither, is <hi>a pillar in the Temple of God</hi> for ever and ever; for he teacheth the Second Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:115239:150"/>
whic he can in no more likelihood break, then lay violent hands on himself to the taking away of his naturall life. Nay, that will be farre more easie then this; for a man may kill himself in a trice, but he cannot extinguish this Divine life without long and miserable torture. If this be to be a Puritane, <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius,</hi> I am a Puritane. But I must tell thee, that by how much more a man precisely takes this way, the more <hi>Independent</hi> he will prove. And the pure simplicity of the life of God revealed in <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> will shine with so amiable a lustre in his inward mind, that all the most valuable Opinions that are contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted amongst Churches and Sects, will seem no more comely then a Fools coat compared with the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Splendour of the Sunne. But if thou meanest by either <hi>Puritane</hi> or <hi>Independent,</hi> one in the second Dispensation, I should dissemble in the presence of Heaven, if I should not say I am above them; as I am above all Sects whatsoever as Sects. For I am a true and free <hi>Christian</hi>; and what I write and speak is for the Interest of Christ, and in the behalf of the <hi>life of the Lamb</hi> which is contemned. And his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest is the Interest of the sonnes of men; for he hath no Interest but their good and welfare. But because they will not have him to rule, the Nations of the world (by a Divine <hi>Nemesis</hi>) are given up into the hands of Wolves, Foxes, and Lions: <hi>The earth is full of darknesse and cruell habitations.</hi> Wherefore, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> thou doest very unskilfully, in endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to tumble me off from the <hi>Independents,</hi> to cast me amongst the <hi>Puritanes,</hi> as thou callest them. For it is not in thy power to cast me so low as any Sect whatsoever; God hath placed me in a Dispensation above them, and wilt thou throw me down? No, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> I shine upon them both as the Sunne in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament,
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:115239:151"/>
who doth not wink on one side, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his Rayes, but looks openly upon all, impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing warmth and light. Thou hast encountred with a <hi>Colosse</hi> indeed (though thou callest me so but in sport and scorn) farre bigger then that stradling Statue at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> and that reacheth far higher. And yet no Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue neither, but one that will speak what nothing but Ignorance and Hypocrisie can deny. Wherefore with my feet wading amidst the Sects of the earth and with my head stooping down out of the Clouds, I will venture to trie the world with this sober question. Tell me therefore, O all ye Nations, People, and Kindreds of the earth, what is the reason that the world is such a stage of misery to the Sonnes of Men? Is it not from hence, That that which should be their great Guidance, their Religion and highest Lights of their minds, is but Heat and squabbling about subtile uncertain points, and foolish affectation of high my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries; while the uncontroverted sober truths of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Piety are neglected, and the simplicity of the life of God despised, as a most contemptible thing. And I had no sooner uttered these words in my mind, but me thought I heard an Answer from all the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the World, from East, West, North and South, like the noise of many waters, or the voice of Thunder, saying, <hi>Amen. Halelujah.</hi> This is true.</p>
                     <p>Nor is this any vain Enthusiasme, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> but the triumph of the Divine Light in my Rationall Spirit, striking out to my exteriour faculties, my Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and Sense. For my head was so filled with the noise, that it felt to me as bound and straitened, as being not able to contain it, and coldnesse and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling seised upon my flesh. But you will say, All this is but a triviall Truth that you are so zealous and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:115239:151"/>
in. But verily, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> is it not better to be zealous about those things that are plainly true, then those that are either uncertain or false? 'Tis true, what I have said to thy soaring minde may seem contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible. But if thou once hadst the sight of that Principle from whence it came, thou wouldest be suddenly asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of that patched clothing of thy soul, stitch'd up of so many unfutable and heedlesse sigurations of thy unpurged fancy, and wouldst endeavour to put on that <hi>simple uniform light.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And now, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> that I find my self in an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious temper to conuerse with thee, come a little nearer me, or rather I will come a little nearer to thee. Hitherto I have play'd the part of a <hi>personated Enemy</hi> with thee, give me leave now to do the office of an <hi>open Friend.</hi> I perceive there is in you, as you have made it manifest to all the world, an eager desire after Knowledge, and as insatiable thirst after Fame: both which are to be reputed farre above that dull and earthy pronenesse of the mind of some men, whose thoughts are bent upon little else but the Bed and the Board. But I tell thee, that this desire of thine being kindled so high in thy melancholy complexion, there arise these three inconveniences from this inordinate heat.</p>
                     <p>First, Thy spirits are so agitated, that thou canst not soberly and cautiously consider the Objects of thy mind, to see what is truly consequent, what not; and so thy reason goes much to wrack.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Thy melancholy being so highly heated, it makes thee think confidently thou hast a Phantasme or <hi>Idea</hi> of a thing belonging to this or that word, when thou hast not; which is a kind of inward Phrensie, and answers to the seeing of outward apparitions when there is nothing before the sight. Thus art thou
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:115239:152"/>
defeated in thy designe of knowledge in divine and naturall things by this distemper.</p>
                     <p>But thirdly, The same untamed Heat causeth Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, Confidence and Pride. And hence ariseth thy Imprudence. For I tell thee, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> there is no such imprudent thing in the world as Pride. Wot'st thou not what the humour of all men is; how they think themselves no inconsiderable things in the world? You know the story in <hi>Herodotus,</hi> how when the Greeks had overcome the <hi>Persians</hi> and after it was debated amongst them, to whom the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

Wherefore it is plain that he that will not let any man go before him, provokes all men. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was thy imprudence, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> that thou wouldst take the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> to thy self without so much as any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate or asking leave, when every <hi>Galenist, Aristote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lean, Cartesian,</hi> and <hi>Theosophist,</hi> thinks it belongs to him as much as to thee. Thus hast thou provoked all men against thee, and made ship-wrack of thy fame, as well as fallen short of Learning. But you'le say, why? what would you have me to have done as some others do, who (though they be proud, yet) put on a handsome dresse of Modesty and squeamish Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility? That I tell thee had been indeed something more like Prudence, which thy raised heat could not stoop to, but I must confesse it had been but a kind of <hi>Morall Sneaking.</hi> For as the bending down of the upper parts of the Body, so that the talnesse of the stature thereof is concealed, is the Sneaking of the Body: so to make a mans self more humble then he is, or lesse high-minded, is the Sneaking of the Soul. But the first point of wisdome is to be really humble
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:115239:152"/>
indeed. For an Humble mind is as still as the night, and as clear as the noon-day. So that it is able with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any impatiency or prejudice to discern all things, and rightly to judge of all things. This Christian temper is so sober, and wise, that no Imposture can surprize it, nor ever will it hurt it self by rashnesse and imprudency. This is the heir of God, the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury of all humane, divine, and naturall knowledge, and the delight and praise of men where ever it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears. But the inseparable companions of haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, are Ignorance, Shame, and Enmity. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, <hi>Eugenius,</hi> as this divine Humility is of more worth, so is it of more labour then to find the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers stone,</hi> or the famous <hi>Medicine</hi> you talk of; I am certain of more consequence by ten thousand times. And me thinks now at length through all those waves and rufflings of thy disordered mind, I see something at the bottome in thee, O <hi>Eugenius,</hi> that begins to assent to what I say, that begins to shine and smile, and look upon me as a very pleasant Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, sent (not without providence) to toy and sport thee into a more sober temper, and advertise thee of the highest good that the Soul of man is capable of; and thou wilt I am confident very suddenly say, and that from thy heart, that <hi>better are the wounds of a friend, then the kisses of an enemy.</hi> Or if thou canst not yet fancy him a friend that hath worn the vizard of a foe so long, yet I do not mistrust but that thou wilt be so wise, as, according to <hi>Xenophons</hi> Principle, not onely not to be hurt, but also to be <hi>profited by thine enemy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>An enemy indeed is not a thing to be embosomed and embraced, as the <hi>Satyr</hi> would have done the fire when he first saw it, and therefore was forewarned by <hi>Prometheus</hi> to abstain,

Why then should my <hi>Eugenius</hi> be troubled, that he was once Childish, Ignorant, Proud and Passionate, when he is well cured of those distempers. We are what we are, and what is past is not, and therefore is not to afflict us. But he that is more anxious concerning Fame then Virtue, and seeks onely to seem a gallant and invincible thing to the whole world, when in the mean time his mind is very weak and vulnerable. I know my <hi>Eugenius</hi> is so wise, that such a man as this, will seem as irrationall to him, as if one having by ill chance cut his shinne, he should be lesse solicitous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout healing of his legge then mending of his stocken.</p>

                  <opener>SIR,</opener>
                  <p>I Received yours <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I suppose the tedious length of the way and many digressions, and by-visits of the Bearer, made it to come so late; but it is not the more unwelcome or lesse seasonable. Your good opinion of what I have wrote against <hi>Atheisme</hi> is no small satisfaction to me for my pains therein. For that men of so exquisite judgement as your self al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of a Performance, it is to me a plain argument, that if others do not concurre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that the fault is more to be suspected in him that reades, then in him that writes the <hi>Discourse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. If my <hi>Observations</hi> and <hi>Reply</hi> be shortly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed, as you hear, it is through the importunity of our friend <hi>Parresiastes,</hi> who would not let me be quiet till I had given him leave to do it. The strongest Engine that he had to move me to it, was the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, that if I would not let them be reprinted while I might amend such things as I thought fit, that they might hereafter be republished whether I would or no, with what ever disadvantages hang upon them.</p>
                  <p>That you wish they were as effectuall an <hi>Antidote</hi> against <hi>Enthusiasme,</hi> as That other is against <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isme,</hi> it does imply that you think they are not; and I thank you for your freedome in declaring your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; to which I willingly subscribe. But <hi>Parresia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes</hi> will prefix a Treatise concerning the <hi>Nature, Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Kindes,</hi> and <hi>Cure</hi> of <hi>Enthusiasme,</hi> that in my

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Methinks he is something bold with some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours that considerable men set no small price upon. But let him look to that; You know the man and the manner of his disposition, how free and exert he is, and what a sincere zeal he has to the Truth. What he writes concerning <hi>David George</hi> and that other so near akin to him, I must confesse I dare not blame his boldnesse therein, they seeming to me (so farre as I can possibly fathome them) at the best but <hi>Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astick Sadduces.</hi> But as for <hi>Iacob Behmen</hi> I do not see but that he holds firm the Fundamentalls of the Christian Religion, and that his minde was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly united to the head of the Church, the cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>Iesus,</hi> to whom he breathed out this short ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation with much Fervency of spirit upon his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, <hi>Thou crucified Lord Iesus, have mercy on me, and take me into thy kingdome.</hi> But though I be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well assured of the sanctity of the Man, and look upon him as one that is as much beyond the other two, as his boastings of his own person are lesse then theirs who either equalized themselves with, or set themselves above our Saviour, who is God blessed for ever; yet it is to me no argument at all, that whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he writes is from an infallible spirit; But the case seems to me to stand thus.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There being two main wayes whereby our mind is wonne off to assent to things. viz. The <hi>gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Reason,</hi> or <hi>The Strength and vigour of Fancy</hi>; and according to the complexion or constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body we being led by this Faculty rather then by that, suppose, by the <hi>strength</hi> or <hi>fulnesse</hi> of
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:115239:157"/>
                     <hi>Fancy</hi> rather then the <hi>closenesse</hi> of <hi>reason</hi> (neither of which Faculties are so sure guides that we never mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry under their conduct; in so much that all men, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the very best of them that light upon truth, are to be deemed rather fortunate then wise) <hi>Iacob Beh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> I conceive, is to be reckoned in the number of those whose <hi>Imaginative</hi> facultie has the prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence above the <hi>Rationall</hi>; and though he was an holy and good man, his naturall complexion notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing was not destroyed, but retained its property still; and therefore his imagination being very busie about <hi>divine things,</hi> he could not without a miracle fail of becoming an <hi>Enthusiast,</hi> and of receiving di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truths upon the account of the strength and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of his Phansie: Which being so well quallifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with holinesse and sanctity, proved not unsucces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in sundry apprehensions, but in others it fared with him after the manner of men, the sagacity of his imagination failing him, as well as the anxietie of reason does others of like integrity with himself.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Which things I think very worthy of noting, that no mans writings may be a snare to any ones minde, that none may be puzled in making that true which of it self is certainly false; nor yet contemne the hearty and powerfull exhortations of a zealous soul to the indispensable duties of a Christian by any supposed deviations from the truth in speculations that are not so materiall nor indispensable. Nay though something should fall from him in an Enthusiastick <hi>Hurricano</hi> that seems neither sutable to what he writes elsewhere, nor to some grand Theorie that all men in their wits hitherto have allowed for truth, yet it were to be imputed rather to that pardonable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease that his naturall complexion is obnoxious to, then to any diabolicall designe in the Writer; which rash
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:115239:158"/>
and unchristian reproach is, as farre from the truth, if not further, as I conceive, then the credulitie of those that think him in every thing infallibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. I cannot but interpret it as an argument of the sincerity of your affection and friendship that you discover some measure of sollicitudes, what successe this second edition of the forenamed Pamphlets may have, and must give you many thanks for your so sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable and particular intimations of what you have observed most liable to the hasty censure, as you say, of either the heedlesse or malevolent Reader; but I suspect it is but an handsome Scheme of suggesting to me your own dissatisfaction in severall of those pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages which you propound. And therefore I am the more willing for surenesse to answer to all, to ease you of that anxiety your mind may be any way burdened with on my behalf, when you shall understand that all is right at the bottome, let things appear at first sight as they will.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. First then as for my Observations, let the mirth and humours therein be as wilde and exorbitant as they may, provided they be no other then may well be found in some angry <hi>Aristotelean</hi> that has taken pepper in the nose, upon the sleights and abuses put upon his Master <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the <hi>Dramatist</hi> has offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing in all this, having throughout kept the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum of such a person as he intended to represent. And must confesse that on set purpose that the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter might be the more certainly concealed, I gave my self leave to let slip sometimes such passages as were least likely to fall from my pen. But under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing what an enraged Antagonist I had got, that he might not adde injustice to wrathfulnesse, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge his choler at randome where ever his suspicion
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:115239:158"/>
and jealousie should carry him, I thought it better to be so courteous as to satisfie the inquisitive, and so just as to prevent that injury that might fall upon the fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly suspected, then to shelter my self any longer by concealing the authour of that merry Exploit.</p>
                  <p>But as concerning my Reply, I cannot there give so succinct an account, the impatiency and fury of my Adversary having torn off our masks, and constraind us to act in our known persons, but must descend particularly to those severall Exceptions that you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to have been made against sundry passages of that writing, and I shall take them in that order of Pages as they lie.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. What you intimate concerning the whole <hi>second Section</hi> (according as <hi>Parresiastes</hi> has divided the Book) as if it smelt too much of pride and magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my self, You are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>irst to consider what a showre of dirt my Antagonist had powred upon me in his foul Answer, endeavouring to tread me down into a dunghill if he could; and therefore it is more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable if I rise up with more courage and shake off all suspicion of being so pittifull a creature as he would make me; and truly I had a conceit that shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inward frame of my mind so freely to him, it might have proved as successefull as the flying open of Prince <hi>Arthurs</hi> shield in his combate with the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <hi>Orgoglio</hi>; but it seems he had no eyes to behold that kind of lustre. But in the second place that which is more considerable, I magnifie my self in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but in the common accomplishments of every sincere Christian, and that I set them off in so high and lofty a strain, is but a zealous profession that the ordinary Christian graces are farre to be preferred before all the miracles of Magick that my Antagonist hankers after, all the knowledge of Nature, and what
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:115239:159"/>
ever else the world will afford; but I have apologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to this purpose already in my Preface to my <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote.</hi>

                  <p n="8">8. Pag. 175. line 27. <hi>Sing of Platonick Faith.</hi> What you write as if some men conceited from this passage that I affected a Faith that was not Christian, I wonder much at their mistake. These verses are transcribed out of my Poems of the <hi>Immortality of the Soul,</hi> and contain a very considerable argument thereof, which is the Goodnesse or Benignity of God, on which the <hi>Platonists</hi> or better sort of the Heathen relyed, or reposed themselves upon, in their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of happinesse from him; that is, They had their Recumbency upon that principle in God which moved him in the fulnesse of time to send <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, according as it is written, <hi>God so loved the world, that he gave his onely begotten Sonne, &amp;c.</hi> which is a greater and more particular manifestation of the love of God, then the poore Heathen ever did enjoy. But yet so farre forth as they did rely on the goodnesse of God, they did not differ in their faith from us Christians, who also rely upon the same, though upon more explicite terms, and from a more certain and particular knowledge thereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> that noble pledge of the love of God towards us. Besides, the Resurrection and Ascension of Christ is a more palpable argument of a blessed Immortality then any the Philosophers could ever produce.</p>

Pag. 177. l. 23. <hi>My glory, my joy, my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated God.</hi> That some have been scandalised with this Passage I conceive is, because they have fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied that I understood thereby a more mysterious union with God then is competible to any saving Christ himself. But for my own part I am so farre
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:115239:159"/>
from thinking that the union of a Christian with God is <hi>hypostaticall,</hi> that I hold it utterly inconsistant with Christian Religion to think so. For if our uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God be the same that Christs union is, we are as much God as he, and as lawfull objects of adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: whith in my apprehension destroyes the whole frame of Christianity. But to those that have no mind to cavill, this place have been found void of all offence, it signifying no more then what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely in the Scripture if you compare S. Peters <gap reason="foreign">

John, <hi>God is love, and he that abideth in love, abideth in God and God in him.</hi> But it is a riddle to me that God who is <hi>Love,</hi> should communicate himself so fully as to live and abide in a man, and yet that he should not be for all that communicated to him, which they do plainly imply that cavill at this Passage.</p>

That he came into the world to root out the works of the Devil, and every plant that is not of his Fathers plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that is, all manner of Idolatry and Wickednesse of either Flesh or Spirit.

And whosoever contradicts any of these, I make bold to pronounce (let him talk as sweetly and graciously as he will) that it is nothing but either puzzled Nature, obfuscating Melancholy, or some Diabolicall mysterie working in him, that imboldens him to contradict so holy a truth.</p>

But if in stead of Children they prove Bears and Lyons, and devour their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours out of a zeal to their own follies, or it may be out of a worse principle, Pride, Covetousnesse and Revenge; I must confesse I think they are not then Christians at all, but Wolves in sheeps clothing.</p>

For for a man to be hot for some Point that with a great deal of study and care he has hammered out of the Text, and imperiously to obtrude it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others, seems to me as absurd, as if some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited Artisan should force another to buy some ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate toy, that he has spent a great deal of time and pains upon, at his own rate, when the chapman pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses he has no need of any such impertinent curiosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

That if we sinne and unfainedly repent thereof, that we have a Mediatour Jesus Christ the righteous, who is a propitiation for our sins.

For if a man stick to such plain things as these, and others of the same nature that are to be found and easily understood in Scripture, he has built his house on the Rock of ages, and all the <hi>Sectarian Gibberish</hi> in the world cannot distract him, nor dissettle or bring him into any diffidence but that he is safe and well.</p>

And I conceive that he doth work
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:115239:163"/>
more cunningly and despightfully against the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Christ in that Sect then in any open Sect that has appeared in these latter times.

                  <p>Now in as many as this Stratagem takes effect, the end of Christianity is supplanted as Christianity it self was endeavoured to be supplanted before.

                  <p n="19">19. At the beginning of the late commotions here in England I dream'd thus. Me thought I was at a
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:115239:165"/>
friends house in the rode betwixt <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> where having gone out into the outward court in a bright Moon-shine night; a little before I return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in again, I looked first towards the North, where I saw in the heavens a Woman with a child on her lap, holding her arm over it, with that care and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse that Mothers and Nurses usually do over young Children. I afterward turned me toward the South, and looking up I beheld the Effigies of a very old Man with a long beard, lying on his side all along stretcht parallel to the Horizon. This represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was, as I easily discerned, made of a very bright cloud, that had imbibed plentifully the light of the Moon. I looking steddily upon him, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to move his right arm, but from the elbow onely, and that very leasurely, raising it but a little height, and then let it fall to the same posture it was before. He moved it thus, so farre as I can remember, some six or seven times, lifting this part of his arm every bout higher then other, and keeping the same distance of time in all; but the last stroke was struck by his whole arm from the very shoulder. When he had thus done, I turned my face, returning into the house; but before I had reached the door, he sent these words after me, with an hollow voice much like thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der afarre off, <hi>There is indeed love amongst you, but onely according to the flesh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="20">20. Not at all dismaid neither with the sight nor the voice I passed into the hall and told them what had hapned, expounding the generall meaning of my dream in my dream, advertising them that the Old man his manner of striking so gradually, was an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme of the proceedings of God when he chastises a nation, adding certain reasons out of <hi>Aristotles</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks, which I had very lately read, why those
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:115239:165"/>
strokes must needs be one heavier then another and the last (which represented the hand of God striking to a more signall overthrow if not finall destruction) by farre the most heavy of all.</p>
                  <p>That this was the Method of God in plagueing a people, but that which provoked him to wrath or brought mischief upon them was the want of that life and spirit of Christianity which is <hi>the Divine love,</hi> whereby the eagernesse of the love of the world with all the honours and pleasures thereof is abated and all Christian duties, we owe one to another, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the more easily performed. For whereas that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall love will amount to no more then what is found in wilde Beasts and base Vermin, that rake and roven and tear away their prey where ever they can get it, pulling it into their own dens and dark holes to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for themselves and their young ones; that <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Love</hi> which is the Spirit of God communicated to us, makes us more universally benigne and kinde, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siring and endeavouring the good of all, being as ill at ease at the calamity of our Neighbours, as if it had hapned to our selves; and rejoycing as much in their welfair as if it were our own; which assuredly is the indispensable condition of every true Christian; and therefore if we were such, Christendome could not be embroyled in such warres, disturbances and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions as it has been these many ages. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose I spake in my sleep, which being no more then I thought oftentimes before, while I was awake, could seem to me to have nothing in it extraordinary.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. That which may seem most strange to others is the <hi>Vision</hi> (as I may so call it) in this dream, which would have amused my self, had I not remembred that over night I had looked upon the Frontispiece of <hi>Ptolomies</hi> Maps, where my fancy it seems having laid
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:115239:166"/>
hold on his venerable beard, drew in thereby the whole scene of things that presented themselves to me in my sleep; And though some may think this dream to be more particularly applicable to what has hapned of late yeares here in <hi>England,</hi> yet no man can demonstrate but that the congruity may be onely casuall.</p>
                  <p>Now as occasionally from the Picture of <hi>Ptolomie</hi> my Fancy was carried into that dream by night, so was it also in the day time transfigured into this breathing and speaking <hi>Colosse,</hi> by <hi>Eugenius</hi> his men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning of and comparing me with that enormous sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. For that the fancy will work of it self without any leave or direction from our superiour faculties, is very plain, and that as well by day as by night. But the difference is, that a man awake has ordinarily the power, if he think good, to curb such Fantasmes when they appear, and so I could have done this knowing right well it was but an occasionall fancy, but such as would serve my turn to set off that Truth I had to declare unto the World, with more force and vigour; and therefore I let it go on. Nor is there in all this any thing either extraordinary or divine, the naturall causes being so apparent to any mans capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>

But that Truth which this breathing <hi>Colosse</hi> uttered to the world is not onely divine, but one of the most concerning divine Truths that Christiandome can take notice of. For it arises out of the height of that life that is truely and indispensably Christian, and without which those happy times, which the Prophets have prophecyed of and very good and precious men hope for, will never come upon the earth. And if that of the Deity that lies hid in men (<gap reason="foreign">

raised it self up more then ordinarily at this bout, it producing nothing but a more quick and sensible gust of a truth, so sacred and evident to every one in whom the grace of God does abide, it cannot amount to that which men call <hi>Enthusiasme,</hi> but is to go onely for a sober and warrantable, though a very vehement and affectionate fit of Love and Devotion, upon a fuller and clearer impresse or manifestation of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of that Life and Spirit which Christ came to communicate to the world. Of which by how much every one does partake, by so much the more he will slight the curiosities of Opinions, and in this light plainly see that the zeal after a conformity to them does more then any thing hinder the growth of Truth, and the advancement of the kingdome of Christ upon the earth. For while they have that whereby they may make a show of godlinesse before others, they are the more easily retain'd in the estate of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie, they fancying that they serve God well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in the promoting of their own conceits and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions which they shamefully call the Truth of God. And besides, they hinder that good which sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Christians may do in the world, who have so much the fear of God before their eyes, that they will not lie and dissemble for their own advantage, and therefore men of least conscience, carelesse what is true or false in Religion, but very crafty for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and that will conform to any thing to mend their livelihood (and those that are the most Atheisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, will be able to do this the most exquisitely) get into power and place in the Church, and so the Wolf having put on the Shepherds coat and taken his crook into his hand, very formally tends the flocks of Christ, and undoubtedly will give a wonderfull fair account of his office at the last to that great Pastour and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of our souls.</p>

                     <pb n="314" facs="tcp:115239:167"/>This therefore that is so intelligible and rationall so manifest and commonly known to all that have made that due progresse in Christianity which they may, is not to be held as an extraordinary piece of Enthusiasme but a plain, though very zealous, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of an indispensable Truth.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. That which came the nearest to <hi>Vision</hi> or <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasme</hi> that ever hapned to me, was about seven or eight and twenty yeares ago, when on a morning in my bed after break of day I heard, as I thought, a sound of a Trumpet very shrill and piercing, the longer it sounded, the more shrill and piercing it was, so that it pain'd my eare more and more. Methought I was then in an open place and in a free Horizon, saving that something a thick Mist hundred my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, but it grew thinner and thinner, and an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company of Angels, blew and purple co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd about the shoulders, filled the heavens round about, but the sight was obscure by reason of the mist. But according as the Trumpet sounded louder and louder, the Mist grew thinner and the Vision clearer: But the shrilnesse of the Trumpet did pierce my eare with such a great pain, that I could not go on till the sight was perfectly cleared up.</p>
                  <p>That which might perswade a man that there was something more then ordinary in it, is this, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I was really asleep; yet I did plainly find in my self a power of waking my self, if I would; which seems almost impossible for one that is asleep. But out of the great desire that I had to see the vision cleared up. I forbore the waking of my self so long as I could, and endured the great torture the shrill sound of the Trumpet put me to; but at last it growing intolerable, I was fain to awake my self out of this dream.</p>
                  <p>That a man should be in such intolerable torture
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:115239:167"/>
may also seem to some to be beyond the causality of a dream: But to me it does not at all, who, upon the reading of <hi>Aristotle's</hi> Mechanicks, where he speaks of the <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and the power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving timber thereby, fell into a dream of moving a great piece of timber by this ordinary engine, that caused a pain unspeakable. For every time I pressed down the Lever with my body, I was in as great a torment, as if my bowells had been torn out, so that groaning very pitteously, my Chamberfellow called to me, thereby ridding me of my dream and pain at once. And in my apprehension that other circumstance of finding it in my own power to awake my self if I would, is not much unlike their case that are troubled with the <hi>Ephialtes,</hi> that perceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in some sort asleep, and endeavour to waken themselves as well as they can.</p>
                  <p>That which seems most unanswerable to my self is what it is impossible to propound to another, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unexpressable, and that is that admirable Temper and frame of spirit I found my self in upon my wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, which, if it were in my power to relate, would seem to most men incredible; so that, for this passage sake, I should be prone to suspect something more then naturall in what preceded it, did I not consider that sometimes there may be of it self such a Tenour and Disposition of body, that may either suggest or imitate what is most holy and divine: So uncertain a guide shall we have of whatsoever offers it self to us, and would inform us of any thing that cannot be made good out of Reason or Scripture: And I know nothing worth the taking notice of in all Divinity that is not determinable by these two.</p>

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:115239:168"/>
or Theoreticall Mysterie, but concern the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of our affairs, and particular negotiations, humane prudence being so lubricous a principle, when we are once really at a plunge; I think it not at all unwarrantable in a matter not unjust to follow such intimations as these, if they be offered, there being therein more of self-resignation and a fuller relyance upon that Providence which by such <hi>uncertain</hi> becks and nods (as they must needs seem to strangers) doth notwithstanding hereby sometimes most <hi>clearly</hi> and <hi>certainly</hi> communicate her mind and purpose to her own favourites, to their singular advantage and stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious successe.</p>

Sir you will pardon my garrulitie, as you may be enduced to term it from <hi>Theophrastus</hi> his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who makes the telling of a mans dreams a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of that vice: But the best is it must be then to a stranger, which will I hope excuse me that have told mine to an intimate friend; and I might further justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my self from the practice of <hi>Cardan,</hi> that publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed severall of his to all the world, which I think are of as little consequence as these of mine.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. I have now answered to the chief <hi>Exceptions</hi> made against any particular passage of my <hi>Reply.</hi> What you say of some that they much marvell at the whole designe in generall, that I do so zealously and industriously oppose <hi>Enthusiasme,</hi> they not seeing that it is worth the while so to do; Certainly this censure must come from such men as are either tainted with this disease themselves, or else such strangers to it, that they have not so much as observed the mischievous workings thereof. But for my own part I being so throughly perswaded in my judgement of the truth and solidity of Christian religion and that it is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable by Reason against all cavills and sophistries
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:115239:168"/>
whatsoever (let the Adversary oppose as fiercely and cunningly as he can) and obseruing likewise that the whole businesse of <hi>Enthusiasts</hi> is to <hi>decry Reason</hi> as an <hi>impure</hi> and <hi>carnall thing,</hi> I could not but look upon <hi>Enthusiasme</hi> as the onely Sleight and most effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall Engine (seem it to others as despicable as it will) to unhinge Christiandome, dethrone Christ and annull that great and precious Mysterie of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in which the Wisedome and Goodnesse of God does more clearly shine forth, then in any Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Providence that he ever set a foot as yet in the world. And what is to come, must be but the accomplishment of this Period. Wherefore it seemed to me very unjust and ignoble, not to endeavour to the utmost, by any means possible and lawfull, to hinder the progresse of so dangerous an evil, and to provide so well for the honour of that Religion I was born under and do professe; that it should not be basfled or dashed out of countenance by that which is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Religion, solid Reason, nor any thing else lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, but merely a bold and wilde Distemper of a Melancholy spirit.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. To what some particularly except against the <hi>Merriment</hi> of my <hi>Reply</hi> I have said enough else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and therefore will onely adde this, That if that false Gravity, which is nothing else but a sower kinde of pride, take the chair of censure, Mirth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing thence to any indifferent Judge, will need no Pleader; but if she stand in competition with that sedatenesse and benigne sadnesse of spirit wherein dwells true Gravity indeed, she will then deserve none. For assuredly this temper is beyond all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison better then that merry Complexion. For whereas Mirth and Levity do often betray the Soul, so that she is surprised by what is foolish and vain,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:115239:169"/>
this Stayednesse and Gravity does not onely guard her from what is evil, but restrains her from what is tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall, and makes her spend her pains upon no enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise but what is worthy so noble a nature as her own; which is no Pride, but true Magnanimity and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity of Spirit. Besides, such as are of a light Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius that is alwayes so pleasant and well contented, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a redoundancy of toyishnesse and sport; it is a signe that their desires are shallow, in that they are so easily and continuedly satisfied, and therefore in a present incapacity of valuing the representations of more weighty objects. Whence it is that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundest &amp; most concerning Mysteries of Philosophy and Religion are never infused into such slight &amp; flue vessels. But the grave and sad minde that seldome ruminates on small matters, whose carriage being calme and quiet to the world, yet is full of workings within and strong breathings after the noblest Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions, does not fail in the conclusion to enjoy her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment secretly and apart from others, being fully compensated for her patience with all that wisdome and holinesse that the Spirit of God bestows on them that have long waited for him.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. And in this I conceive, Melancholy men have their speciall advantage, that Complexion making their desires vast and vehement, and their resentments very deep and vivid, and therefore very fit for the highest communications, their desires, joy and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse bearing a more answerable proportion to the weighty matters they receive. Hence it is they are more frequently blest with a greater share of illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and extraordinary sanctification then others, if there be no Let by reason of some flaw in Nature, or some default in themselves. For then instead of prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better then others, they may prove farre worse, that
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:115239:169"/>
Complexion exposing them to errours and mistakes proportionable to the greatnesse of their spirits and vastnesse of their desires, and so makes them often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate from the state of men that seem'd to the World extraordinarily holy and illuminate, into meer Mock-prophets and ridiculous Enthusiasts; afterwards Ranters, Atheists, and what not.</p>
