            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>CAsting my Eye upon a Pamphlet entitled <hi>Notes and Observations on the Empress of Morocco;</hi> and finding no Authors name to it, I used my best indeavour to get that knowledge by my Examination of the Style, which the unkind Printer had denied me. But that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was quickly obtain'd: For perusing but the First Page of the Preface, and finding such an Appellation as [<hi>Arrogant Upstart and Illiterate Scribler,</hi>] with this Allusion at the Tail on't, [<hi>This Fellow comes amongst the Poets like one of the Earth-born Brethren, and his first business in the World is to Attacque and Murder all his Fellows;</hi>] I presently recollected the same Fancy, spoken on the same subject, in the Epilogue to <hi>Cambyses.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>Like th' Issue of the Dragons Teeth, one Brother</l>
               <l>In a Poetick fury falls on th' other.</l>
            </q>
            <p>In the next Page I find him strutting, and impudently comparing himself to <hi>Ben Johnson.</hi> [<hi>I knew that to write against him was to do him too much ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: But I consider'd</hi> Ben Iohnson <hi>had done it before to Deeker our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Predecessor,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
            <p>And thereupon with very little Conjuration, by those three remarkable Qualities of <hi>Railing, Boasting</hi> and <hi>Thieving</hi> I found a <hi>Dryden</hi> in the Frontispiece. Then going through the Preface, I observ'd the drawing of a Fools Picture to be the design of the whole piece, and reflecting on the Painter I consider'd, that probably his Pamphlet might be like his Plays, not to be written without help. And according to expectation I discovered the Author of <hi>Epsome-Wells,</hi> and the Author of <hi>Pandion</hi> and <hi>Amphigenis</hi> lent their assistance. How! Three to One thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>? and Three Gentlemen of such disagreeing Qualifications in one Club: The first a Man that has had wit, but is past it; the Second that has it, if he can keep it, and the Third that neither has, nor is ever like to have it. Then boldly on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> went, and fortified with patience (as I found it requir'd) for a full perusal, I wonderd the less at the Deformity of the piece, when such different hands went to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure. The first of these is the only person that pretends an injury receiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>d from a Satyrick Line or two in the <hi>Epistle</hi> to <hi>Morocco</hi>: Such as the Author never
<pb facs="tcp:41789:3"/>
design'd for a particular reflection, and such as I am sure <hi>Elkanah</hi> would have thank'd him for, provided like them, as they had been true, they had been harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less too. And consequently I conclude him the promoter of so Ill-natur'd, and so scurrulous a retort. The Second I suppose only putting his Comical hand to the work, to help forward with the mirth of so ridiculous a Libel: and the Third perhaps out of a Vain Glory of being in Print, knowing himself to be so little a Reptile in Poetry, that hee's beholding to a Lampoon for giving the world to know, that there is such a writer in being. Some have advised me in answering these <hi>Notes,</hi> to retort upon all Three: But that would be a tedious work, besides the inconvenience of it. The two last had not the same ends in writing, nor are they so fair marks as the First, One having no Heroicks in Print, and the other such as cannot well be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacqued; his Plays being fortified against Objections. For like the Leper that from Head to Foot was all Deformity, I defie any man to meet with above one fault in a whole Play of his. And therefore in defending <hi>Elkanahs</hi> writings, to examine His, I think not worth the while, a whole Play being too long for a Repartee. But in taking <hi>Elkanahs</hi> part, I answer but half the Pamphlet: For through the piece I find the whole Town censur'd; at lest all that have seen that Play, being by the modest <hi>Commentatour</hi> Dignified by the Title of <hi>Town-Fops and City Fools,</hi> this wholesome advice being given you in the Preface, [<hi>It will be for the benefit of Mankind to observe what People frequent this Play, that men of common sense may know whom to shun.</hi>] Now the calling all Mankind Fools, one would think were the boldest Drydenism that e're came in Print. But to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you that there's worse behind, this Rude, unmannerly, ill-bred, sawcy and over-grown Rayler cannot forbear calling the Ladies Fools too, when he says, [<hi>I am not ignorant that his admirers, who are most commonly Women, will ressent this ill,</hi> &amp;c.] If therefore through the Examination of his <hi>Notes,</hi> I reply in his Dialect, and use that <hi>Billingsgate</hi> Style, which is but Aping of him, and much against my own nature, I declare that 'tis a Language that his Vnimitable Impudence more than his Quarrel with <hi>Morocco,</hi> or his Abuses on the Author have extorted from me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Reader is desired to take notice in the following Discourse, that all Lines with this Mark‚Äî"‚Äî before them are Mr.</hi> Drydens; <hi>taken out of several of his</hi> Poems: <hi>And all Discourse in an Italick Character within these Figures [ ] are His words in his</hi> Notes <hi>upon</hi> Morocco, <hi>or in his</hi> Conquest <hi>of</hi> Granada.</p>

Muly Labas <hi>in Chains, Before he is in Swadling-Cloaths, in Fetters before he is born.</hi>] Now with <hi>Reverence</hi> would I ask Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> (amongst all his <hi>undeniable Laws</hi> of <hi>Action, Time</hi> and <hi>Place,</hi> those <hi>infallible guides</hi> of <hi>Poetry,</hi> in which he has done <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> to himself, and <hi>Honour</hi> to the World, in being that <hi>Kind Great Master</hi> to the <hi>Minor Poets</hi>) by what <hi>Rule</hi> Men are obliged to reflect on their <hi>past State,</hi> before their <hi>present.</hi> And how is it Non-sence to name what <hi>is,</hi> before we mention what <hi>was.</hi> How many Examples of this kind occurr in Common Discourse, as we say <hi>Ered and Born, Men and Angels.</hi> Besides, I think <hi>Muly Labas</hi> may say I <hi>am condemned</hi> to <hi>Fetters</hi> and <hi>am</hi> [<hi>not was</hi>] <hi>born</hi> to <hi>Scepters,</hi> for Men say in the <hi>Present Tense</hi> they are <hi>born</hi> to such or such an <hi>Estate,</hi> till they are in <hi>possession</hi> of it; But I perceive Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> is so little obliged to <hi>Birth-right,</hi> and so weakly intitled to <hi>Patrimonies,</hi> that 'tis very pardonable in him to mistake in an expression of this kind: Nay, he's so far from a Guilt in this, that were he to discribe himself, I doubt not but he'd tell you what he <hi>has been,</hi> before what <hi>he is, viz.</hi> that he once could write an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Emperour,</hi> and a <hi>Tyrannick Love</hi>: But now <hi>by his own confession</hi> in his <hi>Epilogue</hi> to <hi>Granada,</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Where by the way you must know he was <hi>Eight and Thirty Years Old</hi> when he wrote that, and 'tis now <hi>Three Years</hi> since the writing: you must then expect now no more of that Stamp, his last fury being spent in his <hi>Love in a Nunnery.</hi> And to convince you of this truth, he is now grown as <hi>Ill-natur'd</hi> as <hi>Old Women</hi> in their <hi>decay</hi> of <hi>Beauty,</hi> who make it their business to rail aganst all that's young. Thus the best Title he can allow this <hi>Stripling Poet,</hi> is to call him [<hi>Great Boy</hi>] and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that is his Fault, if it be one To be but a few Years past Twenty, and to show how much he thinks him a <hi>Boy,</hi> as one not able to answer for himself; he quibbles upon his <hi>God-Fathers,</hi> and at every pinch to make out a <hi>feeble Iest,</hi> he cryes [<hi>Oh</hi> Elkanah. <hi>well said</hi> Elkanah, <hi>read Philosophy</hi> Elkanah,] As if he supposed the <hi>Reader</hi> would be infinitely taken with the Novelty of such a Name as <hi>Elkanah.</hi> But hold what have I done! Indeed I was too much to blame to tell the World he is <hi>Old!</hi> When Mr. <hi>Dryden,</hi> as he has declared himself, designes to please none but his <hi>fair Admirers,</hi> the <hi>Female</hi> part of his Audience<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and for them to know he is in <hi>Years</hi> is very <hi>severe,</hi> however, in the same <hi>Epilogue</hi> he answers for himself and says:
<q>
                  <l>"But yet ho hopes he's young enough to Love.</l>
                  <l>'Tis in this Garb unhappy Princes mourn</l>
               </q>
To pass by his Impertinent question, [<hi>are Fetters, the Crape or the Purple that Princes mourn in,</hi>] here he says [<hi>Muly Labas confesses himself a man of mean Courage;</hi>]

dear heart, and <hi>eris mihi magnus Apollo,</hi> though <hi>Instinct</hi> in all cases be what <hi>a man has naturally in himself,</hi> yet that <hi>instinct</hi> never produces <hi>actions,</hi> but from some <hi>circumstance</hi> or <hi>cause, extra hominem.</hi> For example, some men have an <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy</hi> against a <hi>Cat,</hi> and by instinct, though they see her not, shall tremble and sweat, or the like when they come near her, and though by <hi>nature</hi> they have this <hi>Antipathy,</hi> yet 'tis from the <hi>presence</hi> of the <hi>Cat,</hi> that <hi>instinct operates,</hi> they would not <hi>tremble</hi> were she not there. If the Poets Ships, (which he by his [As if] in the first Line, only <hi>fancies</hi> of e'm not <hi>affirms</hi> of e'm, for the <hi>affirmative</hi> would be Non-sence, <hi>Instinct</hi> and <hi>Allegiance</hi> being inconsistent with <hi>inanimate</hi> Creatures.)

               <l>This Realm a King, the World a Virtue, grown</l>
               <l>Too fit for Heav'n, but not to go so soon?</l>
            </q>
            <p>[<hi>The Question is an answer to it self, she asks what her fury had done, that made her lose a Husband,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Why it answers to it self, it made one lose a Husband, the other a Son.</hi>] Sure her fury had done something more then all this. If the King had died in his bed, one would have lost a Husband, and the other a Son, And <hi>Morocco</hi> a King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But certainly it might be supposed his <hi>Murder</hi> might be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of more <hi>Calamities</hi> then his natural death would have been. They might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a <hi>Vengeance</hi> that would attend his <hi>Murder,</hi> besides the concern and <hi>sorrow</hi> of a Nation for so fatal a blow, which her fury was Author of. But this <hi>unmerciful</hi> fellow keeps up his old little thoughts of <hi>Kings.</hi> Such a word as [Lead on] <hi>shall rob 'em of all authority, and make Cyphers of them</hi> whilst they live, and when they are dead, dye which way soever, like <hi>Cats and Dogs,</hi> there is an end of them.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Too fit for Heav'n is a bull, nothing can be too fit for the end it is design'd for, much less for Heav'n.</hi>] But <hi>relatively</hi> a thing may be very properly so call'd. Her saying <hi>he was too sit for Heaven but not to go so soon,</hi> Implied as much as if she had said he was so <hi>good</hi> and so <hi>Virtuous that he was too fit for Heaven,</hi> that is, in so much he was so Virtuous <hi>mankind did not deserve him: but not fit to go so soon,</hi> considering what <hi>loss</hi> mankind would have of him, by his going thither <hi>too soon.</hi>

            </q>
            <p>[<hi>I should have spilt before she did it, is nonsense: it must be, I should spill.</hi>] But now she had don, to say she <hi>should have done</hi> otherwise may be sense. Had it been [I should spill] it had scarce been so. His <hi>telling her,</hi> and the <hi>deed</hi> being both <hi>past,</hi> 'tis more properly said of her [I should have spilt.] For 'tis a praeterperfect in relation to [now she speaks it] not [when it was told her first.] For if he be so strict as to examine in what tense her <hi>spilling a Ravishers blood</hi> was first spoke to her, 'twas neither [I should spill] nor [I should have spilt.] For when the <hi>Queen Mother</hi> set her a work 'tis likely she said Madam do as I tell ye and <hi>you shall spill a Ravishers blood.</hi> But such pittiful observations raise more words then they are worth.</p>

            <p>Because the Poet makes his Villain a Fellow that speaks <hi>scornfully</hi> of things, and defyes every thing that opposes him as <hi>little</hi> and <hi>inconsiderable</hi> therefore he writes nonsense: But something more he drives at in the two last Lines, and says, [<hi>the Poet does as good as far I will not only murder him, but lash him and cool him into a Peace, a Climax much like that of showers of Arrows and of Rain.</hi>] Now how the Poet does as good as say so, or how he makes a <hi>Climax</hi> in his speech, all my study cannot search out.</p>
            <p>I think his <hi>Lashing him into a Calm, and cooling his heat of blood,</hi> is of a piece with the rest: And may as well signifie <hi>he will cool his blood by letting it out,</hi> and <hi>calm his Ambition by cutting his Throat,</hi> as well as this Line. <hi>I'le with

               <l>Kings are immortal, and from life remove,</l>

            </q>
            <p>Here the Poet describes the difference of <hi>Kings</hi> from <hi>Usurpers,</hi> by their reward after <hi>death,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Impertinent</hi> tells us [<hi>'tis nonsense; for death makes all men equal</hi>] I may as well say that Mr. <hi>Drydens Notes upon</hi> Morocco, and Mr. <hi>Cowleys Davi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deis</hi> are equal (pardon the <hi>profanation</hi> for neither the <hi>Authors</hi> nor their <hi>writings</hi> are to be named 'i'th the same breath) and prove it thus: they are both but <hi>paper</hi> and <hi>Ink,</hi> and therefore not <hi>different.</hi> If the Poets discourse tended to nothing but the <hi>corruption</hi> of their <hi>bodies,</hi> I am of his opinion that Death makes a King and an Usurper equal: But this worthy Gentleman keeps constant to his <hi>Notions of Kings,</hi> and as he has not only made so great a Fool of a King in his <hi>Boabdelin,</hi> but by his sense of them through his <hi>Notes</hi> made out his opinion of them in general, to be the same or worse then he has character'd there: I wonder not at all at a <hi>Tenent</hi> that has been so long cherisht by him. [<hi>Another sentence, Kings are immortal and yet dye.</hi>] The Poet is so far from such a contradiction that he calls it only <hi>removing from Life</hi>: Yet if he had used Sir <hi>Positives</hi> own words, the sense had been entire; considering how the whole Speech affirms that <hi>Kings leave this Temporal Life for an immortal one.</hi> But for [<hi>a more glorious sentence, when a man dyes he raigns no more.</hi>] Certainly a King's a man, and yet the Authour had said they raignd agen after they dye. But I grow tired, and wonder for what cause he could crowd such a Rabble of <hi>Iingles</hi> and <hi>Blunders</hi> together, unless he courted the favour to be <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous:</hi> which he of all mankind might have had without this trouble, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

How many more reasons might there be for his stealing her; which if the Poet had occasion to have mentiond you should have heard of.

He will present her Father with her head, a good way to pacifie him, and make him withdraw the Siege. Sending the Lady back might have avoided the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of the War.</hi>] A very pretty King he would make of him the whilst, to say. <hi>Here Sir take your daughter agen, I'le rid my hands of the Baggage, she shall come no more within my doores: let us be friends for I do not like bloody noses, and pray depart in peace if you love me, and you will much oblige yours to command King of</hi> Moroc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>Character</hi> Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> likes. But what if <hi>Elkanahs</hi> King is a little more rough and will fight him, and cares neither for his Army nor him neither: But will cut his Daughters head off, and his too if he can come at it? [<hi>But why</hi> Muly Labas <hi>a Traytor, he a Traytor. I wonder his Father knew him no better then to suspect him of so much Wit as goes to the making one,</hi> &amp;c.]</p>
            <p>Muly Labas <hi>is a Fool, a Fool, a Fool,</hi> the Parrat has so over and over agen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated in the Play, that 'tis high time to clear him. <hi>Muly Labas</hi> in the true sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was but twelve years of age when he came to the Crown: and through the whole Play, the Author has made him, though no great part, yet a man that does nothing but what <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>Circumstances</hi> would convince a <hi>Iuditious</hi> man ought to be don: and if he has any fault 'tis his believing his <hi>Mother Honest</hi>; and if at any time he's misled by her, 'tis by a <hi>credulity</hi> that might very probably be imposed by a <hi>Mother</hi> upon a <hi>Son</hi>; she having to his knowledge acted nothing that should make him believe otherwise.</p>
            <p>But I wonder of all objections how this came from him, knowing how guilty he has been in the <hi>Character of a Boabdelin,</hi> a man that is not only a <hi>Coward,</hi> and one that in his Armies head dares not touch an <hi>insolent Fellow</hi> that he fears <hi>Cuckolds</hi> him, nay one whom he is certain his <hi>Wife Loves better then himself,</hi> and for sooth out of a fear of his <hi>subjects displeasure.</hi> But that <hi>fear</hi> might be taken off, (a very pretty King the whilst) by exposing <hi>Almanzors insolence</hi> to his Army, who though they loved his <hi>Conduct,</hi> and <hi>Courage,</hi> would certainly <hi>consent</hi> or at lest <hi>pardon</hi> their dutiful and humble King, for a peice of Justice don on so <hi>arrogant an abuser of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty.</hi>

            <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>TO talke in our Authors Postscript style of such Jimeracks as [Mathematical Philosophical, and Musical headpeices for the compleating an excellent Poet;] or to answer him in Trigonometrical, Metaphysical, and Monochordical Fustian is not to the purpose. Nor is the answering of his Errata on the Epistle worth the while, there being so little appearance of sense in it, except his proveing a trifle, and a Libel to be the same thing, which is the cheife head of the Discourse, most part of his objections against particular lines through the Play, being before examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongst their Neighbours. All the Apology I have to make is to beg some of my Readers pardons for the length of the Book, most part of mankind being before convinced of the invalidity of most of his idle Cavils, who consequently will esteem the examination of the whole superfluous. But all I can say for the rediousness of this Pamphlet is, that (as Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi> says of <hi>Elkanahs</hi> Play, [<hi>several people are delighted with the sound of Robustuous nonsense</hi>]) so some few that read his <hi>Pamphle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> may take the same pleasure in <hi>Feeble nonsense,</hi> and for ought I know be cheated into an esteem of any thing that comes from so received an Author as a <hi>Dryden.</hi> And therefore to disabuse them, has been the occasion of swelling the Book. In all the faults I have mustred against Mr. <hi>Drydens Granada,</hi> or any other of his writings I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare I have not objected any thing but what I think a gross mistake, Bombast, or hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble nonsense. Had I retorted like him, I might have made such an examination of a whole Play as I have done of his Description of Ships in the Indian Emperor, and no doubt it might have met with the same success as his Notes upon <hi>Morocco.</hi>
