            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this propoſall of the point for debate, there are onely two words will need an account to be given of them: 1. What is meant by Reſiſting. 2. Why the word Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is put in. For the firſt, Reſiſting, here ſignifies violent, forcible, offenſive reſiſtance, fighting againſt, as <hi>Heſychius</hi> the beſt Scripture-gloſſary explaines it, (<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) and the Apoſtle in like manner, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. uſing <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> promiſcuouſly for the ſame, and ſo in other places, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is true, it is uſed ſometimes in a wider ſence. But that will not here be materiall, when we here ſet downe before-hand what we meane by it. For the ſecond, the word [colour] is in the Title added, onely for this reaſon, (not to prejudge the Religion, which is fought for, to be onely a colour, but) becauſe it is poſſible for a man to fight for Religion, and yet not upon colour of Religion, to wit, in caſe the Religion for which he fights be eſtabliſht by the Law of the Land, for then his colour for fighting may be the preſervation of Law, which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is bound by oath to maintaine, and though he fight for Religion, yet it is under that other colour: whereas he that fights upon colour of Religion making that his onely pretence of fighting, is <hi>ipſo facto</hi> ſuppoſed to fight for a Religion diſtant or contrary to that which is eſtabliſhed by Law, and ſo all pretence or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Law excluded, yea, and all ſuppoſition of failing in the Magiſtrate, he ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for the Law preſent, not againſt it; which I deſire may be the ſetting of the caſe, to exclude the fallacy, <hi>plurium interrogationum,</hi> and to diſtinguiſh the quarrell of Religion from that other of Law, and ſo to meddle at this time onely with that which is fully within the Divines Spheare, and leave the other to ſome body elſe.</p>
            <p>Thoſe two termes being thus explained, and ſo the ſtate of the queſtion ſet, the lawfull Magiſtrate, and the eſtabliſht Law of the Kingdome on one ſide, and ſome perſon or perſons inferiour to him, upon colour of Religion, <hi>i.</hi> for ſome Religion
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:55237:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not yet eſtabliſhed by Law, on t'other ſide, that it ſhould be lawfull to them to take up armes againſts him would ſeem not very reaſonable, if he were but a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man, abſtracted from Regall power, (which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ure doth not make it more lawfull to reſiſt him then any body elſe) having broken no eſtabliſhed Law (as is ſuppoſed in the caſe) for what legall accuſation can lie againſt him in a point wherein he hath not broken the Law? But then this will be more unreaſonable, if moreover it be conſidered, that colour of Religion is ſo wide and unlimited a thing, that no man, that is never ſo much in the wrong in any opinion, but thinkes himſelfe in the right (for otherwiſe he would not continue in that error) and ſo that colour will be plea equally good to all ſorts of errours as well as truths: and beſides, he that hath not ſo much Religion as to be in an errour, may yet have ſo much wit as to make uſe of that Apology for his ſedition, (to wit, colour of Religion) and plead it as legally as the moſt zealous profeſſor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conſequently, if that will ſerve turne, who ever ſhall but pretend to beleeve con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Religion eſtabliſhed in any Kingdome, ſhall be <hi>ipſo facto</hi> abſolved from all bend of Allegiance in <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> power in the Magiſtrates hand, beſides that in every mans owne breft or conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and yet more particularly, a reſtraint for hypocrites as well as any elſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for pretenders of Religion, who, if this ground would hold, were left unlimited. Where if it be interpoſed that ſuch an one that thus falliciouſly pretends Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though by this diſgu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe he eſcape here, yet ſhall ſurely pay for it hereafter; and that that is ſufficient, becauſe there is no other Court, but of that ſearcher of hearts, to which the hypocrite can be bound over: I anſwer, that although that be true, yet is it not ſufficient, becauſe, although there be a judgement to come for all crimes, yet it is no withſtanding thought neceſſary to have preſent iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures alſo, not to leave all offenders to terrors at ſuch a diſtance, and indeed for the continuance of the peace of communities to provide ſome violent reſtraint at the preſent for thoſe whom thoſe greater but future determents cannot ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worke on. This every man knowes is the originall of humane Lawes, yea, and of Dominion it ſelfe, a <hi>proviſion</hi> that all men will not doe their duties for love or feare of God, (it is apparent, the Jewes would not under their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) and therefore for good mens ſakes, and for peace ſake, and for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Communities, thoſe ſuperadditions have beene thought neceſſary, as ſome thornes in the hedge of Gods Law, that may pierce the hands and ſides of him that ſhall attempt to breake over or thorough it. From whence the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will be evident, that the Rules for the preſerving of government muſt be ſuch as ſhall have force to reſtraine the Atheiſt or the hypocrite as well as the good Chriſtian (which ſure will leſſe need thoſe reſtraints) or elſe they are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly unſufficient to the attaining of their end, <hi>i.</hi> to the preſerving of government, peace, community, or protecting any that lives under it: which being ſuppoſed, it will alſo follow, that nothing muſt be indulged upon any colour of Religion,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:55237:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(be his Religion never ſo true, and himſelfe never ſo ſincere in it;) which will open this gap or outlet to others, that may make the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll uſe of it. For this will be utterly deſtructive of the end of government (which is, that we may lead a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and quiet life, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.2.) yea, and of government it ſelfe.</p>
            <p>This argument being thus proſecuted and cleared, might be ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine this whole buſineſſe, were it not for one rejoynder which is ordinarily made, the force of which is taken from that ſupreame care that every man ought to have of his owne ſoule, and conſequently of the maintaining of his Religion on which (to abſtract from all poſſible diſputes concerning the particular truth of it, he being perhaps not acute or artiſt enough to uphold it againſt all obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters) he is fully convinc't, the health and ſalvation of that wholly depends. For the maintaining of which againſt all the humane power in the World, if he may not take up Armes or doe any thing, he cannot ſee what can be fit for him to fight for, (nothing ſure being more precious then that;) or conſequently, why he may not take up that opinion of the Beyond Sea-Anabaptiſts, That it is not lawfull to fight at all, which if it ſhould be yeelded to, although for the preſent it would produce peace, yet it would be little for the advantage of Magiſtrates in the iſſue. To this I ſhall anſwer, by conceſſion of theſe foure things: 1. That Religion is to be every mans Supreame care, the prime Jewell in his Cabinet. 2. That it cannot, at leaſt in humane conſideration, be expected that any man ſhould be leſſe carefull of his falſe Religion (if he be really perſwaded of the truth of it) then any other is of the true. Nay 3. that if he do not uſe any law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes to defend that falſe (whilſt he is convinc't it is the true) Religion; this is a ſinne of lukewarmneſſe in him, though indeed through prepoſſeſſion not to open his eyes to greater light and revelation of the truth offered to him, and perhaps thorough ſluggliſhneſſe not to ſeeke that light, be yet a farre greater ſinne in him. For though no man ought to defend the contrary to what he takes to be truth, yet ought he to be moſt ready to depoſit his errour, not onely when it doth, but alſo when it may appeare to him to be ſo, and to ſeeke to thoſe helpes that may be inſtrumentall to that end. 4. That in ſome caſes the uſe of Armes is not unlawfull. But then all this being thus granted, and ſo in effect that all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes may be uſed for the maintaining of Religion, we muſt yet ſecondly deny the inference of the Objection; upon this onely ground, becauſe though Armes may lawfully be uſed in ſome caſes, and Religion be maintained by all lawfull meanes, yet Armes are not a lawfull meanes for this end, and ſo may not be uſed in this caſe, that is by Subjects againſt the lawful Magiſtrate in caſe of Religion, at leaſt when ſome other Religion is by Law eſtabliſhed in that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Which aſſertion I ſhall confirme onely by foure Arguments: 1. Taken from the nature of Religion. 2. From examples of Chriſt and Chriſtians. 3. From the very making of Chriſtianity, and particularly of the Proteſtant do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. 4. From the Conſtitution of Kingdomes, which being ſubordinate to the other three may deſerve conſideration, as far as it agrees with them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the nature of Religion, which is an act of the ſoule, which cannot be forced or conſtrained by outward violence, and therefore, 'tis apparant, needs no outward defence for the maintaining of it, much leſſe, invaſion of others. A man may be as truly religious under all the tyranny and ſlavery in the world, as in the moſt triumphant proſperous eſtate. They that have power to kill the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:55237:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are not able to commit the leaſt rape upon the ſoule; they may rob me of my life, they cannot of my Religion; the weakeſt creeple in the Hoſpitall may defie the whole Armie of the Philiſtines in this matter. But you will ask, Is not the outward profeſſion and publike exerciſe of Religion ſome part of it, and that to be thus maintained, where any attempt to hinder it? To which I anſwer, That the firſt of this, the outward Profeſſion, can no more be hindred then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer act of the ſoul, but rather may be moſt illuſtrious in time of depreſſion. I may confeſſe Chriſt in the den of lions, in the furnace, on the rack, on the gridiron, and when my tongue is cut out, by patient, conſtant ſuffering in that cauſe. Religion is not ſo truly profeſſed by endeavouring to kill others, as by being killed pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently our ſelves rather then we will renounce it. When I fight, it may be malice, revenge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome hope of gaine, or impunity at leaſt by the preſent ſervice, any one of a hundred worldly intereſts that may help to whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> my ſword for me, of moſt cleerly a hope I may kill and not be killed: and ſo all this while here is no act of confeſſion of Chriſt in thus venturing my life, although I do affirme I do this for my Religion, becauſe though I ſo affirme, men are not bound to beleeve me, there being ſo much oddes againſt me that I doe it for ſomewhat elſe. But when I lay down my life patiently, the ſacrifice of my God, reſigne up all my poſſible worldly intereſts for the retaining of my one ſpirituall truſt, this is to the eye of man a profeſſion capable of no reaſonable ſuſpicion of inſincerity, and indeed none ſo, but this.</p>
            <p>As for the ſecond, the publike exerciſe of the true Religion, it were by all men heartily to be wiſht that it might be enjoyed at all times, for the advancing of Gods glory, increaſe of charity, converſion of others, &amp;c. But if it may not be had by the uſe of lawfull means, it will not be required of us by God; without whoſe ſpeciall providence it is not, that he permitteth us to be forbidden that exerciſe, till the ſame providence be pleaſed to remove ſuch hinderance, and open to us a lawfull way of obtaining it.

            <p>But are we not to take care of our children and poſterity as well as of our ſelves? If our Religion be now ſuppreſt, our poor children and progenie to the end of the world may in all probability be kept in blindneſſe and ignorance, and ſo left to the place of darkneſſe irrecoverably. This objection ſtands ſomewhat pathetically, and is apt to affect our bowels more then our reaſon; moves out compaſſion firſt, and thorow thoſe ſpectacles is then repreſented with improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to our judgement. But for anſwer to it, though the doctrine of election of particular men, as well and as abſolutely to the meanes as to the end, might be (to him that acknowledges it) a ſufficient amulet againſt this fear, and ſo no need of that their jealous care for their poſterity, any farther then it is in their power to contribute toward them (which ſure is no more then to doe what is lawfull for them to doe) yet the anſwer will be more ſatisfactory to all that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Gods providence, however opinioned concerning decrees, that whoſoever conſiders himſelfe as a man, much more as a father of a poſterity, muſt have many things to truſt God with, and onely God, and among thoſe nothing more

then the future eſtate of thoſe which are to come from him. Yet if he be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate and ſtill unſatisfied, unleſſe he himſelfe contribute ſomewhat to the ſecuring of his poſterity in this matter, let me tell him there is nothing (after his prayers to God and paternall bleſſing on them) ſo likely to entaile his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion upon them at his ſealing it by his ſufferings. This ſure will be a more probable way to recommend his Religion to them (when they ſhall hear and be aſſured by that teſtimony, that their fathers thus hoped in God) then by that other ſo diſtant that they died in a rebellion againſt the King, or that this Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion had been in their time turned out of the land, had not they done ſomething ſo unlawfull to protect it. Beſides, the greateſt prejudice which that poſteritie (of which we pretend ſuch care) can ſuffer by my non-reſiſtance, is onely to be brought up in a contrary Religion, to hear that way firſt, but ſure not to have their ears deafed againſt all others when they ſhall be repreſented, nor to bring the guilt of non-repreſentation upon them if they be not. And if I bring forth reaſonable creatures, I hope they will, by the grace of God, make uſe of their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and his grace, to finde out that truth that their ſouls are ſo much concerned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>in; and if (through no default perſonall of theirs) they ſhould miſſe of it, I hope the invincibleneſſe of their ignorance, and their ſincere repentance for all their ſinnes and errours knowne and unknown, and their readineſſe to receive the truth, if it were or might be repreſented to them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would be antidote ſufficient by Gods mercy in Chriſt to preſerve them from that poiſon, ſo they were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full according to their meanes of knowledge to eſcape all other dangers. And all this upon ſuppoſition, but not conceſſion, that the Religion of him that would fight for it were the truth and onely truth; whereas indeed there is not a more ſuſpicious mark of a falſe Religion, then that it is faine to propagate it ſelfe by violence. The Turkes and the Papiſts being the onely notable examples hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to of that practice, till ſome others, directly upon Popiſh principles a little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the application, have faln upon the ſame concluſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>The third exemplary paſſage of Chriſt was in his ſuffering, wherein many particular circumſtances might be obſerved, eſpecially his anſwer to <hi>Pilate, Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And if it ſhould be objected, that this was to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh what God had decreed (ought not Chriſt to ſuffer theſe things, and thus it
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55237:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is written, and thus it behoved Chriſt to ſuffer) and in obedience to that decree, not as matter of example to us, or of intimation, that it had not been lawfull for him to have done otherwiſe. To this I anſwer, That as Chriſt was decreed to that death, and non-reſiſtance, ſo are Chriſtians (if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> may be beleeved) predeſtinated to be conformable to the Image of his Sonne, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. that is, to that patern of his in ſuffering, not fighting for Religion; and that revelation of Gods will in that decree being ſuppoſed, it will follow, That though Chriſt might have lawfully done otherwiſe, yet we Chriſtians now may not, eſpecially being commanded to learn of him particularly his meekneſſe; <hi>i.</hi> eſpecially that Lamb-like qualitie of the Lambe of God in his ſufferings, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.7.

I doubt not but <hi>Tertullian,</hi> a Presbyter, that now laboured in converting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Chriſtians, and was not alwayes in his ſtudy, nay, who had lately been a Lawyer, and ſo not unacquainted with the publike, might know and relate with far better authority then any who hath dared now to contradict him.

            <p>The ſecond proofe to blaſt <hi>Tertullians</hi> relation, is the ordinary one in faſhion now adayes, if any man differs in opinion from us, preſently to examine his whole life, and if eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or as if I ſhould reſolve this man knew no Logick, becauſe in this period he offends ſo much againſt Grammar in theſe words [to turne Montaniſt, who called him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the holy Ghoſt] where the relative [who] hath certainly no antecedent. <hi>Tertullian</hi> cannot, for he called not himſelfe the holy Ghoſt (but onely cited that ſtile ſo ordinary now adayes [<hi>nos ſpirituales</hi>] and all others [<hi>animales pſychici</hi>] and Montaniſt cannot, unleſſe as once <hi>Areopagi</hi> ſignified the Areopagites,<note place="margin">Surect.</note> ſo now by way of compenſation, Montaniſt muſt paſſe for <hi>Montanus,</hi> for he it was that called himſelfe the holy Ghoſt, not all or any of his followers.

But I hope the narration we have now in hand was neither <hi>Maximilla's</hi> nor <hi>Priſca's dreams.</hi> If it was a <hi>fancie,</hi> it was quite contrary to a <hi>furious</hi> one. And for the cloſe of this Argument, wherein <hi>the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The third Argument againſt <hi>Tertullians</hi> teſtimony, is an obſervation of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that <hi>there is a proneneſſe of inclination in much devotion in perſons devoutly given to over-value the workes and piety of other men.</hi> To which my onely anſwer ſhall be, that yet I hope it is not obſerved that devout men are ſo ſtrongly inclined to tell plaine lies, to this end that they may make themſelves over-valued by others. This muſt be <hi>Tertullians</hi> infirmity (if the objecter gueſſe aright) being a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an himſelfe, and in his apology labouring to raiſe an high opinion of Chriſtians in the Gentiles to whom he writes, to which purpoſe if he ſhould forge falſities, I muſt confeſſe it were a ſhrewd weakeneſſe, very ill becomming devotion, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the practice of later times may ſay in excuſe of it.</p>
            <p>The fourth proofe is from a ſecond obſervation, that in <hi>the pious and orthodox Fathers themſelves there are ſome touches, and ſtreines, ſome fibrae of the root of bitternes which afterwards grow ranke in the times of popery, &amp;c.</hi> The Anſw. All that I can collect from hence toward the concluſion deſigned, is that this objecters ſence is, that, for <hi>Tertullian</hi> to ſay there were Chriſtians enough in the Roman Empire to worke revenge on their oppreſſors, was a ſpice of popery; and ſo there is one new
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55237:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
piece of popery more added, to the many which this age hath concluded under that title above the inventory of the <hi>Trent</hi> catechiſme. And ſo now to debate this any further, or profeſſe my ſelfe to opine as <hi>Tertullian</hi> did, is to acknowledge my ſelfe popiſh, and that is as bad as praelaticall: and ſo from henceforth all my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments will but paſſe for temptations, which none but carnall men muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to, be they never ſo demonſtrative. Yet muſt I have leave to wonder how in the cloſe of this Section theſe words [<hi>the ſounder and more conſiderate knowledge of theſe latter times</hi>] can have any reference to the point in hand. For certainly, for the ſtrength of the then Chriſtian party, our knowledge in theſe latter times cannot be ſounder or more conſiderate then theirs that then lived amongſt them; or if it be, the words [<hi>latter times</hi>] will be improper, for ſure it will be affirmed onely of that time wherein Mr. <hi>J.G.</hi> wrote this part of this book<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he was the firſt that ever revealed this act of more conſiderate knowledge to the world.</p>
            <p>The fifth and laſt proofe is, That <hi>whatever their number was, yet it is no wayes likely they ſhould be ſuffered to have any armes, &amp;c.</hi> To which, and to all the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiall ſtate motives whereon it is grounded, (and ſo to all that Section) I ſhall return no anſwer, but the very words of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> which if all put together they do not defend their author from all their aſſaults, neither will I beleeve the Chriſtians ſtrength was ſufficient to buckle with their adverſaries.

Fourthly, he ſaith, They had a way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge without Armes, to wit, by departing from them, by that ſeceſſion to have brought envie upon them (as for example upon diſlike of the preſent ſtate, to have gone to New England, &amp;c. to raiſe an odium upon the Old) but this they would not be ſo malicious is to do neither: nay, beſides <hi>amiſſio tot civium ip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ent,</hi> there would have been a greater number of enemies, then there would have been Citizens remaining. Fifthly, to put all beyond exception, he puts them in minde how one night with a few firebrands they might have wrought their revenge, if it were lawfull for them to repay evill with evill. This one laſt particular being conſidered, is ſo full a demonſtration of the truth now in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, that ſuppoſing there were but one Chriſtian at liberty to uſe that one firebrand, there can be longer doubt but that there was ſufficient ſtrength to worke their revenge, if their Religion would have permitted them to do ſo. And if their Religion (as was ſaid out of him) were the onely reſtraint, then certainly,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55237:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their weaknes was not. Nay, though they ſhould after all this (by a morally impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſuppoſition) be ſuppoſed weak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet if their Religion did truly reſtrain them, as he profeſſes it did, this were abundantly ſufficient to decide the controverſie betwixt us and the Objecter.</p>
            <p>Having proceeded thus far in anſwer to the ſeverall exceptions againſt the truth of <hi>Tertullians</hi> aſſertion concerning the ſtrength of thoſe Chriſtians, I am invited farther by a ſecond proffer of the Objecter to make appeare, that although <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> aſſertion ſhould be ſuppoſed true, yet it were unſufficient, it would not reach the queſtion or caſe in hand. This certainly is ſtrange at firſt ſight, the caſe in hand being, Whether the reaſon of their non-reſiſtance were their want of ſtrength. Which in all reaſon muſt be determined negatively, when once theſe two things are ſuppoſed; firſt, that they had ſtrength; ſecondly, that the command of Chriſt, or making of Chriſtianity was the cauſe of their non-reſiſtance, and not want of ſtrength. But there is no truth ſo evident, but the cunning of ſuch a craftſ-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter will be able to transforme, both from evidence and truth, and therefore (though in all juſtice a man might vow never to have commerce with ſuch a man more, that ſhould undertake thus to maſter his underſtanding, that he ſhould beleeve and not beleeve the ſame thing, yeeld the want of ſtrength to bee the cauſe, at the very time when hee acknowledges or ſuppoſes, firſt, no want of ſtrength, ſecondly, ſomewhat elſe, to wit, the command of Chriſt to bee the cauſe) yet I ſhall (to exerciſe that Chriſtian meekneſſe which I deſire to aſſert by my actions as well as words) wait on this great artificer to the ſecond part of his anſwer. The ſumme of which, as he firſt ſets it is this, that <hi>ſuppoſing the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpake truth</hi> concerning their ſtrength<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet on ſome conſiderations he mentions, <hi>It had been in thoſe that were called to ſuffer both want of wiſdom in reſpect of themſelves, and of charity in reſpect of others, if they ſhould have made the leaſt reſiſtance.</hi> To which my onely anſwer ſhall be to beſeech him to conſider, that this is part of <hi>Tertullians</hi> teſtimony, that the thing that reſtrained them was (not this wiſdome but) the doctrine of their Chriſt; concluding it more lawfull to be kild then to kill, and utterly unlawfull to repay evill for evill. And as for <hi>charity</hi> to <hi>others,</hi> I humbly wiſh that were, or may yet bee conſidered, <hi>how much burden, &amp;c.</hi> this reſiſtance (of which he is the profeſt abetter) hath brought on others who are not parties on either ſide, nor, I hope, ill Chriſtians, if their onely puniſhable crime be, making conſcience of non-reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>To the next Section, in anſwer to a ſuppoſed reply, where he ſaith, <hi>That it is not probable they had any ſufficiency of ſtrength.</hi> I anſwer, that I cannot be ſo tame as thus to be caught, or ſo wild as to imagine that improbable, at a time when <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullians</hi> teſtimony is ſuppoſed to be true (as now it is ſuppoſed) the ſpeciall part of which teſtimony is yeelded to be that they had ſufficient ſtrength. And where he addes 2. that twas <hi>not neceſſary they ſhould be of one mind and judgement touching this ſufficiency, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer, that we doe not aſſert any ſuch neceſſity, nor doth our cauſe any way incline us to it, or want that refuge. For ſure we affirme not that they did actually reſiſt (to which onely<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that concurrence would have been neceſſary) but onely that they would not though they were able, and to the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing of that, the concurrence of judgement you ſpeake of, is not materiall, for if they that did ſo thinke of their ſtrength, were upon grounds of Chriſtian patience and obedience, as farre from doing or attempting it, as any other; theſe
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55237:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
men would certainely have continued in the ſame obedience, though all the world had concurred with them in the opinion of their ſufficiency. For, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe Chriſtian meekneſſe firſt, and then upon any ſupervenient occurrence to be ready for reſiſtance, though it might be a character of the temporary (that I ſay not hypocriticall) ſubjection of our daies, yet muſt not we be ſo groundleſly uncharitable as to affix it on thoſe Chriſtians; and though the objecter ſhould renounce his preſent ſuppoſition, and againe contend that <hi>Tertullian</hi> lied, and ſo diveſt him of all authority as a father, of common honeſty as a relater, yet ſure he will not be ſo ſevere to deny him ſo much of an ordinary <hi>rhetor,</hi> as to make that an ingredient in his Apology for Chriſtians, which were the higheſt piece of an accuſation. Grant but <hi>Tertullian</hi> to have any skill in any of his profeſſions, ſuppoſe him but Orator, if not a Divine, a tolerable pleader, if not a tolerable man, allow him but skill at the Deske, (his firſt Trade, before he was a Chriſtian) the reputation of a little el<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55237:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the King, for that the inferiority implies. An inferior Magiſtrate, in that that it lawfull, and within his Commiſſion, and not thwarted by a ſuperiour, is to be obeyed as well as if he were ſuperiour in that, or as well as the ſuperiour in any thing elſe, but ſure not to the deſpiſing of the ſuperiours lawfull commands, when they doe interpoſe, for that were more then <hi>as well.</hi> When the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that which God and the Law doth not forbid, it may be ſaid, that his commands are to be obeyd as well as Gods, which the Apoſtle intimates, when he ſaith, you muſt be ſubject for conſcience ſake; and the ground of this truth is, becauſe indeed God the ſupreame, commands that ſubjection to the King in ſuch matters. But ſure for all this the King is not to be obeyd againſt God, or where any countermand of his hath intervened, for this were in S. <hi>Peters</hi> phraſe <hi>to obey men</hi> (not aſwell, but rather than God.

The ſhort is, if that which is here ſpoken of, be in it ſelfe neceſſary, we muſt do it, as in ſpight of all countermands of the ſuperiour, ſo without all commands or invitations of the inferiour Magiſtrate; but if it be not neceſſary in it ſelfe, neither will the commands of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I anſwer, That if the phraſe [entire body] ſignifie the head and members too, then the period is true; if not, then the whole Section is fallacious: for it follows not, that though the repreſentative body without the head is more, then a party in the Empire, without the repreſentation of the reſt, therefore the firſt may reſiſt forcibly, though the ſecond ſhould not: for he that from Saint PAVL denies reſiſtance of ſubjects indefinitely to Kings, will not be moved from that hold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by diſcerning ſome other ſlight differences between ſubjects, unleſſe they may appear ſuch that on one ſide they may authorize reſiſtance.

            <p>Well, having gone thus far, in attendance on this Objecter, and to exerciſe that patience, which we ſo much deſire to perſwade: there is yet the greateſt fort behinde unvanquiſhed, erected in the ſixth Section, and reſcued from all ſuppoſed aſſailants in ſix particulars following, ſet up like ſo many fortreſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. The ſumme of it is (for I would not be bound to recite what every one may read in the printed Book) that if <hi>thoſe Primitive Chriſtians had ſtrength, and might lawfully have reſiſted,</hi> (by the way <hi>Tertullian</hi> onely affirms the firſt, and is ſo far from ſuppoſing, that he abſolutely denies the ſecond) yet might <hi>God hide this liberty from them</hi>; and ſo his <hi>after diſpenſations did require that be ſhould hide it from them, and yet manifeſt it to us: and theſe diſpenſations he ſpecifies to be Gods counſell of Antichriſts comming into the world then, and of his being deſtroyed and caſt out now. The hiding of this truth</hi> of ſubjects power and right to reſiſt their Superiours, <hi>being neceſſary to help Antichriſt up to his throne.</hi> And the <hi>commonalty of Chriſtians doing contrary to the will of their Superiours, being the men that muſt have the principall hand in executing Gods judgements upon the Whore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Revel.</hi> 18.4.5.6.9. that is, in the pulling him down.</p>

Now apply this to the point in hand. Certainly the liberty of forcible reſiſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Superiours (though it ſhould be granted) would never be found of this kinde, a liberty brought into the world by Chriſt, which before had not beene there. If he ſhall affirm it was, (as he muſt if that inſtance of eating be perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent) though by the conceſſion of the latter part, he muſt diſclaim all his former old Teſtam. pleas for reſiſtance, from the people about <hi>Ionathan,</hi> from <hi>David,</hi> and from <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The onely thing I can imagine poſſible to be replyed, is that, though the compariſon hold not exactly, yet it may hold in this, that as that liberty of eating was hid to ſome (it matters not by whom, or how) ſo this of reſiſting to others. To which I return, that then it is confeſt that this inſtance doth onely illuſtrate the Objecters meaning, but not ſo much as probably confirm his aſſertion: and then I am ſorry I have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it ſo long, and therefore to bring the point to an iſſue, I muſt thirdly ask, Where this liberty, or the authority for this liberty was, when it was thus hid. Was it in the old Teſtament? Though it ſhould be there, as it is not, yet it might be taken away in the New, (as thoſe things which in the old Teſtament, or the law of nature, are neereſt to giving of that liberty, are abſolutely refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Chriſts Doctrine and practice) and then that were good for nothing. Was it in the new? Then deale plainly, ſhew the place in the new Teſtament which gives that liberty, and is now found out by poſterity, though hidden to them. Sure we have found out no new Scripture, to them unknown (the Nazarites Goſpel though it rehearſe ſome ſpeeches of Chriſt no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Beyond theſe ſeverall wayes of revelation, if poſterity have had any other (or indeed any but that of underſtanding of Scripture, by Scripture light, or aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, which was not before underſtood) from whence to fetch a liberty which is not in the old Bible, or is denied in the New, this is it which we deſire ſo to warne men of under the name of Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſme, which is hardly ever diſtinguiſhable from a demure frenſie, and I muſt call it now the dreame of the dreamers, <hi>Jude</hi> 8. that deſpiſe dominion, ſpeak evill of

dignities, but far from divine revelation. And yet that this is the thing that this Objecter hath an eye to, (and not the underſtanding of Scripture more clearly then before) may appeare, in that he affirms this truth <hi>hid from their teachers,</hi> (though <hi>not from all without exception</hi>) who yet if it were hid in the Scripture, were of all others moſt unlikely not to finde it. As for that offer of proofe, that this truth might lie hid, becauſe there was <hi>no occaſion of ſtudying it</hi>: I anſwer, that in <hi>Tertul.</hi> daies when there was occaſion to ſtudy it, (as great as ever can ariſe any, becauſe the perſecutions then, were as heavie perſecutions) we may by that argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment think they would have ſearcht into it, at leſt the light then would not in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary account have proved more dim, as he ſaith it did, if the Scripture were the candleſtick where this light was held out.

For this is certainly the bottome of the buſineſſe, the want of Chriſtian courage, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, &amp;c. (for that kinde of courage is not in fighting, but ſuffering) hath helpt us of this laſt age to that [dream, not] revelation of liberty, which was never heard of among the ancients. But by the way, it ſeems by the Objecter that now martyrdome is no deſirable thing, nor taking up Chriſts Croſſe, nor fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of him. We are reſolved to have no more to do with martyrdome, think that the thouſand yeeres for the Saints to reigne on earth are now at hand, and ſo ſuffering, or conformity to the image of Chriſt, no longer the thing we are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtin'd to, we muſt ſet up a new trade of fighting, deſtroying, reſiſting, rebelling, leave enduring to thoſe <hi>Chriſtians which were furniſhed with extraordinary ſtrength from heaven.</hi> Which are the Objecters words of the Primitive Chriſtians, which, ſaith he, kept them from ſtudying caſes and queſtions about lawfulneſſe of eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, (which word meere ſhame had put in, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Fourthly, For that whole diſcourſe about Antichriſt there muſt many things be returned. 1.

him to make many truths his footſtoole,</hi> but indeed that reaches not home to the buſineſſe undertaken to be proved, for it follows not thence, that this of reſiſting ſuperiors was one of thoſe tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hs, if it were, then God ſuffered him to make uſe of it, which he could not but by its being made known, whereas he ſuppoſes it was then hid, if he mean Antichriſt hid it, and ſo made the holding it, his footſtool. Then 1. it was not God that hid it, as before he ſaid, but Antichriſt 2. It had then been manifeſt before, uſe then began to be hid, when there was moſt occaſion to uſe it, which before he made improbable. If I were put upon the rack I could not give a rationall account of thoſe words of the objector laſt recited, or ſuch as may but be conſonant to his preſent undertakings: that which followes is more clear that <hi>God cauſed a dead ſleep to fall upon thoſe truths</hi>: If he did, I wonder who firſt raiſed them out of that dead ſleep <hi>Jun. Brutus</hi> or <hi>Buchan.</hi> or M <hi>Goodwin?</hi> but ſtill it ſeems God did on purpoſe hide truths in favour &amp; aſiſtance to Antichriſt to help him into the world, and this, not like the Spirit of ſlumber ſent on men for their puniſhment, but on divine truths which ſure had not deſerved it, yet more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that the doctrine of liberty to reſiſt ſuperiors ſhould be <hi>ſo oppoſite in a ſpeciall maner to Antichriſt,</hi> that it was fain to be laid aſleep to give him paſſage into his throne, ſeemeth very ſtrange to me. 1. Becauſe one piece of Antichriſts pride is to exalt himſelf above all that is called God which is moſtly interpreted Kings, and if rightly, then they that do ſo enhaunce the power of the people; as to make the King <hi>Singulis minorem,</hi> &amp; looſe the rains of obedience ſo far as to permit reſiſtance: wil I fear diſcern ſome part of the mark of the Beaſt upon their own breſts. 2.

            <p>As for the evidence of that Revelation rule that the communality in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their Kings, muſt have the great ſtroke in executing Gods judgement on Antichriſt proved <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.4.6.9. I muſt anſwer, 5. That I ſhall never wonder enough at the power of Prejudice evidenced in this Objecter, by what he hath put together to this purpoſe page 32. To prove that the people contrary to their Kings ſhall deſtroy Antichriſt, this is thought by him ſufficient evidence, that <hi>the people are commanded to go out of her,</hi> verſ. 4. when verſ. 9. it followes that the <hi>Kings of the earth ſhall bewail her, and lament for her</hi>: The concludingneſſe of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:55237:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
argument I ſhall not inſiſt on, but onely look forward to another place which he cites immediately <hi>Revel.</hi> 17.17. <hi>Where the ten Kings are ſaid to hate the whore and make her deſolate.</hi> Now the word Kings in this laſt place ſignifies, ſaith the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecter, not the perſons of Kings but their ſtates and Kingdomes, and to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe proofes are produced, but 1. I beſeech him to deal ingenuouſly: doth the word King ever ſignifie the kingdome oppoſed to the King, 1. Any part of the Kingdom excluding the King; but then 2. See the myſtery of prejudice which I mentioned where it is for the Objecters turne <hi>Revel.</hi> 18. The Kings of the earth muſt ſignifie their perſons in oppoſition to their people, but where it is not for his turne <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. There the word Kings muſt ſignifie the people or any but the King: Would not the ſpirit of meekneſſe have eaſily compounded this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, and have given the word (Kings) leave in both places to ſignifie both their perſons and their Realmes, and ſo have reconciled the places that ſome Kings with their Kingdomes ſhould bewail her, and ſome again hate her, they bewail her, that continued with her till her deſtruction, when they ſee the ſmoak of her burning 18.9. and others hate her who had once taſted of her filthineſſe, and repented and left her before, this were very agreeable to thoſe texts, if we had not peremptorily reſolved to fetch ſome other ſence out of them. 3. That firſt place alone by it ſelf concludes onely thus much that good men come (or are exhorted to come) out from Antichriſt, and avenge the whore, and earthly men that have love to her, bewail her, but not that either the firſt are all common people (for ſure Kings may be called Gods people, or be in that number) or the ſecond none but Kings, as for the proof that thoſe people, verſ. 4. are the ſubjects of thoſe kings verſe 9. Becauſe they are ſuch as come out of Babylon, ſure that is very weak, for Babylon being the province of the whore, there may be kings as well as ſubjects there, and thoſe Kings come out too, as well as thoſe ſubjects. For ſuppoſe King and people of England all popiſh, why might they not all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form together? It ſeemes Antichriſt muſt never be caſt out of a Kingdom till the people do it in ſpight of the King, and therefore it is concluded that it was not done here in the dayes of King <hi>Edward</hi> nor Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> nor King <hi>Iames,</hi> and now ſince the new Revelation have aſſured men that Antichriſt muſt now be caſt out utterly from among us, it is become neceſſary that our Soveraign ſhould be a papiſt, and as much zeal and as ſolid arguments uſed to perſwade our friends that indeed he is ſo, (though his conſtant word and actions now evidence the contrary) as are produced to maintaine any other article of our new Saints belief: one of the moſt ſuſpected and hated hereſies of theſe dayes, is to doubt of the popiſh affections of our ſuperiors eſpecially the King: Well by this doctrine, if the King ſhould chance not to be a papiſt, he muſt turne to be one, or elſe po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery cannot be caſt out in his time. If ſo he ſhould do, turne papiſt on purpoſe to prepare, or diſpoſe his kingdom to turne Antichriſt out, this might be but anſwerable to Gods hiding of truths to that end to help Antichriſt in. But ſhould his Majeſty be ſo malicious as to proove Proteſtant in earneſt, then what would become of that ſure word of prophecy that ſo many have bin perſwaded to depend on, that Antichriſt muſt now be caſt out of this Kingdome, which faith the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecter cannot be, unleſſe the people do it while the King bewailes.

               </gap> the antichriſt, is this that the Pope exalteth himſelf above all that is called God: 1.

            <p>Now for the laſt Topick, taken from the conſtitution of this kingdome. Though that be the Lawyers task, very proſperouſly undertaken by others, yet one generall notion there is of our Laws, which from my childhood I have imbibed, and therefore conceive common to all others with me; and it is this, That the Laws of this kingdom put no man (no Papiſts I am ſure) to death for religion. When Jeſuites, and Seminary Prieſts have ſuffered, every man is ſo perfect in the Law, as to know that it is for treaſon, by a Statute that makes it ſuch for them to come into this kingdome. The truth of this, and the conſtant pleading of it againſt all Objecters, hath made me ſwallow it as a principle of our Law, that even Popery ſtrictly taken (and not onely as now this laſt yeere it hath learnt to enlarge its importance) is no capitall crime. From whence, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, I know no impediment to forbid me to conclude, that in the conſtitution of our ſtate no war for Religion is accounted a lawfull war; for that it ſhould be lawfull to kill whole multitudes without any enditement, yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For this war to be waged, not againſt Popery, truly ſo called, but againſt the onely true Proteſtant Religion, as it ſtands (and by attempting to make new laws is acknowledged as yet to ſtand) eſtabliſht by the old Laws of the land, and therefore is fain to be called Popiſh (and our Martyr reformers notable, by thoſe fiery chariots of theirs, to get out of the confines of Babylon) that it may be fit to be deſtroyed; juſt as the Primitive Chriſtians were by the perſecuters put in wilde beaſts skins that in thoſe ſhapes they might be devoured: this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe is to me a complication of riddles (and therefore put by ſome Artiſts under that deepe, dark phraſe, and title of fundamentall Laws of the kingdome) to which certainly no liberty or right of the ſubject in <hi>Magna charta,</hi> no nor legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative power, will enable any man to give any intelligible, much leſſe legall name: At which I profeſſe I am not ill pleaſed, becauſe this I hope will keep it from being recorded to poſterity.</p>

Which yet there is uſed as a main aggravation of that ſin, for which, ſaith the Apoſtle there remaines no more ſacrifice, ver. 26. It is apparent that the phraſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> guilty of the body, &amp;c. Is paralled to the Latine <hi>Reus Maieſtatis</hi> uſed for a Traitour, and ſure ſignifies no leſſe then a guilt of a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to Chriſt, which how any man can affirme to be a ſin to which no damnation belongs (ſuppoſing no antidote of invincible ignorance or weakneſſe, nor reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very by repentance nor gracious pardon of God in not imputing ſome ſingle act of it) I profeſſe my ſelf not to diſcerne, though I think I have weighed imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally all that is ſaid of it. This ſure will keep the firſt proof from being any longer probable, and for the ſecond, (or firſt of <hi>Volkelius</hi>) it is already in effect anſwered too, for though he that is guilty onely of ſome one act of this ſinne found mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, yet ſure they that are guilty of the cuſtomary ſin, may ſpeed worſe, and indeed of all indefinitly the Apoſtle ſpeaks according to the merit of the ſin, as when he ſaith the drunkard and adulterer ſhall not inherit the kingdome of God. Where yet perhaps he that is guilty onely of one ſuch act may finde mercy. For the laſt proofe, I conceive it ſo far from being a probable one againſt me, that I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it a convincing one on my ſide, for if thoſe that were ſick, &amp;c. Were cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtened of the Lord, that they ſhould not be condemned, then ſure if they had not been ſo chaſtened, nor reformed by that chaſtening, they ſhould have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo their temporall judgements may be a means through the mercy of God in Chriſt to free them from their eternall, but not an argument that eternall was not due to them, but a perfect intimation, that it was.</p>
