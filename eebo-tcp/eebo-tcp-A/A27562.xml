            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

HENRY
Lord Biſhop of LONDON,
One of His MAJESTY's
Moſt Honourable PRIVY COUNCIL.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOVR Lordſhip having ſignified your pleaſure
that the <hi>Sermon</hi> which you heard, when you
did us the honour to be preſent at the Open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our Pariſh Church, ſhould be made
publick; notwithſtanding my averſeneſs to
print any thing in Engliſh, yet out of a just ſenſe both of
that Obedience which I owe to You as my Biſhop, and of that
Kindneſs which I have received from You as my Patron,
I have now done it, and herewith make bold to preſent it to
You. What Effect a Diſcourſe of this Nature will have
upon the Minds of thoſe who ſhall have ſo much patience as
to read it, I know not. But muſt leave that to him who
hath the hearts of all men in his hand. My Subject I am
ſure is good and neceſſary: And as for my plain and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
way of handling it, it is that which my Text re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth,
in that it commandeth that in our Chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations,
<hi>All things be done to edifying.</hi> So that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
I had endeavoured to ſuit it to the Capacities of all
there preſent, and to make it as edifying as I could unto
them, my Sermon had been a Contradiction to my Text:
And beſides that, I had loſt my Deſign in Preaching it:
Which was, to convince thoſe eſpecially, whoſe Souls, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your Lordſhip, are committed to my care and conduct,
<pb facs="tcp:49025:3"/>
of the <hi>Excellency and Uſefulneſs of the Common Prayer,</hi>
and ſo to perſwade them to the constant and conſciencious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe
of it; not only becauſe it is conformable to the Doctrine,
Diſcipline, and Practice of the Vniverſal Church, nor
only becauſe it is eſtabliſhed by the Laws both of our
Church and State (though they alſo be very great Reaſons)
but likewiſe becauſe of that extraordinary benefit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
which they would receive from it, for the edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their Souls in whatſoever is neceſſary to their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
Salvation.</p>
            <p>I am very ſenſible, that much more might have been
ſaid upon this Excellent Subject. But intending no more
than a plain Sermon upon the occaſion, I was forced to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
many things, and to confine my ſelf to ſuch only, which
were moſt obvious, and ſeemed the moſt neceſſary for peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to know and practice, in order to their being reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
unto, and edified by our Publick Prayers. And if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
your peruſal of that little which I have ſaid, you ſhall
find any thing not agreeable to the Doctrine of our Church,
I humbly ſubmit it to Your Lordſhips Judgment and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
only deſiring that You would be as ready to pardon,
as I am to retract it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lord,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have one requeſt more to make unto You, which is, that
as You was the occaſion of my printing this Sermon, ſo You
would be pleaſed to accept of it, now it is printed: And if,
by the Bleſſing of Almighty God, it may contribute any
thing to thoſe great Ends, which You continually proſecute
with ſo great Wiſdom and Prudence, with ſuch exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Care and Diligence in the Management of that high Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
which he hath called you to, even to the Glory of his
great Name, the Good of his Church, and the Salvation of
the Souls of Men; it is all that is deſired by</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN <hi>Judas Maccabeus</hi> had
new built the Altar, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
the Temple at <hi>Hieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
after it had been pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and laid waſte for Three
years together, the Church of
God at that time and place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced
ſo much at it, that they
kept the Dedication of it Eight
days, and ordered that the
ſame ſhould be obſerved every
year; 1 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 4. 59. And ſo we find it was in our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
time, for he himſelf was pleaſed to honour that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:49025:4"/>
Feſtival, though onely of Eccleſiaſtical Inſtitution, with
his own preſence; <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 22. In the like manner, we
of this Pariſh, have cauſe to be tranſported with joy and
gladneſs, and to ſpend this day in praiſing and adoring
the moſt high God, for that our Church, which hath lain
waſte for above five times Three years, is now at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>built
and fitted again for his Worſhip and Service. For
what the Altar and Temple were to the Jews then, the
ſame will our Church be unto us now. Did they there
offer up their Sacrifices to God as Types of the Death of
Chriſt? We ſhall here commemorate the ſaid Death of
Chriſt, typified by thoſe Sacrifices. Did they come from
all parts of <hi>Judea</hi> to worſhip God there? So ſhall we, I
hope, come from all parts of his Pariſh to worſhip God
here. Was the Temple an Houſe of Prayer to them? So
is the Church to us. Was that the Place where God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Promiſe came unto his people to bleſs them?
I do not doubt but he will do the ſame to us in this place,
if we come unto it, and carry our ſelves in it as we
ought to do. In ſhort, was the Temple the place where all
things were performed that could any way conduce to the
Edifying of Gods people, as things then ſtood? The ſame
may be ſaid of our Church, as things now ſtand. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
is or can be neceſſary to the Edifying of our Souls
here, and ſo to their Eternal Salvation hereafter, is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and fully comprehended in thoſe ſeveral Offices,
which according to the Laws of the Land, are now to
be performed in this place. Neither is there any thing
contained in any of them, but what doth really conduce
to thoſe great Ends and Purpoſes.</p>
            <p>But this being a thing which is denied by ſome, and
underſtood but by few amongſt us, I ſhall endeavour to
explain and demonſtrate it unto all. Which I chuſe to do
at this time, becauſe it is the moſt proper Subject I could
think of for this Occaſion. For unleſs what is to be now
done in this place, will anſwer the ends wherefore it is
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49025:4"/>
erected, all the Coſts and Charges that have been laid
out upon it, will be to no purpoſe at all. But if it can
be fully made out, That the Service which is here to be
performed, doth highly conduce to the Advancement of
Gods Glory and your Happineſs, the great Ends where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſuch Places are erected, then you cannot but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
that whatſoever any of you have contributed
towards it, is the beſt Money that you ever ſpent; and
that this day wherein the ſaid Service is begun to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in it, is one of the moſt joyful days that this Pariſh
ever ſaw.</p>
            <p>This therefore is that which I ſhall endeavour to prove
at this time: And for that end have choſen theſe
words for the ground and foundation of all that I ſhall
ſay upon this ſubject, <hi>Let all things be done to Edifying.</hi>
For the right underſtanding whereof, we muſt know, that
the Apoſtle having in this Chapter diſcourſed at large
concerning the way and manner of holding Chriſtian Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies,
and having proved that whatſoever is there ſaid
ought to be ſpoken in ſuch a Language, that all there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
may underſtand, and ſo be edified by it; he at laſt
ſums up the whole in this Propoſition, <hi>How is it then
Brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath
a Pſalm, hath a Doctrine, hath a Tongue, hath a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
hath an Interpretation. Let all things be done
to Edifying:</hi> As if he ſhould have ſaid, Whatſoever gifts
any of you have or pretend to, yet when you meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
upon a Religious Account, for the Publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of God, take ſpecial care that all things be there
done, to the Edifying of all who are there preſent. From
whence it is plain that the Apoſtle lays down this as a
general Rule, neceſſary to be obſerved in all Chriſtian
Congregations. So that whenſoever we meet together
to Worſhip and Serve God, if any thing be there done
which is not for our Edification, we come ſhort of this
Rule; and ſo we do too, if any thing be there wanting
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:49025:5"/>
that may conduce to that end. For according to this
Rule, as nothing is to be there done but what is for our
Edifying, ſo alſo on the other ſide, all things that are or
can be for our Edifying ought to be there done.</p>
            <p>But for our better underſtanding the true ſenſe and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of this Rule, it is neceſſary to conſider what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
here means by <hi>edifying?</hi> For which we muſt know,
That all Chriſtians being, as the ſame Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>of
the Houſhold of God, built upon the foundation of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
and Prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the
chief Corner Stone;</hi> Eph. 2. 19, 20. Hence whatſoever
tends to the ſtrengthening, ſupporting, cementing, or rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
this Fabrick higher, whatſoever it is whereby men
are made more firm and ſolid Chriſtians, more holy and
perfect men than they were before, by that they are ſaid
to be edified. And therefore it is a great miſtake for men
to think, as many do, that they are edified by what they
hear, meerly becauſe they know perhaps ſome little thing
which before they were ignorant of. For <hi>Knowledg,</hi> as
the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>puffeth up;</hi> it is <hi>Charity that edifieth;</hi>
1 Cor. 8. 1. And therefore whatſoever knowledg we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to, we cannot be ſaid to be edified by it, any further
than as it influenceth our minds, excites our love, and
inclines our hearts to God and goodneſs. And that this
is the true notion of edifying, is plain from the Apoſtles
own words, where he ſaith, <hi>Let no corrupt communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
come out of your mouths, but that which is for the uſe
of edifying, that it may miniſter grace unto the hearers;</hi>
Eph. 4. 29. For from hence it is manifeſt, that that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
is properly ſaid to edifie, that miniſters grace unto us,
whereby we are made more pure and holy than we were
before. And therefore we read of <hi>edifying our ſelves in
love,</hi> Eph. 4. 16. and <hi>building up our ſelves in our most
holy faith,</hi> Jude 20. which are the two graces that make
up a real and true Chriſtian. And nothing can be ſaid to
edifie, but what tends to the exciting and increaſing of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:49025:5"/>
them: <hi>Vntil we come</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>in the unity
of the faith, and of the knowledg of the Son of God, unto
a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Chriſt;</hi> Eph. 4. 12, 13. Hence therefore, when
the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Let all things be done to edifying,</hi> his
meaning in brief is this, that in all our Chriſtian Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
when we meet together to worſhip and ſerve God,
All things there are to be ſo done, that we may return
home wiſer and better than we came thither, with our
knowledg of God and Chriſt increaſed, our deſires inlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
our love inflamed, our faith confirmed, all our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
quickened, and ſo our whole ſouls made more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
more holy, more like to God, than they were before.</p>
            <p>The words being thus briefly explained, I ſhall now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
them to our preſent purpoſe, and ſhew that that Form
of Religious Worſhip, which is preſcribed by our Church,
eſtabliſhed by the Laws of the Land, and therefore to be
uſed now in this place, agrees exactly with this Rule or
Canon of the holy Apoſtle, even that <hi>all things in it are
done to edifying.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before we prove that that Form in particular which
our Church hath preſcribed, is agreeable to this Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical
Rule, it is neceſſary to prove firſt, That the preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
a Form in general is ſo. For unleſs the preſcribing a
Form in general be according to this Rule, no Form in
particular that is preſcribed can poſſibly agree with it. But
now that this Rule admits, yea requires the preſcribing
of ſome Form; is evident from the Rule it ſelf. For the
Apoſtle here commands the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and ſo all
Provincial Churches, to take care that in their Religious
Aſſemblies <hi>all things be done to edifying.</hi> But how is it
poſſible for any Provincial Church to ſee that this be done,
except ſhe preſcribes ſome certain Form for the doing of
it? If every Miniſter of a Pariſh ſhould be left to his own
liberty, to do what he pleaſed in his own Congregation,
although ſome perhaps might be ſo wiſe and prudent as to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:49025:6"/>
obſerve this Rule, as well as they could, yet conſidering
the Corruption of Humane Nature, we have much cauſe
to fear that others would not. At leaſt the Church could
be no way ſecured that all would; and therefore muſt
needs be obliged to conſider of and appoint ſome ſuch Form
to be uſed in all her Congregations, by which ſhe may be
fully aſſured that this Apoſtolical Rule is every where ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
as it ought to be. And although we ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
what can never be expected, that all the Clergy in
every Province ſhould be as wiſe and good as they ought
to be, yet it cannot be ſuppoſed that every one of them
ſhould underſtand what is for the Edification of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as well as all together. And therefore it muſt needs
be acknowledged that the ſureſt way to have this Rule ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
is for the Governours of every Church, and the
whole Clergy to meet together by their Repreſentatives,
in a Synod or Convocation, and there upon mature De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation
agree upon ſome ſuch Form, which they in their
Prudence and Conſciences judge to be according to this
Rule, which the Apoſtle here lays down before them.</p>
            <p>And beſides, that the preſcribing a Form in general, is
more for our Edifying, than to leave every one to do
what ſeems good in his own Eyes, We have the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Teſtimony, Experience, and Practice of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal
Church. For we never read or heard of any
Church in the World from the Apoſtles days to ours,
but what took this courſe. Though all have not uſed the
ſame, yet no Church but hath uſed ſome Form or other.
And therefore for any man to ſay, That it is not lawful,
or not expedient, or not ſo edifying to uſe a Form of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in the Publick Worſhip of God, is to contradict the
general ſenſe of Chriſtianity, to condemn the Holy
Catholick Church, and to make himſelf wiſer than all
Chriſtians that ever were before him. Which, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it may be thought now, was always heretofore recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
one of the greateſt ſins and follies that a Man could
be guilty of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:49025:6"/>
Nay more than all this too: For this is not only to
make a Mans ſelf wiſer than all Chriſtians, but wiſer than
Chriſt himſelf: For it is impoſſible to preſcribe any Form
of Prayer in more plain and expreſs Terms than he hath
done it, where he ſaith, <hi>When ye Pray, ſay, Our Father
which art in Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 2. And I hope none
here preſent but will acknowledge that Chriſt, by whom
alone we can be edified, knows better what is, or what
is not for our Edification, than we or all the Men in the
World can do. And therefore ſeeing he hath not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
a Form of Prayer for his Diſciples to uſe, but hath
expreſly commanded them to uſe it; we who profeſs our
ſelves to be his Diſciples, ought to reſt fully ſatisfied in
our minds, that the uſing of a Form of Prayer, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
lawful, but much more for our edifying, than it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for any other way of praying to be.</p>
            <p>The ſame may be proved alſo from the nature of the
thing it ſelf, by ſuch Arguments, which do not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate
that it is ſo, but likewiſe ſhew how it comes
to be ſo. For, Firſt, In order to our being edified, ſo as
to be made better and holier, whenſoever we meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon a Religious account, it is neceſſary that the
ſame good and holy things be always inculcated and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
upon us after one and the ſame manner. For we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but all find by our own experience how difficult it is
to faſten any thing that is truly good either upon our
ſelves or others, and that it is rarely, if ever effected,
without frequent repetitions of it. Whatſoever good
things we hear only once, or now and then, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
upon the hearing of them, they may ſwim for a
while in our Brains, yet they ſeldom ſink down into our
hearts, ſo as to move and ſway the affections, as it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
they ſhould do, in order to our being edified by
them. Whereas by a Set Form of Publick Devotions
rightly compoſed, as we are continually put in mind of
all things neceſſary for us to know or do, ſo that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:49025:7"/>
done by the ſame words and expreſſions, which by
their conſtant uſe will imprint the things themſelves ſo
firmly in our minds, that it will be no eaſie matter to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate
or race them out; but do what we can, they will
ſtill occur upon all occaſions; which cannot but be very
much for our Chriſtian Edification.</p>
            <p>Moreover, That which conduceth to the quickening
our ſouls, and to the raiſing up of our affections in our
Publick Devotions, muſt needs be acknowledged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
much to our Edification. But it is plain, that as to
ſuch purpoſes a Set Form of Prayer is an extraordinary help
to us; for if I hear another pray, and know not before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
what he will ſay, I muſt firſt liſten to what he will
ſay next, then I am to conſider whether what he ſaith be
agreeable to Sound Doctrine, and whether it be proper
and lawful for me to joyn with him in the Petitions he
puts up to Almighty God, and if I think it is ſo, then I
am to do it. But before I can well do that, he is got to
another thing: by which means it is very difficult, if not
morally impoſſible, to joyn with him in every thing ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
as I ought to do. But by a Set Form of Prayer all
this trouble is prevented; for having the Form continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in my mind, being thorowly acquainted with it,
fully approving of every thing in it, and always knowing
before-hand what will come next, I have nothing elſe to
do while the words are ſounding in mine ears, but to
move my heart and affections ſuitably to them, to raiſe
up my deſires of thoſe good things which are prayed for;
to fix my mind wholly upon God, whileſt I am praiſing
of him, and ſo to employ, quicken, and lift up my whole
ſoul in performing my Devotions to him. No man that
hath been accuſtomed to a Set Form for any conſiderable
time, but may eaſily find this to be true by his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience:
And by conſequence, that this way of Praying
is a greater help to us, than they can imagine that never
made tryal of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:49025:7"/>
To this may be alſo added, That if we hear another
praying a Prayer of his own private Compoſition or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Effuſion, our minds are wholly bound up and
confined to his words and expreſſions, and to his Requeſts
and Petitions, be they what they will: So that at the
beſt we can but Pray his Prayer. Whereas when we Pray
by a Form Preſcribed by the Church, we Pray the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of the whole Church we live in, which are common
to the Miniſter and People, to our Selves, and to all the
Members of the ſame Church: So that we have all the
Devout and Pious Souls that are in it, concurring and
joyning with us in them: Which cannot ſurely but be
more effectual for the Edifying not only of our ſelves in
particular, but of the Church in general, than any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Prayer can be.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, In order to our being Edified by our Publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions,
as it is neceſſary that we know before-hand what
we are to pray for, ſo it is neceſſary that we afterwards
know what we have prayed for, when we have done.
For I ſuppoſe you will all grant, that all the good and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
we can receive from our Prayers, is to be ultimately
reſolved into Gods gracious hearing and anſwering of
them: Without which they will all come to nothing. But
there are two things required to the obtaining an Anſwer
of our Prayers: Firſt, That we ſincerely and earneſtly
deſire ſuch good things at the hands of God, to which,
as I have ſhewn, a Set Form of Prayer conduceth very
much: And then Secondly, It is required alſo that we
truſt and depend upon God for his granting of them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Promiſes which he hath made unto us in
Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. And I verily believe that one
great Reaſon why Men Pray ſo often to no purpoſe, is,
becauſe they do not take this courſe: But when they
have done their Prayers, they have done with them, and
concern themſelves no more about them, then as if they
had never prayed at all. But how can we expect that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:49025:8"/>
God ſhould anſwer our Prayers, when we our ſelves do
not mind whether he anſwer them or no? Nor believe
and truſt upon him for it? For certainly truſting on God,
as it is one of the higheſt Acts of Religion that we can
perform, ſo it is that which gives life and vigour, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and efficacy to our Prayers, without which we have
no ground at all to expect they ſhould be anſwered. For
God having promiſed to anſwer our Prayers, except we
truſt on him for his performance of ſuch Promiſes, we
loſe the benefit of them, and by conſequence our Prayers
too. And therefore as ever we deſire that he ſhould
grant us what we pray for, when we have directed our
prayers to him, we muſt ſtill look up, <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l.</hi> 5. 3. expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and hoping for the return of them.</p>
            <p>Now as this is a thing of greater conſequence, ſo a Set
Form of Prayer is a greater help to us in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, than it is
commonly thought to be. For if we hear another utter
a prayer <hi>extempore,</hi> which he never ſaid, nor we heard
before, nor ever ſhall do it again, it is much if he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
can remember the tenth part of what he ſaid; how
much leſs can we that heard him do it? And if we cannot
poſſibly remember what we prayed for, how is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for us to expect it at the hands of God? Or to depend
upon him for it? But now it is quite otherwiſe when we
uſe a Set Form of Prayer. For by this means when we
have prayed, we can recollect our ſelves, look over our
prayers again, either in a Book, or in our minds,
where they are imprinted; we can conſider diſtinctly
what we have asked at the hands of God, and ſo act our
faith and confidence on him, for the granting every peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
we have put up unto him, according to the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
which he hath made us to that purpoſe. And as this is
the ſureſt way whereby to obtain what we pray for, it
muſt needs be the moſt edifying way of praying that we
can poſſibly uſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being duly weighed, I ſhall now take it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:49025:8"/>
for granted, That the uſing a Form in general in the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Worſhip of God, is agreeable to this Apoſtolical
Rule, <hi>Let all things be done to edifying;</hi> and ſo ſhall
proceed to ſhew that that Form in particular which our
Church hath appointed to be uſed upon ſuch occaſions, is
ſo too. For which end it is not neceſſary that I ſhould
run through every particular word, phraſe, or expreſſion
in the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> much leſs that I ſhould vindicate
and defend it from every little exception, that ignorance
or malice may make againſt ſomething in it. For nothing
ever yet was or can be ſaid or written, but ſomething or
other may be ſaid or written againſt it, either well or ill.
But my buſineſs muſt be to prove, That the Form of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Service, contained in the Book of <hi>Common Prayer,</hi>
which is now uſed in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> conduceth
ſo much to the edifying thoſe that uſe it, that it agrees
exactly with the Rule which the Apoſtle here preſcribes in
that caſe. And this I ſhall demonſtrate from Four Heads.
1. <hi>From the Language. 2. From the Matter or Subſtance of
it. 3. From the Method.</hi> And 4. <hi>From the Manner of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
it.</hi> For if it be edifying in all theſe reſpects, it muſt
needs be acknowledged to be ſo in the whole. There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing in it, but what may be reduced to theſe Heads.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Therefore as to the Language, you all know
that the whole Service is performed in Engliſh, the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
and Common Language of the Nation, which every
one underſtands, and ſo may be edified by it. And this
indeed is the ground and foundation of all the benefit that
we can poſſibly receive from our Publick Prayers. And
therefore in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the Common People
are made uncapable of being edified by the prayers of
their Church, in that they are all made in Latine, a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
which they do not underſtand. So that when they
meet to worſhip God, there are ſeldom any in the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
that knows what is ſaid there, except the Prieſt that
reads it; and oftentimes not he neither. By which means
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:49025:9"/>
they have no ſuch thing really amongſt them as <hi>Common
Prayer.</hi> Neither is it poſſible for the Common People
to be ever edified by what is there ſaid or done, except
they would be once convinced by it of the horrible abuſe
which their Church puts upon them, in commanding all
her Publick Devotions to be performed in an unknown
Tongue, directly contrary not only to the Rule in my
Text, but to the Deſign of this whole Chapter.</p>
            <p>But bleſſed be God for it, it is not ſo with us. For ours
is truly <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> for it is written and read in that
Language which is common to all the Congregations in
the Kingdom, and to every perſon in each Congregation.
So that all the People of the land, whatſoever rank or
condition they are of, may joyn together in the uſe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
thing that is in it, and ſo be joyntly Edified by it.
Eſpecially conſidering that it is not only all in Engliſh, but
in common and plain Engliſh, ſuch as we uſe in our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
diſcourſe with one another. There are no unuſual
or obſolete words, no hard or uncouth Phraſes in it, but
every thing is expreſſed as cleerly and plainly as words
can do it: ſo that the meaneſt perſon in the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that underſtands but his Mothers Tongue, may be
Edified by it, as well as the greateſt Scholar.</p>
            <p>But that which is chiefly to be conſidered in the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> is, that it is not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
but proper too. Though the words there uſed be
all but common words, yet they are ſo uſed that they
properly expreſs the things that are deſigned by them.
This I confeſs may ſeem to be no great matter at firſt ſight,
yet it is that without which we might be ſubverted by
that which was intended for our Edification. For Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
of Speech in matters of Religion, hath given oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
to all or moſt of the Schiſms, Errors and Hereſies
that ever infeſted this or any other Church; as might
eaſily be demonſtrated. Hence the Apoſtle gave <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
a <hi>Form of ſound words,</hi> and charged him to hold it
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49025:9"/>
faſt. <hi>Hold faſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Form of ſound words which
thou haſt heard of me,</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 13. As knowing that
except the words whereby he uſually expreſſed Divine
Truths, were ſound and proper, it would be impoſſible
for his Notions and Opinions of the things themſelves to
be ſo. And certainly if ever there was a Form of Sound
Words, compoſed by men ſince the Apoſtles times, our
<hi>Common Prayer</hi> may juſtly deſerve that Title. It being
all made up of ſuch fit and proper, ſuch ſound and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
words, that if we do but hold faſt to them, there is
no fear of our falling either into Hereſy or Schiſme. For
they, being duly conſidered, will ſuggeſt to our minds
right and true Apprehenſions of all the Articles of our
Chriſtian Religion; and ſo not only make us ſound<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
build us up ſtrong and firm in our moſt holy Faith. So that
conſidering the plainneſs and perſpicuity, the ſoundneſs
and propriety of Speech which is uſed in it, the leaſt
that can be ſaid of the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> is that all things
in it are ſo worded, as is moſt for the edifying of all thoſe
that uſe it.</p>
            <p>And as the words in the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> are all as edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
as words can be, ſo, in the Second place, Is the
Matter expreſſed by thoſe words. For there is nothing in
it, but what is neceſſary for our Edification, and all things
that are or can be for our Edification are plainly in it.
Firſt, I ſay there is nothing in our Liturgy but what is
neceſſary for our Edification. There are no ſuch <hi>Fables</hi>
in it, or <hi>endleſs Genealogies,</hi> which, as the Apoſtle
ſaith, <hi>Miniſter queſtions, rather than godly edifying,
which is in faith;</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 4. There are none of thoſe
vain Diſputations and impertinent Controverſies, which
have of late been raiſed in the Church, to its great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance,
rather than its edification. There are no New
Opinions, nor Airy Speculations in it, which ſerve only
to tickle mens ears and pleaſe their fancies, and ſo divert
their thoughts from what they are about. Look it all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:49025:10"/>
without prejudice and partiality, conſider ſeriouſly
every thing that is in it, and you will find nothing aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
but what is conſonant to Gods Word, nothing pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for but according to his promiſe, nothing required as
a duty, but what is agreeable to his Commands; nothing
ſaid or done, but what is grave and ſober, ſolemn and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial;
nothing but what becomes the Worſhip of our
Great and Almighty Creator. And therefore nothing but
what we may be ſome way or other edified by.</p>
            <p>And as there is nothing in it, but what is edifying, ſo
all things that are or can be edifying are in it. For nothing
can be neceſſary to edifie and make us ſolid and perfect
Chriſtians, but what is neceſſary either to be <hi>believed</hi> or
<hi>done,</hi> or elſe <hi>obtained</hi> by us. But there is nothing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
to be <hi>known</hi> or <hi>believed,</hi> but we are taught it; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
neceſſary to be <hi>done,</hi> but we are enjoyned it; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
neceſſary to be <hi>obtained,</hi> but we pray for it, in our
Publick Form of Divine Service.</p>
            <p>For firſt, As to thoſe things which are neceſſary to be
<hi>known or believed,</hi> it is acknowledged by all Proteſtants,
that they are fully contained in the Holy Scriptures, which
make a great, if not the greateſt part of our Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and are conſtantly read over, the Pſalms once eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Month, the Old Teſtament once, and the New thrice
every Year. And all the Fundamental Articles of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Faith, revealed in the Holy Scriptures, being briefly
ſummed up in the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> that we may be
ſure to keep them always in our minds, we have that
Creed read and repeated, always once and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
twice every day in the year. And ſeeing the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
of our Bleſſed Savionr, the Foundation of our whole
Religion, hath been and ſtill is, denied by ſome, leaſt
we ſhould be lead away with the Error of the Wicked, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Sunday and Holyday we read the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi>
wherein the God-head both of the Son and Holy Ghoſt is
aſſerted and explained. And that we may not entertain
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:49025:10"/>
any Erroneous Opinions concerning the moſt Holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or the Incarnation of the Son of God, but keep the
true Catholick Faith whole and undefiled, upon certain
days every year, we read that which is commonly called
the <hi>Creed of St. Athanaſius,</hi> wherein thoſe great Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
are unfolded in the moſt proper and perſpicuous terms
that they are capable of.</p>
            <p>And as all things neceſſary to be believed are ſummari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
contained in the Three Creeds, ſo they are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
explained in the other parts of our Liturgy: In ſo much
that it would be eaſie to frame a compleat Body of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
out of the words there uſed: At leaſt of all ſuch things
as are needful for any man in the world to believe or
know, in order to his Eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>The ſame may be ſaid alſo of all thoſe things, which
we ought to do. For as we here do whatſoever is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to be done in order to our Worſhipping of God in this
place, ſo we are here taught whatſoever is neceſſary to be
learnt in order to our ſerving God in all other places. So
that no Man that frequents our publick Congregations,
where the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> is uſed, can ever plead igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of any one duty whatſoever: For if it be not his
own fault, he may there be inſtructed in every thing
which he that made him requires of him. For here, as
I obſerved before, we conſtantly read the Holy Scriptures,
which, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Is profitable for Doctrine,
for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,
that the Man of God may be perfect, throughly
inſtructed unto all good works,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. 16, 17. And
ſeeing it hath pleaſed the moſt high God to compriſe his
whole will, and by conſequence our duty, in the <hi>Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi>
hence we read them conſtantly every Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
and Holy day throughout the whole year. By which
means every one that doth not wilfully ſhut his eyes,
may clearly ſee and fully underſtand his whole duty both
to God and Man. Eſpecially conſidering that in the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:49025:11"/>
themſelves alſo there is frequent mention made of
all thoſe Vices which ought to be avoided, and of all thoſe
Good Works which ought to be performed by us. So that
we can never come to Church, but we are ſtill put in
mind, both of <hi>what we ought,</hi> and <hi>what we ought not</hi> to
do, that we may be ſaved.</p>
            <p>And then as there is nothing neceſſary to be known or
done, but we are taught it; ſo neither is there any thing
neceſſary to be obtained to make us either holy or happy,
but we pray for it in the <hi>Common Prayer.</hi> For here we
have the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> a Prayer compoſed by Wiſdom it
ſelf; and therefore it muſt needs be the moſt perfect and
divine Prayer that was ever made. Neither do we uſe it
only once, but in every diſtinct Service of the Church, in
our Prayers before we read the Holy Scriptures: And in
our Prayers after: Towards the end of the Litany, and in
the beginning of the Communion Service, and in every
Office of the Church beſides. And the reaſon is, becauſe
although our Saviour hath not forbidden us to uſe any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Prayers, yet he hath expreſly commanded us to ſay
this, whenſoever we pray. And therefore in obedience
to his Command, our Church hath wiſely ordered, That
in all and every Solemn Addreſs that we make to the moſt
high God, we always ſay this Prayer, leaſt otherwiſe
by our tranſgreſſion of his Command, in omitting this, we
make all our other Prayers to be ineffectual. And beſides,
by the conſtant uſe of this amongſt our other Prayers, we
are always ſure to uſe one Prayer, both abſolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
in its ſelf, and moſt acceptable unto him, to whom
we pray, it being a Prayer of his own Compoſure: So
that we ſpeak unto God in his own words, and ſo may
be confident that we ask nothing of him, but exactly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his own will.</p>
            <p>And though all things neceſſary for us, be vertually
contained in the Lords Prayer, yet our Church in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
to the Catholick and Apoſtolical, hath thought
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:49025:11"/>
good to add ſome other Prayers in which the ſame things
are more particularly expreſſed and deſired at the hands of
our great and moſt Bountiful Benefactor. All which
are ſo contrived, that there is nothing evil or hurtful for
us, but we pray againſt it; nothing good or uſeful, but
we pray for it. There is no Vice or Luſt, but we deſire
it may be ſubdued under us; no Grace or Vertue, but
we pray it may be planted and grow in us. In ſo much
that if we do but conſtantly and ſincerely pray over all
thoſe Prayers, and ſtedfaſtly believe and truſt in God for
his anſwering of them, and ſo obtain what we there pray
for, we cannot but be as real and true Saints, as happy
and bleſſed Creatures, as it is poſſible for us to be in this
World. Neither do we here pray for our ſelves only, but
according to the Apoſtles Advice, we make <hi>Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Prayers, Interceſſions,</hi> and <hi>giving of Thanks for
all Men;</hi> yea <hi>for our very Enemies,</hi> as our Saviour hath
commanded us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 44. And what can be deſired
more than all this, to make the matter of the <hi>Common
Prayer</hi> Edifying either to our ſelves or others? Nothing
certainly but truth and ſincerity of heart in the uſing
of it.</p>
            <p>I cannot paſs from this Head, before I have obſerved
one thing more unto you, concerning the Prayers in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and that is, That they are not carried on in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
Diſcourſe, but divided into many ſhort Prayers
or Collects, ſuch as that is which our Lord himſelf Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed;
and that might be one Reaſon, wherefore our
Church ſo ordered it, that ſo ſhe might follow our Lords
Example in it, who beſt knew what kind of Prayers were
fitteſt for us to uſe. And indeed we cannot but all find
by our own experience, how difficult it is to keep our
our minds long intent upon any thing, much more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſo great things as the object and ſubjects of our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are; but do what we can, we are ſtill liable to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions:
So that there is a kind of neceſſity to break off
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49025:12"/>
ſometimes, to give our ſelves a breathing time, that our
thoughts being looſened for a while, they may with more
eaſe, and leſs danger of diſtraction, be tyed up again, as
it is neceſſary they ſhould be all the while that we are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
Praying to the Supream Being of the World.</p>
            <p>Beſides that, in order to the performing our Devotions
aright to the moſt high God, it is neceſſary that our Souls
be poſſeſſed all along with due apprehenſions of his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and glory. To which purpoſe our ſhort Prayers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
very much, for every one of them beginning
with ſome of the properties or perfections of God, and ſo
ſuggeſting to our minds right apprehenſions of him at
firſt, it is eaſie to preſerve them in our minds during the
ſpace of a ſhort Prayer, which in a long one would be apt
to ſcatter and vaniſh away.</p>
            <p>But that which I look upon as one of the principal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
why our Publick Devotions are and ſhould be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into ſhort Collects, is this, Our Bleſſed Saviour,
we know, hath often told us, That whatſoever we ask
in his Name, we ſhall receive: And ſo hath directed us
in all our Prayers to make uſe of his Name, and to ask no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but upon the account of his Merit and Mediation
for us: upon which all our hopes and expectations from
God do wholly and ſolely depend. Hence therefore (as it
always was, ſo) it cannot but be judged neceſſary, that
the Name of Chriſt be frequently inſerted in our Prayers,
that ſo we may lift up our hearts unto him, and act our
Faith upon him for our obtaining the good things we
pray for. And ſo we ſee it is in the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> for
whatſoever it is we ask of God, we preſently add, <hi>Through
Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> or ſomething to that purpoſe.
And ſo ask nothing but according to our Lords direction,
even in his Name. And this is the reaſon that makes
our Prayers ſo ſhort; for take away the concluſion of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Collect or Prayer, in the Name of Chriſt, and you
may joyn them all together, and make them but as one
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:49025:12"/>
continued Prayer. But this would be to offer manifeſt
violence to the Prayers, by taking away that which gives
them all their force and energy, and ſo making them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual
to the purpoſes for which they are uſed. For
certainly the asking all things in the Name of Chriſt, as
we do in the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> is the only way whereby
to obtain what we deſire, and by conſequence the moſt
edifying way of Praying in the world.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be conſidered in the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi>
is the Method, which is admirable, and as Edifying, if
poſſible, as the matter it ſelf. This none can deny that
doth but fully underſtand, and ſeriouſly conſider of it.
Which therefore that you may all do, I ſhall briefly run
through the whole, and give you what light I can into
it, that you may clearly ſee not only the reaſonableneſs
but the excellency of it all along. For which purpoſe I
ſhall inſtance only in ſuch things which offer themſelves at
firſt ſight, to any one that doth but caſt his eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore ſuppoſe a Congregation of ſober and
devout Chriſtians, ſuch as we all ſhould be, met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to perform their Publick Devotions to Allmighty
God; every one of which hath lift up his heart privately
unto him already, imploring his Aid and Aſſiſtance in the
performance of ſo great a work, and ſo are all now ready
to ſet about it. The firſt thing we do, is to read ſome
<hi>Sentences</hi> of Holy Scripture, that ſo we may begin our
Devotions unto God in his own words. And they are all
ſuch <hi>Sentences</hi> as put us in mind of our ſins againſt him,
and of his promiſe to pardon them if we do repent: That
ſo we may preſent and carry our ſelves with that Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and Godly Fear before him, as becometh thoſe
who are ſenſible of their own vileneſs and unworthineſs
to approach ſo great a Majeſty; and likewiſe with that
Faith and humble Confidence, which becometh thoſe
who believe that he upon our Repentance will pardon our
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49025:13"/>
ſins, and accept both our Perſons and Performances,
according to the promiſes which he hath made unto
us.</p>
            <p>Then follows a grave <hi>Exhortation,</hi> concerning the end
of our preſent Aſſembling, which is of great uſe, and
ought never to be omitted. For Men generally are apt to
ruſh into the preſence of God, without ever conſidering
what they go about. Whereas this <hi>Exhortation</hi> puts us
upon conſidering the greatneſs of the work which we are
now engaged in, and ſo upon compoſing our thoughts
and preparing our ſelves for the due performance of it.</p>
            <p>Our minds being thus brought into a right frame and
temper for it, we all, both Miniſter and People, proſtrate
our ſelves before the moſt high God, <hi>confeſſing</hi> upon our
knees the manifold ſins and wickedneſs that we have
committed againſt him. Which <hi>Confeſſion</hi> is ſo contrived,
that all and every perſon in any Congregation whatſoever
may joyn in it. For it runs in general terms. And yet
ſo too, that every particular perſon may and ought in
his own mind to confeſs and acknowledg his own ſins,
which he knows himſelf to be guilty of. As where we
ſay, <hi>We have left undone thoſe things which we ought to
have done, and we have done thoſe things which we
ought not to have done.</hi> At the ſaying of this, every one
ſhould call his own ſins to remembrance, what Duties he
knows himſelf to have omitted, and what Vices he knows
himſelf to have committed, and confeſs them according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unto God. And when we have thus confeſſed our ſins
to God, we preſently implore his Mercy in the pardon of
them, and his Grace, that for the future we may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
them.</p>
            <p>And whilſt we are thus upon our knees, humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
and bewailing our ſins before the Lord our God,
the Miniſter ſtands up, and in the Name of God, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
and pronounceth to all thoſe who truly repent,
and unfeignedly believe his Goſpel, <hi>The Abſolution and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:49025:13"/>
Remiſſion of all their ſins.</hi> Which though ſpoken alſo
in general terms, yet every particular perſon there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
ought to apply it to himſelf, ſo as to be fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
in his own mind, that if he doth but ſincerely
repent and believe the Goſpel, he is perfectly abſolved
from all his ſins by God himſelf, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
which he hath made to Mankind in Jeſus Chriſt our
Lord.</p>
            <p>And now looking upon our ſelves as abſolved from our
ſins, upon our Repentance and Faith in Chriſt, and by
conſequence as reconciled to God, we take the boldneſs
to call him Father, humbly addreſſing our ſelves to him
in that Divine Form of Prayer which he himſelf hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us. Which done, we lift up our hearts and voices
unto God, for his aſſiſtance of us in what we do, in the
words of <hi>David,</hi> the Miniſter crying out, <hi>O Lord open
thou our lips,</hi> and the People anſwering, <hi>And our mouth
ſhall ſhew forth thy praiſe.</hi> The Miniſter again, <hi>O God
make ſpeed to ſave us,</hi> the People, <hi>O Lord make haſte to
help us.</hi> And then immediately we all lift up our bodies
too, ſtand upon our feet, and ſo put our ſelves into a
poſture of praiſing and magnifying the Eternal God,
Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, for his infinite goodneſs
and mercy towards us; for which purpoſe the Miniſter
firſt ſaith or ſings the <hi>Gloria Patri, Glory be to the
Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and the
people to ſhew their conſent, anſwer, <hi>As it was in the
beginning, is now, and ever ſhall be, world without
end.</hi> Amen. But not thinking this to be enough, the
Miniſter calls upon the people again, ſaying, <hi>Praiſe ye
the Lord,</hi> and the people anſwer, <hi>The Lords name be
praiſed,</hi> and then we go on to praiſe him together, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or ſinging the 95 Pſalme, <hi>Venite exultemus Domino,
O come let us ſing unto the Lord, let us heartily rejoyce
in the ſtrength of our Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo proceed to the
Pſalms appointed for the day. After every one of which,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:49025:14"/>
to teſtifie our belief in the moſt ſacred Trinity, and our
acknowledgment of that infinite love and goodneſs, which
every one of thoſe Divine Perſons hath manifeſted to us,
we repeat that incomparable Hymne, <hi>Glory be to the
Father,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Our hearts being thus raiſed up to God in praiſing and
admiring of him, we are now in a fit temper and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to hear what he ſhall ſpeak unto us. And therefore
have a Chapter read out of the <hi>Old Teſtament;</hi> and that
in its ordinary courſe, except upon Sundays and Holydays,
when more people attending the Publick Worſhip of God
then can conveniently come upon other days, we read
ſome Select Chapter proper for the day, and ſuch as is
judged moſt edifying to all that are there preſent. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thus heard God ſpeaking unto us in his holy Word, we
preſently fall upon praiſing of him again, for ſo unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
a mercy, ſaying, or ſinging, in the Morning, the
<hi>Te Deum,</hi> one of the moſt Heavenly and Seraphick Hymns
that was ever compoſed by Men; or elſe the <hi>Song of the
Three Children,</hi> which is nothing but a Paraphraſe upon
that which <hi>David</hi> ſang ſo often upon Earth, and which
the Holy Angels ſing continually in Heaven, even <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah,
Praiſe ye the Lord.</hi> Wherein we being all ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
how far ſhort we our ſelves come of praiſing God
ſufficiently, we call upon all the Creatures in the World
to do it, <hi>Bleſs ye the Lord, praiſe him and magnifie
him for ever.</hi> In the Afternoon we ſing either the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificat,</hi>
or elſe the 98 <hi>Pſalme,</hi> both which being taken
out of Gods own Word, cannot but be very pleaſing and
acceptable unto him.</p>
            <p>After this our Souls being got upon the wing again, and
ſoaring aloft in the contemplation of the Divine perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
we are now rightly qualified to hear and receive the
Sublime Myſteries of the Goſpel. And therefore have a
Chapter read to us out of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> After
which we being revived with the good Tydings of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:49025:14"/>
Goſpel, and filled with admiration at the infinite good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of God therein revealed to us, we break forth again
into praiſing and adoring of him, in the ſong of <hi>Zachari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi>
or elſe the 100 <hi>Pſalm</hi> in the Morning, and at Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
either the 67 Pſalm, or elſe the Song of Old <hi>Simeon,</hi>
ſtill concluding with the <hi>Gloria Patri.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now having thus heard ſome part of the Word of God
read to us and expreſſed our thankfulneſs unto him for it,
to ſignifie our aſſent, not only to what we have heard,
but to the whole Scripture, we all with one heart and
voice repeat the <hi>Apoſtles Creed,</hi> wherein the ſumm and
ſubſtance of it is contained. And ſo profeſs our ſelves
to continue in the number of Chriſts Diſciples, and that
as we were at firſt Baptized, ſo we ſtill believe in the
Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, God Bleſſed
for evermore.</p>
            <p>Hitherto we have been moſtly taken up with confeſſing
our ſins to God, imploring his mercy in the pardon of
them, hearing his moſt holy Word, acknowledging his
goodneſs to us, and praiſing and magnifying his name for
it. By which means, except we have been extreamly
wanting to our ſelves, our hearts cannot but be ſo u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
and fixed upon God, that we are now rightly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to make known our wants and preſent our Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
before him. This therefore is the next thing we ſet
upon. But ſeeing that neither Miniſter nor People can
poſſibly do it aright without the aſſiſtance of God himſelf,
therefore each of them firſt pray for his ſpecial preſence
with the other. The one ſaying, <hi>The Lord be with you,</hi>
the other, <hi>And with thy ſpirit.</hi> And then immediately
falling down upon our knees, we adore and ſupplicate
each perſon of the moſt bleſſed Trinity to have mercy
upon us, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us, Chriſt have mercy
upon us, Lord have mercy upon us.</hi> After which we
addreſs our ſelves to God in the words that he hath put
into our mouths, ſaying the Lords prayer, which end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49025:15"/>
the Miniſter and People by turns lift up their hearts
to God in ſome ſhort and heavenly Ejaculations, ſtriving
as it were to outvy each other in prevailing with the
Allmighty to powr down his Bleſſings upon us. And then
in an humble and ſolemn manner we joyn together in
ſupplicating his Divine Majeſty for his Grace and Favour,
his Defence and Protection, his Mercy and Bleſſing for
our ſelves, for the King, for the Royal Family, for his
Church, and for all Mankind. And this we do ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
in the Collects appointed for that purpoſe. But upon
Wedneſdays and Fridays (upon which days the Primitive
Church uſed to perform more than their ordinary Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)
as alſo upon the Lords day in the morning, we do
it in the <hi>Litany,</hi> and in ſuch a <hi>Litany</hi> as comprehends
all and every thing that we can ever need to deſire of
Allmighty God, either for our ſelves or others.</p>
            <p>After this upon Sundays and Holydays we proceed to
the <hi>Communion Service:</hi> And therefore approaching to
the Lords Table, we begin it with his own Prayer.
And after another ſhort Prayer to God to cleanſe the
thoughts of our heart by the Inſpiration of his Holy Spirit,
we read the <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> which he hath enjoyned
us to obſerve; and after every Commandment we ask
God Mercy for our Tranſgreſſions thereof for the time
paſt, and grace to keep the ſame for the time to come;
ſaying, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us, and incline our hearts
to keep this Law.</hi> And then after a Prayer for the King,
and the Collect for the day, we read the <hi>Epistle</hi> and
<hi>Goſpel,</hi> that is, moſt commonly a ſhort Paragraph taken
out of the Cannonical Epiſtles, and another out of one of
the Holy Goſpels, which was the ancient way of Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Scripture, before it was divided into Chapters.
And we do it now to prepare us the better for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, therein reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to us. But ſeeing we neither do nor can read over the
whole, we repeat the ſubſtance of it in the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:49025:15"/>
which it is very neceſſary we ſhould do at this time, that
ſo we may demonſtrate our ſelves to be Chriſtians, and
ſo capable of receiving the moſt holy Communion.</p>
            <p>He that all this while hath employed himſelf as he
ought to do in the ſervice of our Church, cannot but
find himſelf ſtrangely edified by it. Yet howſoever, that
nothing may be wanting that may any way conduce to
our Edification, after the <hi>Nicene Creed,</hi> our Church
hath appointed a <hi>Sermon</hi> to be preached, which if ſound,
plain, and practical, as it ought to be, cannot but be
very edifying too.</p>
            <p>And now we may be well ſuppoſed to be ſo far edified,
as to be raiſed up to the higheſt pitch of Devotion that
we can arrive at in this world, and ſo are fit to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the higheſt Ordinance of the Church, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lords Supper. And therefore we now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
our ſelves to it. But that we may not appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Lord empty, we firſt offer up ſomething to him
of what he hath beſtowed upon us, to be diſpoſed of to
pious and charitable uſes; teſtifying thereby our acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
of his goodneſs to us, and that we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what we receive from him. And to excite and
encourage us to do this, all the while that we are offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
we have ſome ſelect ſentences of Scripture read to
us, wherein God either commands us to be charitable,
or elſe promiſeth a bleſſing to thoſe that are ſo. And then
we pray <hi>for Chriſts whole Church Militant here on earth,</hi>
whereby we profeſs our ſelves to be real Members of it,
and deſirous to hold Communion with it in Chriſts My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Body and Blood. And ſo we proceed to the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it: in which the method is ſo clear, ſo apparently
edifying, that I need not ſay any thing of it. But ſhall
only obſerve two things in general concerning it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, being
the higheſt Myſtery in all our Religion, as repreſenting
the death of the Son of God to us, hence that place where
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49025:16"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:49025:16"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:49025:17"/>
this Sacrament is Adminiſtred, was always made and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
the higheſt place in the Church. And therefore
alſo it was wont to be ſeparated from the reſt of the
Church by a Skreen or Partition of Network in Latine
<hi>Cancelli,</hi> and that ſo generally, that from thence the
place its ſelf is called the <hi>Chancell.</hi> That this was anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
obſerved in the building of all conſiderable Churches
(for I ſpeak not of private Oratories or Chappels) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
few Centuries after the Apoſtles themſelves, even in
the days of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, as well as in all Ages
ſince, I could eaſily demonſtrate from the Records of thoſe
times. But having purpoſely waved Antiquity hitherto,
I am loath to trouble you with it now. But I mention
it at preſent, only becauſe ſome perhaps may wonder
why this ſhould be obſerved in our Church, rather than
in all the other Churches which have been lately built in
this City. Whereas they ſhould rather wonder why it
was not obſerved in all other as well as this. For beſides
our Obligations to conform as much as may be to the
practice of the Univerſal Church, and to avoid novelty
and ſingularity in all things relating to the Worſhip of
God; it cannot be eaſily imagined that the Catholick
Church in all Ages and places for 13 or 1400 years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſhould obſerve ſuch a Cuſtom as this, except there
were great reaſons for it.</p>
            <p>What they were, it is not neceſſary for us to enquire
now. It may be ſufficient to obſerve at preſent that the
Chancel in our Chriſtian Churches, was always looked
upon as anſwering to the Holy of Holies in the Temple,
which, you know, was ſeparated from the Sanctuary or
Body of the Temple, by the Command of God himſelf.
And that this place being apppropriated to the Sacrament
of the Lords Supper, it ought to be ſo contrived, as may
be moſt convenient for thoſe who are to partake of that
Bleſſed Ordinance. But it muſt needs be more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for thoſe who are to enjoy Communion with Chriſt,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:49025:17"/>
and in him with one another, in this holy Sacrament,
to meet together, as one body, in one place ſeparated
for that purpoſe, then to be diſperſed, as otherwiſe they
would be; ſome in one and ſome in another part of the
Church. Or in ſhort, it is much better for the place to
be ſeparate, than the people.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, It is not only convenient, but in ſome
ſenſe neceſſary, for every Communicant to obſerve and
take ſpecial notice of the ſeveral Circumſtances which
our Lord hath ordained to be uſed in this Sacrament, as
the Breaking of the Bread, and the Conſecrating both
that and the Wine, to repreſent his Death, the breaking of his
Body, and the ſhedding of his Blood for our ſins; that ſo
our hearts may be the more affected with it, and by
conſequence our Souls more edified by it. But this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſo well done, except there be a place ſet apart for
it, where they may all be placed, about or near to the
Communion Table, and ſo behold what is there done at
the Conſecration of the Elements. Hence alſo it is, that
the Seats there are and ought to be ſo ordered, that all
that are in them may ſtill look that way, and contemplate
upon their Bleſſed Saviour, there evidently ſet forth as
Crucified for them.</p>
            <p>The other thing that I would obſerve unto you concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Holy Communion, is this, that our Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth,
or at leaſt ſuppoſeth it to be Adminiſtered eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Lords-day, and every Holy day throughout the year,
as it was in the Primitive Church. For that is the reaſon
that the <hi>Communion Service</hi> is appointed to be uſed upon
all ſuch days, and to be read at the Communion Table,
that ſo the Miniſter may be there ready to Adminiſter it
unto all that deſire to partake of it. Which ſhews the
great care that our Church hath of all her Members, that
they might be edified and confirmed in the Faith. To
which nothing contributes more than frequent Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at our Lords Table. Which if people could once be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:49025:18"/>
perſwaded to, they would ſoon find greater benefit by
it, then I can expreſs, or they themſelves, till then,
imagine. I ſhall ſay no more of it at preſent, but only
this, That I am ſo ſenſible of what I now ſay, that could
I be ſure to have a ſufficient number of Communicants,
I ſhould be heartily glad to Adminiſter this Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
every Lords day, both for their ſakes, and my
own too.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given you a ſhort Scheme of that excellent
Method wherein our Divine Service is performed: Which
whoſoever rightly conſiders, will need no other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to convince him, that it is according to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
Rule, very <hi>Edifying</hi> indeed. The laſt thing to be
conſidered in it, is the <hi>Manner of its Performance;</hi> by
which I mean only the ſeveral poſtures of the Body, as
<hi>ſtanding,</hi> and <hi>kneeling,</hi> which are uſed in it; for they
alſo are done to edifying.</p>
            <p>While we ſay or ſing the Hymns and Pſalms to the
Praiſe and Glory of God, we <hi>ſtand up,</hi> not only to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,
but to excite the Elevation of our minds at that time.
For as on the one hand, if our Souls be really lift up in
the praiſes of God, our Bodies will naturally lift up
themſelves, to accompany them, as far as they can to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Heaven; ſo on the other hand, the raiſing up of
our bodies helps towards the raiſing up of our Souls too,
by putting us in mind of that high and heavenly work
we are now about, wherein according to our weak Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities,
we joyn with the Quire of Heaven in praiſing
God now, as we hope to do it for evermore. For this
cauſe alſo we ſtand at the <hi>Creeds,</hi> for they being Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of our Faith in God, as ſuch, they come under the
proper Notion of Hymns or Songs of praiſe to him. All
our praiſing God being really nothing elſe but our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing
and acknowledging him to be what he is in himſelf
and to us. And beſides that, by our ſtanding both at the
<hi>Creeds</hi> and <hi>Goſpels,</hi> we ſignifie our aſſent unto them, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:49025:18"/>
our readineſs to defend them, to the utmoſt of our power
againſt all oppoſition whatſoever. And as for the <hi>Goſpels</hi>
particularly, they contain the very Acts which our Lord
did, and the very Words which he ſpake when he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth; and therefore we who profeſs him to be our
Lord and Maſter, cannot ſurely but ſtand up, when we
hear him ſpeaking, and liſten diligently to thoſe gracious
words which proceeded out of his Divine Mouth.</p>
            <p>And as when we praiſe God, we raiſe up our ſelves as
high as we can towards Heaven, ſo when we pray unto
him, we fall down as low as we can towards the Earth,
not daring to preſent our Supplications to the abſolute
Monarch of the whole World, any other ways then <hi>upon
our knees.</hi> Which is ſo proper, ſo natural a poſture of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicants,
that if all men would but duly conſider what they
do when they pray to Almighty God, the Church need
never have commanded them to kneel at that time. For
they could not chuſe but do it: No, not although the
place where they are ſhould ſeem never ſo inconvenient
for it. For we find our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf kneeling
at his Prayer in the Garden, upon the bare ground, <hi>Luke</hi>
22. 41. and St. <hi>Paul</hi> upon the Sea-ſhore, where he could
have no other Cuſhion but Stones or Sand, <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 5.
Howſoever, To take off all thoſe little excuſes that men are
apt to make for themſelves in this caſe, the Seats in this
Church are ſo diſpoſed, and all things ſo prepared in them,
that there can be no inconvenience at all in it, but rather
all the conveniences for kneeling that can be deſired. And
therefore if any of you ſhall yet neglect to kneel, while
the Prayers are read, they will give us too much cauſe
to call their Religion into queſtion, or to ſuſpect they
have none at all. For if they had, they durſt not, they
could not offer ſuch a manifeſt affront to the great Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
of the World, as to carry themſelves no otherwiſe
while they pray to him, then as if they were converſing
with their Fellow Creatures. But why do I ſpeak of their
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:49025:19"/>
praying unto God? It is too much to be feared they do
not pray at all, nor come to Church for any better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
then only to ſee and be ſeen. I am ſure they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
no Act of External Worſhip or Adoration unto God,
nor ſhew hm that reſpect and reverence which is due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him; and ſo give very great offence to all pious and
devout Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>Whereas if all and every perſon in the Congregation,
would always be upon their knees, while they put up
their petitions to the moſt high God, what a mighty ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
would this be, not onely to every one in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
but to the whole Congregation in general? For as
every one would by this means keep his heart more ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt
in the true fear and dread of God, and likewiſe more
certainly obtain the good things he prays for, as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
frequently aſſert: ſo the whole Congregation alſo,
would be very much edified by it. For by this means we
ſhould excite and inflame each others Devotions, confirm
and ſtrengthen one anothers Faith, and convince both our
ſelves and all that ſee us, that Religion is indeed a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
thing; and that we believe it to be ſo, by our ſerving
God with ſo much <hi>reverence and godly fear,</hi> as this hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
poſture repreſenteth. And therefore as you tender the
love of God, the credit of Religion, or the ſalvation of
your own ſouls, I beſeech you all in the name of him that
made you, that whenſoever you come hither to pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, you do it in that awful, lowly, and ſolemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
which our Church commandeth, and as becometh
creatures, when you ſpeak to your great and almighty
Creator; that ſo you may give true worſhip and honour
unto him, and alſo receive that benefit and edification to
your ſelves, which he hath promiſed and you expect from
your Publick Prayers. This being certainly the moſt edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
poſture that you can poſſibly uſe upon ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>From what we have hitherto diſcourſed concerning the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:49025:19"/>
               <hi>Language,</hi> the <hi>Matter,</hi> the <hi>Method,</hi> and the <hi>Manner of
Performing</hi> Divine Service, as contained and preſcribed
in the Book of <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> we may poſitively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that it agrees exactly with the Rule in my Text,
even that, <hi>All things in it are done to edifying:</hi> Which
was the thing I undertook to prove. I know that many
other Arguments might be brought to ſhew the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Uſefulneſs of the <hi>Common Prayer.</hi> But theſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
produced are ſufficient to convince any ſober and
conſidering Chriſtian of it. And if there be any here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
who are not yet convinced by what they have heard
of it, I deſire onely one thing of them, and that is, That
they would but make tryal of it for a while. For my
Charity prompts me to believe that all the Zeal that ſome
expreſs againſt the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> and all that indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency
that is in others for it, proceeds only from their
ignorance of what it is, or at leaſt from their want of an
experimental knowledg of it. For let any Man that ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
minds the Worſhip of God and the Salvation of his
Soul before all things elſe, let ſuch a one, I ſay, ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in good earneſt to uſe the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> as he ought
to do for ſome conſiderable time, and I do not doubt but
that by the bleſſing of God, he will find that benefit and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
by it, that his own experience ſhall convince him
of all that I have now ſaid, more than all the Arguments
that I have, or any man in the World can ever produce
to him. Some perhaps may think this to be a Paradox:
But I do not queſtion but that many here preſent can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
it upon their own knowledge: Having found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
more confirmed in their Faith, more ſettled in their
Religion, more humbled for their ſins, more ſupported
under their troubles, more enflamed with Love to God
and deſires of Heaven, every way more <hi>Edifyed</hi> by the
conſtant uſe of the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> than they could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
have believed it poſſible to have been, except they
had found it to have been ſo by their own experience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:49025:20"/>
Now theſe things being thus briefly conſidered; I ſhall
obſerve only two things from them. The firſt is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
prudence as well as piety of our firſt Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
who firſt compiled the Book of <hi>Common Prayer,</hi>
ſo exactly Conformable to the Word of God and that
Apoſtolical Canon in my Text; which I cannot but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
to the ſame extraordinary aid and aſſiſtance from
God, whereby they were afterwards enabled to ſuffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution,
yea Martyrdome it ſelf for his ſake, and ſo to
confirm what they have done with their own Blood.
Which certainly is no ſmall commendation of it.</p>
            <p>The other thing I would obſerve unto you, is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
why the Devil hath had ſuch a ſpight againſt the
<hi>Common Prayer,</hi> ever ſince it was firſt made. For the
more edifying it is to Gods People, the more deſtructive
it muſt needs be of the Devils Kingdom. And therefore
it is no wonder that he hath all along employed the utmoſt
of his power and policy to blaſt its Reputation, and ſo
to diſcourage and diſſwade Men from the uſe of it. And
by the permiſſion of God for the puniſhment of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful
Nation, he hath ſo far prevailed in his deſign,
that the Liturgy hath been twice caſt out of the Church,
ſince it was firſt brought into it, once in the Reign of
Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and then again in the days of King <hi>Charles</hi>
the Firſt.</p>
            <p>In the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> you all know, who were
his Inſtruments in the doing of it, even the <hi>Papiſts.</hi> For
they cleerly and truly fore-ſaw, that their Erroneous O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
could never be believed, nor their ſuperſtitious
Practices obſerved in the Nation, ſo long as the <hi>Common
Prayer</hi> was uſed. Foraſmuch as there is nothing in that
but what is ſound and agreeable to the Doctrine of the
Goſpel, and ſo contrary to the groundleſs Opinions which
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would obtrude upon the World for
Articles of Faith. And beſides that, there are many
expreſſions purpoſely inſerted in it, to arm us againſt the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:49025:20"/>
Popes Supremacy, Indulgences, Invocation of Sain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s,
Tranſubſtantiation, and other Popiſh Errors. So that it
would have been impoſſible for the Romiſh Religion to be
ever reſtored in the Nation, unleſs the <hi>Common Prayer</hi>
was firſt removed. Which therefore they took care to
have done as ſoon as poſſible. But within a few years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
even the firſt of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it was brought in
again. And as the Reformation was begun before, ſo from
that time forward it was carried on and perfected chiefly
by means of the <hi>Common Prayer.</hi> For it is very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
that in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, and for
ſeveral years too of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> there was little
or no preaching in moſt parts of the Kingdom, and few
then could read Engliſh, and yet by the conſtant and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
uſe of the Liturgy, and Gods Bleſſing upon it, the
whole Nation was ſo edified in the True Religion, that
there was ſcarce one in an hundred but forſook and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred
all Popiſh Doctrines and Superſtitions: Which is
an undeniable Argument, that in this reſpect alſo it is as
edifying, as it is poſſible for a thing of that nature to be.
In ſo much that ſo long as the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> is uſed and
frequented as it ought to be, it is morally impoſſible for
Popery to get any ground amongſt us. But if this Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark
was once removed (which God forbid) our grand
Adverſary would ſoon accompliſh his malicious deſigns
upon us, one way or other.</p>
            <p>This he knows well enough; and therefore hath left
no ſtone unturned to effect it. But what he had done
before by the Papiſts, he afterwards brought about again
by other means in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt.
For by what kind of Spirit the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> was then
caſt out, you all know, and ſome of you found by wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
experience. All that I ſhall ſay of it, is only this,
That the ſame Spirit that then ſtirred up people ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
againſt the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> ſtirr'd them up at the
ſame time to Rebel againſt their King, to take away
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:49025:21"/>
Mens Eſtates and Lives contrary to all Law and Juſtice;
and at laſt to Murther one of the moſt pious Princes that
ever lived. And whether that was the Spirit of Chriſt
or Antichriſt, God or the Devil, judge you. Be ſure the
conſequents of its being laid aſide at that time were very
ſad. For people being deprived of that whereby they
ſhould have been edified, were immediately toſſed to
and fro with every wind of Doctrine, until at length
many of them fell into the moſt pernicious and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Hereſies that were ever heard of in the Church. Yea
together with the Liturgy, they laid aſide all diſtinction
betwixt ſacred and common things; by which means
the whole Nation was in danger of being over-ſpread
with profaneneſs and irreligion.</p>
            <p>But bleſſed be the Name of the moſt high God for it,
he was once more pleaſed to appear for us, and in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
manner to reſtore our <hi>Common Prayer</hi> to his
Church, together with our Gracious Soveraign to his
Kingdoms. But what ſhall we render to the Lord for ſo
great a Bleſſing as this is? All that he expects, or we can
give him for it, is only to make the beſt uſe of it that
we can. This therefore is that which I now pray and
beſeech you all for the future to do. Do not think it
enough to be for the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> and to come now
and then to hear it. This you may do, as many do,
and yet receive no more benefit by it; than as if there
was none at all to be received. Which therefore can by
no means be imputed to the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> its ſelf, but
to the negligence of thoſe that uſe it. Neither muſt you
think it enough to talk high for it, or to rail at thoſe
who are not ſo happy as to be rightly informed about
it. But rather take all opportunities to inform them,
and by all means poſſible to convince them of the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
and Uſefulneſs of it. Which you can never do ſo
effectually, as by your out-ſtripping and exceeding them
in Vertue and Good Works. For this is and ever will be
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:49025:21"/>
a plain demonſtration, that the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
far more edifying, than thoſe new Modes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
which they are ſo unhappily ſeduced into. That
therefore you may do this, and ſo both experience in
your ſelves and demonſtrate unto others, the truth and
certainty of what you have now heard, concerning the
<hi>Common Prayer,</hi> I deſire you to obſerve theſe few Rules
in the uſing of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Come not to our Publick Prayers only out of
Cuſtom or for Faſhion ſake, as the manner of ſome is,
but out of a ſincere obedience to Gods Commands, and
with a ſure truſt and confidence in his Promiſes for his
Bleſſing upon what you do. For which end it will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
good as you go to Church, to bethink your ſelves whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
you are going, and what you are to do there, that
ſo laying aſide all other buſineſs, you may put your
ſelves into a right temper for ſo great a work.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Frequent our Publick Prayers as often as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
you can. The oftner you are at them, the
better you will like them, and the more edified you
will be by them. And therefore do not ſatisfie your ſelves
with hearing them once a Week. In this City, as alſo in
many other places of the Kingdom, eſpecially where
there are Cathedrals, or Collegiate Churches, you may
enjoy the benefit of them publickly every day, and ſo
keep your hearts continually in an holy and heavenly
frame, and always live as becometh Chriſtians: And if
you neglect ſuch opportunities as are now put into your
hands, you will one day wiſh you had not; but then
wiſhing will do no good.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If poſſible, come always at the beginning of
Divine Service. Otherwiſe you will certainly miſs of
ſomething that would have been edifying to you, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:49025:22"/>
perhaps of that, which at that time might have done
you more good than all the reſt. Neither will you loſe
the benefit only of part of it, but in ſome meaſure of
the whole too. All the parts of it being linked together
in ſo excellent a manner and method, that they influence
and aſſiſt each other. So that nothing can be omitted
either by Miniſter or People, but the whole will ſuffer by
it, and loſe ſomething of that Vertue and Efficacy, which
otherwiſe you would find in it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, All the while that you are in Gods Houſe,
carry your ſelves as in his ſpecial preſence, and ſuitably
to the work you are about; ſtanding while you praiſe
God, and kneeling while you pray unto him, as our
Church hath directed you. For though theſe may ſeem
but little things in themſelves, yet they are of great
conſequence, both to our Worſhipping of God aright,
and alſo to our being edified by what we do, as I have
ſhewed before.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Take ſpecial care all along to keep your minds
intent upon the matter in hand. When you confeſs your
ſins to God, do it with an hearty and ſincere Repentance
for all the Errors of your life paſt. When the Abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is pronounced, receive it with a firm and ſtedfaſt
Faith in Chriſt your Saviour. When you repeat or ſing
the Hymns and Pſalms, raiſe up your Spirits as high as
you can to joyn with thoſe above in praiſing and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying
the Eternal God. When the Word of God is
read, hearken diligently unto it, and conſider ſeriouſly
what he that made you ſaith to you, and requireth of
you, and reſolve by his Bleſſing to believe and live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.
And all the while that you are upon your
knees, putting up your Petitions to the moſt high God,
let your whole Souls be employed in it, earneſtly deſiring
the good things you pray for at his Gracious hands, and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:49025:22"/>
humbly confiding on his faithful Promiſes for the grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them. By this means you will perform reaſonable
ſervice unto God, and by conſequence that which will
be very acceptable unto him, and as profitable and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
to your ſelves. Whereas they that do not obſerve
this Rule, cannot be properly ſaid to pray, or ſerve God
at all. And therefore it is no wonder that they come to
Church, and hear the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> read, and yet are
no way edified by it. Indeed it is impoſſible that they
ſhould. For as much as all the benefit and edification
that we can poſſibly receive from any of our Devotions,
depends very much upon the due intention of our minds
in the performance of them. To which, as I have
ſhewn, both a Form of Prayer in general, and ours in
particular, is a very great help.</p>
            <p>Do but obſerve theſe plain and neceſſary Rules in uſing
of the <hi>Common Prayer</hi> (without which you cannot be
truly ſaid to uſe, but rather to abuſe it) and you will
ſoon find what I have ſaid about it to be true, even that
<hi>All things in it are done to Edifying.</hi> And therefore I
would to God that not only you that hear me at this
time, but all the people of the Nation could be once per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
to do ſo. What an holy Nation, what a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar
People ſhould we then become? How Pious towards
God? How Loyal to our Soveraign? How Juſt and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
to one another? For by our conſtant Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Almighty God in ſo ſolemn and devout a manner as
this is, our hearts would be over-awed with ſo great a
fear of his Divine Majeſty, that we ſhould never dare
willingly to offend him. Our minds would be filled and
impregnated with ſuch a ſenſe of his power and ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that we ſhould honour and revere it in thoſe alſo
whom he hath ſet over us. Our whole Souls would be
raiſed up ſo much above the World, that we ſhould not
do an ill act to gain it wholly to our ſelves. In ſhort,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:49025:23"/>
we ſhould be every day edified more and more in Faith,
in Love, in Humility, in Self-denial, in Temperance,
in Patience, in all true Grace and Vertue: And ſo we
ſhould go from ſtrength to ſtrength, from one degree
of grace unto another, until at length we arrive at Glory
and Perfection in the higheſt Heavens, where we ſhall
ſpend Eternity its ſelf in Praiſing and Adoring the moſt
high God; as for all the other Mercies which he hath
vouchſafed to us, ſo in a particular manner for our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Members of ſuch an Apoſtolical Church, wherein all
things are done to edifying.</p>
            <p>Which God of his Infinite Mercy grant we may all do
in and through our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, to
whom with the Father and Holy Ghoſt, be all Honour
and Glory, World without end. <hi>Amen.</hi>
