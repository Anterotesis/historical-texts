            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His ſentence that I haue redde (Dearelye beloued) contayneth fewe wordes, great and ample matter: and is of that ſort which Rhetoricians call <hi>Enthememati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cae,</hi> comprehending both parts of a breefe Argument, the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and Concluſion. As if S. Paule had ſayd: <hi>The Goſpell of Chriſt is the mightie power of God. Therefore I am not aſhamed of it.</hi> And theſe two partes of this ſhort Argument, I meane (with Gods aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taunce) at this time to ſpeake of. Firſt, how the Goſpell is the mightye power of God to ſaluation: and ſecondly, that for that cauſe we ſhould not be aſhamed of it, whatſoeuer carnall wiſedome would otherwiſe perſwade vs, either that the wickedneſſe of this world, or of the Diuill, would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice vs, and ſeduce vs.</p>
               <p>As touching the former parte: In what eſtimation the world had the Goſpell of Chriſt in S. <hi>Paule</hi> his time, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1. 23.</note> in the firſt to the <hi>Cor.</hi> doth very well declare, where he<note place="margin">Hovv con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Chriſt and his Goſpell vvere vnto the vvorld, in the begynning.</note> ſayth, that <hi>to the Iewes it was a great offence, and to the wiſe and learned <hi>Grecians,</hi> very folly and madneſſe.</hi> Both partes were offended, not only with the Doctrine, but with the baſe eſtate of Chriſtes owne perſon: who, as you know in countenance of the world was but meane and ſimple, <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> taken for his Father, being but a poore Carpenter, himſelfe, ſcantly hauing an houſe to put his head in, keping company with the contemned ſort of Publicans &amp; ſinners, In the ende, being put to moſte vile and reprocheful death. And therefore, euen in the time of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Chriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome:</hi>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:21473:4"/>
We reade, that if a gentleman, or noble perſon had<note place="margin">Vayne opinion of gentilitie may be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction of thoſe which regarde it.</note> bene turned to the Goſpel, his kin and aliance would come vnto him and ſay: What? <hi>Tu credis crucifixo?</hi> Art thou not aſhamed to hope for ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in him, that being put to extreme puniſhment was not able to ſaue himſelfe? And as they were then offended, in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> perſon of Chriſt, ſo in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine alſo, they thought it great folly, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> learned &amp; wiſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhould beleeue thoſe things, that by reaſon they were not able to conceiue: as, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> one perſon ſhould be both God and<note place="margin">Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge Chriſt which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mans carnal reaſon to contemne him.</note> man, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the ſonne of God ſhould die, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he being man, &amp; dead, ſhould riſe againe to life: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to attaine iuſtice before God, they muſt vtterly renou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce their own iuſtice &amp; good works, &amp; acknowledge themſelues to be moſt heinous ſinners: that they muſt abandon the world &amp; all the pleaſures thereof: y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they muſt for Chriſtes ſake, for go their wife, their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, their goods &amp; all that they had: finally y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they ſhould mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie their fleſhe, take their croſſe, &amp; by ignominie, reproche, &amp; perſecution follow Chriſt. This ſeemed to them not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſhame, and a folly, but an extreme madneſſe alſo. And therefore they had the profeſſors of the Goſpell in no eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, but accounted them fooles, and doating perſons.</p>
               <p>The greater &amp; more famous that the place &amp; citie was,<note place="margin">The more excellent men are in carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon only, the more they contemne Chriſte.</note> the greater &amp; more greeuous, was the contempt of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Goſpell in it. Wherefore vndoubtedly, this was no ſmall temptation in thoſe dayes, &amp; eſpecially in the Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> which then was Ladie and Empreſſe of the world, &amp; ſtoode much vpon their eſtimation of wiſedome &amp; honour, &amp; thought it reproche for them, to admit ſo baſe a ſtate of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as appeared to be in Chriſt Jeſu.

                  </note> this triall of their Doctrine, but ſeeke by all meanes they can, to auoide it. I wil not in this place diſcribe their whole practiſe herein, but I will note vnto you three poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.

Haue not many good men partly loſt their liuing, and borue fagots, partly bene burned, for no other cauſe? Manye yet aliue knowe it to bee true. But they did not only finde this meanes, to keepe it from the common people of GOD, but brought to paſſe, that it was almoſt out of vſe, euen with the learned ſorte: of which very fewe did reade the Texte
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21473:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of the Bible, you had almoſt tenne that wrotte vppon the mayſter of the ſentences. The greate heapes of ſchoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writers declare this to be true.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they doe marueilouſly diſgrace and diſcredit<note place="margin">The ſeconde poynte.</note> the Scriptures, as vnſufficient to ſaluation, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning all neceſſary truth, but that there are manye Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of neceſſity to be beleeued, whiche are not contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Scriptures. So ſayth <hi>Lindan. lib. 1. Cap. 10.</hi> The Apoſtles, ſayth hee, <hi>Woulde not committe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne principall pointes of our Fayth, to paper and ynke, thereby to perishe and be forgotten, but they committed them to the faythfull hartes of Chriſtians.</hi> As though thoſe thinges remayned more ſure, whiche be committed to the frayle memorye of ſeeble men in this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full world, then thoſe thinges, that by the ſpirite of God, are put in writing. Doe you not ſee howe this malicious<note place="margin">Matters of fayth maye better be preſerued by meanes of writing, then when they are only left to the bare memorie of man.</note> and reuolting Aduerſary, doth ouerthwart the gratious and ordinary prouidence of God, in preſeruing the truth of his doctrine and holy will? When God ſaw that the law written in the heart of man, was in continuaunce of time, by corruption of the world greatly blemiſhed, and almoſte cleare forgotten, then that it might bee renewed, and remayne more ſurelye in the memoryes of men, did hee not by <hi>Moyſes,</hi> put the ſame in writing? But this is the manner of the olde Heretiques, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſayeth,<note place="margin">The learned Aduerſarye refuſeth to be tried by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do manifeſtlye confound all ſuch.</note> 
                  <hi>When they are confuted by the Scriptures, they fall to blame and accuſe the ſcriptures, as though they were not in good caſe, and of ſufficient Authoritie, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they may be diuerſely interpreted: or as though the truth could not be knowne by them, without the knowledge of Traditions.

And therfore the Godly Fathers in the primatiue church, partly in the time of the Apoſtles, partlye after, reiected many counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feyted writinges, fathered by Heretiques, vppon ſome of the Apoſtles, becauſe they agreede not with the lawe, and the Prophets, nor were agreeable to the Analogie of fayth

that can be alleaged? Succeſſion, with continuance of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Doctrine, ought to be of great authoritie, but without it, nothing. It is notable that Tertullian hath in the Boke before alleaged: <hi>How commeth it,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that Heretikes are ſtraungers and ennimies to the Apoſtles, but only by the diuerſity of their Doctrine, which they<note place="margin">what Church is moſte likely to haue falle interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</note> deuiſe of their own brayn, agaynſt the Apoſtles.

The ſonnes of Aaron, had more allowable Succeſſion from <hi>Aaron,</hi> than the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> haue from <hi>Peter,</hi> and yet becauſe they brought ſtraunge Fyre into the Temple of God, they were reiected, and periſhed. Euen ſo, ſayth <hi>Cyprian. Thoſe which in the Churche of<note place="margin">De ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plic.

               <p>Though they pretend, to haue the ordinary Succeſſion of Biſhoppes in their Seas, ſure wee are, that wee haue the Succeſſion of the ſincere Doctrine of our ſaluation, which they haue not. For if their Doctrine be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared with the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, by the diuerſitye &amp; contrarietie thereof, it will appeare that it is the Doctrine, neyther of the Apoſtles, nor of anye Apoſtolicall men. The Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryne of the Apoſtles is, that Chriſte is not onelye GOD Eternall with the Father, but that hee is Manne alſo, taking fleſhe of the bleſſed Virgine, in all

But the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the Church of <hi>Roome</hi> telleth vs, that the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of Chriſt, and his very naturall body and blood, are really and carnally not in heauen alone, but in tenne thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande places alſo on the earth, at one inſtante, the whiche propertye is peculier to God alone. For nothing but God, can be in moe places but one, at once: As the whole ſcriptures declare.</p>
               <p>The Doctrine of the Apoſtles is, that Chriſt is by God<note place="margin">Rom. 3. 25. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Doctrine of the Apoſtles is, that Chriſt is our only<note place="margin">Act. 10. 43. Jer. 31. 34. Rom. 3. 25. Eph. 1. 7. Col. 1. 14.</note> Redeemer and ſauyoure, and by the price of his blood hath purchaſed for vs, full and perfite remiſſion of ſinne. But the Doctrine of <hi>Roome</hi> is, that we haue remiſſion of ſins not onely by Chriſte, but by the merites, and prayers of ſaynts, by our own good workes, by Maſſes, by Pardons, by Purgatory, by holy water, &amp; a number of other things: ſo that not without note of blaſphemye, they matche the vayne deuiſes of men, for the remiſſion of our ſinnes, with the Blood of the ſonne of God, the moſt excellente price of our Redemption. The Doctrine of the Apoſtles is, that Chriſt is our onely Prieſt for euer, according to the Order of <hi>Melchizadech,</hi> that with once offering of himſelfe, hath<note place="margin">Heb. .10. 1. 10</note> for euer made perfecte them, that bee ſanctified. But the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21473:23"/>
Church of <hi>Roome</hi> telleth vs, that Chriſte hath a ſtate of Prieſthoode ſucceeding him, which muſt dayly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, offer the very natural body and blood of Chriſte, to God the Father, for the remiſſion of the ſins of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> quick &amp; the dead. The Doctrine of the Apoſtles is, that Chriſte<note place="margin">Joh. 3. 2. Joh. 14. 26 Joh. 16. 13.</note> is the only Mayſter and teacher of his church, &amp; in his holy word, hath deliuered vnto it al truth: But the Church of <hi>Roome</hi> teacheth vs, that Chriſt hath not deliuered vnto vs all truth, but that there be many thinges, neceſſarye to be beleeued, which are not contained in the Scriptures, &amp; herevpon doe they ground al their vnwritten verities, and vayne tradicions of men, ſaying, that they are to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued with the like Reuerence, that the written worde<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11. 3. Eph. 5. 23.</note> of GOD is. The Doctrine of the Apoſtles is, that Chriſt is the onlye Heade of his Churche, and the Ruler and gouernor of the ſame: but the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> would perſwade vs, that the Pope &amp; his ſucceſſors, are the heads of the vniuerſall church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The doctrine of the Apoſtles is, that Chriſt is the only Foundacion &amp; ground of his Church, wherevpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it reſteth and is ſtayed: for S.

This may you ſee very euidently, how well the doctrine of the Church of <hi>Roome</hi> agreeth w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the doctrine of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtles. And therfore though they haue perſonall Succeſſion, neuer ſo muche: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue not Succeſſion of this true doctrine, that may not iuſtly, be taken for the right Churche of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now if they will continue to aſke of vs where oure Succeſſion is? We aunſwere, that whereſoeuer ſince the comming of Chriſt, there hath bene any perſons vpon the the face of the earth, that haue confeſſed this ſincere truth and doctrine: We ſay, that they are our predeceſſors, &amp; we
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:21473:24"/>
are their Succeſſors, and with them members of the true Church. Therefore our church is not ſo new a Church, as they would make it, but as auncient as the Doctrine is, which is the moſt auncient Doctrine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euer was vpon the face of the earth. But if this, their perſonal Succeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, be<note place="margin">Perſonall <hi>Succeſſion</hi> is no ſure profe for the Romiſhe church that it is the true church.</note> the greateſt proofe of their Church, What will they ſaye of the Grecians?

Yea, ſometime, they whiche<note place="margin">That may ſeame to be the true Churche whiche is not.</note> in the outwarde ſhewe of the Worlde, and by certayne externall Signes, mighte ſeeme to bee the Church, and haue taken vppon them, the name of the Churche, and people of GOD, haue bene perſecutors, and to theire power, the Oppreſſors of the true Churche of God, as it appeareth towarde the Prophets, towarde Chriſte himſelfe, and towarde his Apoſtles. Wherefore, though the heads and gouernors of the church, with the aſſiſtance of the greater number, doe forſake the true worde, &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of God, doe make new lawes, repugnante to gods word, do bring newe Rites &amp; ceremonies into the church, and vtterly corrupt and deface the righte Sacramentes, and true markes of the Churche: yet GOD reſerueth to himſelfe his true churche, ſending from tyme to tyme, Doctours, and Teachers, to lead them, although the ſame bee not allowed by them, that will bee counted the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary gouernoures of the churche, but eſteeme them as Sciſmatiks, as Heretiques, as diſturbers of the people of God. So were the Prophetes vſed, ſo was Chriſte him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and his Apoſtles ſerued by the Jewes, that woulde be counted the true churche of of GOD.

thought there had beene no moe but hym ſelfe? And yet God aunſwered, that he had left vnto him, euen in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a populous Church of. 7000. that neuer bowed their knee to the Image of Baal. This may be a full anſwere to them, that feare, if we ſhoulde not acknowledge the Churche of <hi>Rome</hi> to be the true Catholike Church, that Chriſt ſhould haue no Church at all. Yes vndoubtedly in the greateſt tyrannie, and corruption of the Churche of <hi>Rome,</hi> God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued to himſelfe, a great and populous Church, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of good people, that neuer were diſtained, with the wickedneſſe of that Sea, and ſought to worſhip God true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according to his holy worde, althoughe in ſome finall errours, they were caryed away, with the blindneſſe of the time. And this could I confirme by very Notable exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, yet remaining in hiſtories, if the time would ſerue.

Whreby you may<note place="margin">Outward holineſſe, no ſure to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of true teachers.</note> perceiue, that outward holyneſſe of life, is no ſure token of true teachers. For if falſe teachers might not vſe the ſame to winne the eſtimation of the people, Chriſt a little before woulde neuer haue blamed the Phariſies, for declaring their Faſting, theire Praying, theire Almes deedes, and other Righteouſneſſe beefore men, that they might<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 2.</note> be ſeene of them, and therefore he ſayth, they haue theire rewarde. But what ſhall we ſay? Becauſe falſe teachers and the wicked ſeruantes of Sathan doe vſe this outward ſhewe of holineſſe, and godlye excerciſes, to induce men to their corrupt Doctrine, ſhall the true Miniſters of Chriſt and preachers of his Goſpell caſt away the ſame? and ſhew in their life a diſſolute and looſe behauioure? God forbid.</p>
               <p>Sheepe you know, doe not hate their ſkinnes, nor will caſt them of, becauſe Wolues and Lyons ſometime are wrapped in the like: but they will for that cauſe bee more warye and take better heede, that by the ſhew and reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blaunce of their ſkinnes, they bee not deceaued, and offer themſelues to be deuoured of the Wolues, that be couered with them.</p>
               <p>Euen ſo the true Miniſters of Gods holy word, wil not therefore deteſte or caſte from them, honeſt conuerſation of life, and holy Chriſtian excerciſes, becauſe falſe Prophets abuſe the ſame to deceaue men, and leade them into errour,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:21473:38"/>
but rather, they will take the more heede themſelues, and call vpon other to doe the like, that they bee not miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caryed to anye falſe Doctrine, with the fayre counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce of their ſeuere and holy life. Although the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Gods word, and Preachers of his Goſpell, beeing the cheefe and principall ſheepe of his folde, ought alwaye to haue on them the right cloathing of honeſt and Godlye conuerſation: yet that is no certayne or ſure Token to prooue eyther the Doctrine to be good, or the Preachers to be true meſſengers of Chriſt, ſeeing that the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Teachers moſt commonly make greater ſhewe thereof in the face of the Worlde, then the true Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers do.

                  <note place="margin">Mat. 7. 15.</note> The firſt way to beware of them, is with earneſt and hartie Prayer to call vppon God, that by his gracious benefit,<note place="margin">1</note> and lyghtning of our heartes by his ſpirit, wee may know the falſe Prophetes, and by his prouidence he wil preſerue vs from them, and ſende out into his harueſt faithfull and true labourers, and that he will by his goodneſſe defende, ſtrengthen, and maintaine the ſame, againſt all aſſaultes, that they may to his glorie performe their worke, whereto he hath appoynted them.

Such as the ſpring and Fountayne is, ſuche is the Water of the Streame, Such as the roote is, ſuch is the Tree &amp; branches, Such as the maiſter is, ſuch are his Schollers, Suche as the head is, ſuch are the members.

               <p>The holyeſt of that ſorte, were men that were couered vnder the Lambe ſkinnes of Faſting, praying, and forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the world, and yet Vnder theſe Titles had they gotte them the riches of the world, and their liues were ſo notable, that in the common voyce of men, there was no ill tale, but a Freere, or a Religious manne, was at the one end of it.</p>

Oh, (dearely beloued) this is a greeuous and heauy accuſation, that whereas by Gods ſingular benefite, the doctrine of repentance, remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes, and newneſſe of life is taught among vs, more diſtinctly, more truely and ſincerely, than euer it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet that godlyneſſe of lyfe, and honeſt conuerſation ſhould not followe.

We ought therefore (deerely beloued,) with hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hartes to giue immortall thankes to the eternall God, in our Sauiour Chriſt Jeſus, that he hath vouchedſafe ſo graciouſly, and ſo mercifully, to haue conſideration of our infirmitie, to helpe our frailtie, and as it were to leade vs like children by the hand, and appoint vs whether to goe, and what to doe: and to giue vs thoſe exerciſes to trade vs to the obedience of his will, and confeſſion of his name, to marke vs with his badges and cognizances, that wee may be knowen to be his, to faſten vs together with theſe linkes of vnitie and Chriſtian concorde, and finally to prepare for vs ſuch and ſo bleſſed inſtrumentes, to bring vnto vs hys heauenly bleſſings.

                  <note place="margin">Gen. 15. 9.</note> willed a Bullocke, a Goate, and a Weather to bee kylled, and the Lorde in forme of a burning lyght paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them, by that ſolemnitie aſſuring him, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he had promyſed, ſhould in truth be performed. The outwarde Circumciſion, the Paſchall Lambe, and all the multitude of Sacrifices of the olde lawe, were nothing but ſeales to confirme the trueth of Gods promiſe of ſaluation, in the true ſacrifice that ſhoulde come. Euen ſo dealeth Chriſt with vs in his Sacramentes, Thoſe he hath orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as his deedes, and inſtrumentes, as before I haue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, to aſſure vs of his promyſes. And ſo much are his deedes more ſure, and his promyſes more certaine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, than any mans can bee: as his wyll is more iuſt, to ſtande to that he hath ſayde, and his habilitie to performe it greater.</p>

The old Iewes vndes the lawe had the ſame hope of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation by Chriſt, that we now haue.</note> to note, what difference is betweene theyr Churche and ours, and their ſacramentes and ours. And principally I do this, becauſe many through ignoraunce are of that opinion, that the ſaluation of mankinde by Chriſt was neuer hearde of in the worlde, before Chriſt came in fleſhe, and that the Iewes had ſome other meane of ſaluation than by him, and therefore that their ſacramentes and ours are nothing like. But this errour taketh away from all Chriſtians a paſſing great comforte, that is, that Chriſtian Religion, and that Meanes of ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, is no new thing, but hath continued e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſince the beginning of the world, according as it is ſaid

               <p>Firſt therefore you muſt vnderſtande, and the whole courſe of the Scriptures teacheth vs, that there is but one eternall and immutable GOD of both thoſe Churches, I meane of the Iewes before Chriſt, and of chriſtians nowe, whome they both, dyd worſhyppe in ſpirite and in trueth.

But this deteſtable hereſie hath beene iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned, and caſt out of the Churche manye hundred yeeres ſince. Secondlye, both thoſe Churches haue but one manner of ſaluation propoſed to them in the promyſes of GOD, that is, by the death of Chriſt, the <hi>Meſsias</hi> and ſonne of God.

What can bee more euident than the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Paſſouer?

Therefore it is not to bee doubted, that in their ſacrifices and ſacramentes they ſawe the true <hi>Meſsias</hi> and Sauiour, and vnderſtoode that thoſe things were but Sermons and Preachings to direct them to the beliefe thereof.

               <p>And yet you maye not thinke that the Soule dyeth, after that ſorte that the bodye doeth, by ceaſſyng to haue a beeing, or a continuaunce, but it dreth a ſpirituall death by ſeparation of God from it, ſo that the tyme that it is, and hath a beeing withoute God, is nothing but a moſte horrible tormente, and more greeuous then a thouſande bodilye deathes.

to preferre vs to eternall lyfe. But this meate, muſt be yet further prepared, or elſe it woulde not ſerue our turne in feeding of vs. Chriſt therefore was prepared and made apte meat for vs to eate, vpon the Aulter of the Croſſe, where his body was broken, and his blood ſhedde, and he offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to God the father, a ful &amp; perfect ſacrifice for our ſinne, and afterward raiſed the ſame his body from death to life, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> it might be very true ſuſtenaunce to euerlaſting life, aptly, and truely in all reſpectes prepared to that end.</p>

This queſtion hath vexed all Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, nowe for the ſpace of certaine yeres, &amp; hath exerciſed the pennes and tongues almoſt of all learned men of this age, with great vehemencie on eche ſide. But ſurely if they would with ſingle mindes, without heat of contention true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider, howe the fruite and benefite of this heauenly foode is receaued, this controuerſie might bee eaſily ended, and many a troubled conſcience quieted, which now almoſt only are by this meanes ſtayed, from embracing the trueth of the Goſpell. They doe not ſo greatly miſlike the other parts of our doctrine, but this ſticketh in their conſciences, that wee denie the body and blood of Chriſt, really and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally eaten and drunken in the Sacrament. Wherefore I hartely deſire al ſuch, for the time to laye aſide that ſettled perſwaſion, wherewith their mindes hitherto hath beene ſo holden, that they could not abide to heare any thing of the contrarie, and with indifferent and charitable mindes care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to conſider, that which in parte I haue, and now here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhall ſpeake touchyng this matter. Firſt, therefore<note place="margin">Againſt the carnal eating &amp; drinking of Chriſts body and blood.</note> you muſt call to your remembraunce, that Chriſtes bodye, is not carnall meate and drinke for our bodyes, but ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meat and drinke for our ſoules, and for that cauſe <hi>S. Paul</hi> in this place ſo calleth it, ſaying, <hi>That the olde Fathers</hi>

                  <hi>did eate of the ſame ſpirituall meate, and drinke of the ſame ſpiritual drinke.</hi> And yet I muſt needes confeſſe that this ſpirituall meate is profitable, not to the ſoule onely, but to the body alſo. For Chriſt dyed for preſeruation both of ſoule and bodye. But this benefite of nouriſhment, is not firſt receaued of the bodye, and throughe it paſſeth to the ſoule, for that were monſtrous, but beeyng firſt recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the ſoule, it profiteth the bodye. For as Chriſt ſayth, <hi>That which entreth into the bodily mouth defy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth<note place="margin">Mat. 15. 11</note> not the man, but that commeth out of the mouth from the corrupte hearte and mynde.</hi> So contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyſe not that good thing, that entreth by the bodye dothe profyte the ſoule, but that which entered firſt by the ſoule, and is receaued by it, profyteth alſo the bodye. For the body and bloud of Chriſt, beeyng in deede the true foode of lyfe, when it is ſpiritually eaten by the ſoule, through the operation of the holye Ghoſt, maketh vs apte to Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and in due tyme tranſformeth our mortall bodyes, to the lykeneſſe of his glorious bodye. <hi>If the ſpirite of<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 11.</note> him that raiſed Chriſt from death dwell in vs, he that raiſed Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall bodies, becauſe that his ſpirit, through Chriſt, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in vs.</hi> The better to vnderſtand what it is to eate this ſpirituall foode, and how it is truely &amp; effectually receaued to eternall lyfe: I muſt put you in minde of the compariſon that before I vſed betweene the body and the ſoule. As the bodye is ſayde to eate when it receaueth that ſuſtenaunce, wherewith the hunger thereof is ſtayed and ſatiſfied, and as it is ſayde to drinke, when it receaueth that liquour, wherewith the thirſt is quenched: euen ſo our ſoule is ſayde to eate and to drinke, when it receaueth that heauenly and bleſſed foode of Chriſt Jeſus crncifyed, wherewith the hungry, and thirſtie appetite thereof, that is, the vehement deſire of the fauour of God and ſaluation, is fully ſatiſfyed, and appeaſed.</p>
               <p>As there commeth no benefit to the body, of meat &amp; drinke,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:21473:75"/>
vnleſſe it bee eaten and drunken: ſo the bodye and blood of Chriſt crucified, doth not helpe vs anye thing, if it bee not worthily and truely receaued. The body receaueth hys foode, by the mouth of the body, the ſoule receaueth hirs, by the mouth of the ſoule. As it is not ſufficient to hunger and thirſt, nor to receaue ſuſtenaunce, vnleſſe there be a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſtrength in our bodyes to receaue, concoct, and digeſt the ſame: ſo there muſt be in our ſoules that ſtrength, that may ſurely receaue Chriſt, and wrappe him or embrace him in the bowels of our heart, that he may thereby, as it were, be turned into vs, and wee into him, but that ſtrength is not in our ſelues, but is giuen of God. We muſt therefore haue it from him, from whom all good giftes proceede, that is, <hi>From the father of lyghtes.</hi> And this gift wherewith<note place="margin">Iac. 1. 17.</note> Chriſt is truely and effectually receaued, is nothing but faith. For by fayth we receaue Chriſt, and aſſure our ſelues in our hartes, that wee are partakers of that redemption, which by his death he hath procured for vs, and with that firme perſwaſion, lay him vp in the bowels of our heartes, that in all our temptations and troubles, we may feede vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and gather ſtrength and comfort, in the aſſuraunee of Gods fauour purchazed by him: ſo that ſo often as our heartes bee ſhaken with miſtruſt and feare, this faith doth comforte and releeue vs agayne.

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:21473:75"/>
(deerely beloued) what Chriſt ſayth, <hi>He that commeth to me ſhall not hunger,</hi> therfore to come vnto Chriſt, is to eat Chriſt. And againe he ſaith: <hi>He that beleeueth in mee, ſhall neuer thirſt,</hi> therfore to beleeue in Chriſt, is to drinke Chriſt. To eat and to drinke are meanes to take away hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and thirſt, but to come vnto Chriſt, &amp; to beleeue in him, as Chriſt himſelfe ſaith, doth take away hunger and thirſt: therefore to come vnto him, and to beleeue in him, is to eate him, and to drinke him. An other out of the ſame place is this, Chriſt attributeth the ſame effectes and fruits to them which beleeue in him, that he doth to them that eate his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and drinke his blood: therefore by eating and drinking, he meaneth nothing but beleeuing. His wordes bee theſe <hi>Iohn. 6.</hi> verſe. 54. <hi>He that eateth my fleſhe and drinketh my blood hath eternall life, and I will raiſe him vp at the laſt daye.</hi> Note the effectes that he gyueth to eatyng his fleſhe and drinking his blood, that is, <hi>to haue euerlaſting lyfe, and bee rayſed at the laſt daye.</hi> In the. 40. verſe of the ſame Chapter hee ſayeth: <hi>This is the wyll of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſent mee, that euerie one that ſeeth the ſonne, and beleeueth on him, ſhould haue eternall life, &amp; I will raiſe him vp at the laſt daye.</hi> Who ſeeth not heere that Chriſt attributeth the ſame force to beleeuing, that in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther verſe he did to eating and drinking, and therfore vſeth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wordes indifferently, as beyng of one meaning. I myght ſtay vpon many other places, wherein the holy Ghoſt wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſeth that we haue eternall life by beleeuing in Chriſt, as in the ſame place, <hi>He that truſteth in me hath eternal life,</hi>

Chriſt in the words before recited, extendeth the carefull prouidence of God to Sparrowes, and to the heares of oure heades, to the end no man ſhould thinke or imagine, that it is onelye a generall prouidence, as many doe in theſe days, which as they dare not deny, that the world is gouerned by the wiſedome and power of God, ſo they thinke it an abſurde thing to teach, that God is occupied about all particular Creatures, and ſpecially them that be of the meaneſt ſort. Therefore they expound choſe wordes that Chriſte vſeth here, or the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in other places, to be ſpoken by <hi>Hiperbole,</hi> that is, a manner of fyguratiue ſpeeche, paſſing all truth, thereby to ſignifie a meane truth. But I would learne of theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, what it is, that ſauing the nature of his Godhead, maye in this kind of thing be ſpoken of him more then truth, ſeeing he is Omnipotent, of infinite knowledge, and is preſent in al places. So much as they ſhal exempt from Gods diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his Creatures, ſo much ſhall they with diſhonour of God, pul from his Almightie power and infinit wiſdome. We may not think it is any diſgracing of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> maieſly of god, to drawe the ſame his prouydence to the preſeruation and direction euen of his meaneſt creatures. For he worketh not as men do with labour and greefe, or torment of mind. His very beck, will, and countenaunce is ynough to doe, or alter all thinges, euen to ſhake Heauen and earth, as the blinde Heathen Poet <hi>Homere</hi> could ſaye. Yea this is the greateſt profe that can be of his exceeding maieftie, that he
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:21473:86"/>
ſeeth all thinges, that he diſpofeth and worketh al things, that he directeth all his Creatures to that ende, for which in the beginning he made them. If this be ſo, ſome wil ſay vnto mee, why then, as God is to be prayſed and thanked, for all that is good, ſo whatſoeuer is euill alſo, is to bee imputed vnto him, and no man or other creature, no nor the Deuil himſelfe to be blamed for any hurt that is done, becauſe it is Gods will and diſpoſition it ſhoulde bee, and agaynſt that, who is able to ſtande? And ſo GOD ſhall<note place="margin">God is not the author of ſinne.</note> be accounted the Authoure of ſinne, whiche is a wicked, and horrible aſſertion. Theſe daungerous cogitations are by Sathan thruſt into the mindes of Chriſtians, purpoſely to make them to murmure againſt God and his prouide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. And as I am very loth in this Auditory, to enter into the ſearche of Gods ſecrete Judgementes, ſo may I not cleane omit to take away the offence of this vngodlye cogitation. And yet meane I not to doe that deepelye, and with intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and harde reaſons, but ſuch, as the meaneſt perſon not voyde of naturall vnderſtanding, may ſufficientlye con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ceaue. Who knoweth not that the end wherevnto anye<note place="margin">Euerie act is to be meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red good or bad, by the intent of the actor.</note> thing is done, maketh one and the ſame thing eyther good or badde, iuſt or vnuiſte? A Magiſtrate putteth a man to death, not for hatred of the perſon, not for particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueugement, nor to haue benefite by his goods, and in this he doth well, being the Miniſter of God, by him appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo to die. A Ruffyan or a Theefe, killeth a man to be reuenged on him, to haue his goods, or to th'end he may auoyde ſome daunger thereby, and in this he ſinneth gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly. And yet to kill a man, or to put him to death is all one act, iuſt and good in the one, wicked and naughty in the other. So GOD by his prouidence, maye diſpoſe thoſe thinges to bee done which wicked perſons, as his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes doe perfourme, &amp; the ſame iuſt in God, in them ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and naught.

               <p>God had often times by his Prophets, called his people the Jewes to leaue their Superſtition and Idolatrie, to leaue their wickedneſſe and naughtie life, and to returne to him by repentaunce, and yet they would not: <hi>I roſe vp<note place="margin">Jer. 7. 13.</note> earely,</hi> ſayth God by the mouth of <hi>Ieremy) and ſent vnto you all my Prophets, and you haue not heard me, nor haue not in cliued your eare vnto mee, but haue done worſe then your forefathers. &amp;c.</hi> Therefore he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued according to their deſeruing iuſtely to puniſh them.

And who can denie but that this doonig was in the King ſtafull and naughte, and therefore was this enill mind in him, not long after puniſhed by GOD himſelfe. And this maketh verye greatlye to the ſetting foorth of Gods wiſedome, that hee canne vſe naughtie In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentes,<note place="margin">God vſeth naughtie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to the working of good.</note> to puniſhe naughtye men, and turne the minds and indeuoures of wicked perſons to his glorye, and to the ſatiſfying of his iuſtice, though they in no parte regard the ſame.

The Jewes in defence of their Synagogue, denie Chriſt to bee the light of the world, that ſhoulde open the true way of ſaluation to men, but affirme, that he was an a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

On the other part, Chriſt in deede mooued wyth the true zeale of Gods houſe, after hee had declared, that hee was the lyght of the worlde, which, hee that followed, ſhould not walke in darkeneſſe, but ſee the truth of euerla<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſting life, he euidently proueth, that the Jewes were not, as they pretended to bee, the right ſeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> for<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

then they would doe the workes of <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, for then, they would haue receaued him, who was ſent vnto them from God, but earneſtly affirmeth, that they are of the ſeede, and ofſpring of Sathan, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of lying, and vntrothe, and therefore euen by very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of nature, they could not abyde the truth.

ſelfe and as many profeſſoures of the Goſpell as I know, that whatſoeuer Doctrine is agreeable to this, wee doe gladly receiue it, and with both armes imbrace it, though it come from the Churche of <hi>Roome.</hi> And whatſoeuer Doctrine is repugnant to this, and will not ſtande with it, wee doe reiecte it, though it come from an Aungell in Heauen.

            </p>
            <p>Now as touching the ſecond branche, what it is to<note place="margin">What it is to deny chriſt to haue come in fleſhe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that in two. ſortes.</note> denye Chriſte to haue come in Fleſhe, and who they are that denye it, you ſhall vnderſtande that there bee two wayes to denye Chriſte to haue come in fleſhe. The one flatlye and groſelye, and in playne wordes, as <hi>Ebion, Erinthus, Marcion, Valentinian, Arrius,</hi> and a number ſuche other, in the Primatiue Churche, whiche denyed eyther the Deitie, or Humanitie of Chriſte. But in them Sathan ſhewed himſelfe in his owne Coloures, like a blacke Deuill, and therefore the Hereſyes beeing ſo groſſe, were ſoone confuted, and confounded in the Churche of GOD. There is another waye more ſubtle, and perilous, vndirectly to denye Chriſt to haue come in fleſhe, in whiche Sathan tourneth himſelfe into an Aungell of lighte, and as <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſayeth, <hi>Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Chriſte, confounding the Religion of chriſte.</hi> That is, While in wordes they confeſſe the Incarnation of Chriſt, by peruerſe Doctrynes in effecte they deny it, by denying thoſe cauſes, for which the Sonne of GOD was Incarnate, attributing the effect of oure Saluation, to other thinges. And after this<note place="margin">Popiſtes and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants do deny Chriſt to haue come in the fleſh and how.</note> ſorte, the Teachers of the Churche of <hi>Roome,</hi> very plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye and perilouſlye denye Chriſte to haue come in fleſhe, as I wil particularly lette you vnderſtande by the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of our ſaluation before recyted. As touching the fyrſt cauſe of Chriſte his Incarnation, that Chriſte is the onelye

            <p>Secondly in this praying to the Saintes, not without great daunger of Idolatrie, they attribute vnto them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine power. For in their praying to them, they imagine of them, that they bee of <hi>Vniuerſall knowledge,</hi> and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, not onelye what men ſpeake, but alſo what they thinke in theire hartes. Agayne they attribute vnto them <hi>Almightie power,</hi> as being able to worke and bring to paſſe whatſoeuer is deſyred of them. And laſtlye, they ſhewe themſelues to beleeue, that they are <hi>More merciful, and readye to heare ſinners, then Chriſt himſelf,</hi> which is flat Blaſphemy. As touching the ſecond cauſe of chriſt his Incarnation, that he is our onlye redeemer and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chazer of remiſſion of our ſinnes: This ground of our faith they weaken, by a number of corrupt Doctrines.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:21473:121"/>As firſt, that in parte wee haue ſaluation and remiſſion of ſinnes, by the Merites of Saintes, for thus they praye:</p>

the third cauſe of Chriſtes Incarnatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that he being our only high Prieſt according to the order of <hi>Melchizo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech,</hi> hath once for euer offered himſelf vpon the Croſſe, &amp; purchaſed for vs eternall rede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ption, they impugne it wyth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> moſt horrible doctrine of the propiciatorie ſacrifice, daily offered in the Maſſe, wherin they teach, that mortall &amp; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men in a ſtate of Prieſthood ſucceede Chriſt, &amp; continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally offer the very reall &amp; naturall body of Chriſt to God the father, for the remiſſion of dayly ſinnes, not only of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate, but of them that looke on, &amp; receaue not, yea, and of them that be abſent, and procure the ſame to be made eyther for money or otherwiſe, aſwell for themſelues as other, which is directly contrarie to the doctrine of the holy Ghoſt, in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrewes.</hi> Where at large he prooueth, that neither the Prieſthood of Chriſt can haue any ſucceſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nor his ſacrifice any repetitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out euident note of imperfection.</p>
            <p>As concerning the fourth cauſe of Chriſtes Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he is the only Maiſter and teacher of his Church, and hath reuealed vnto vs the perfecte wyll of God, and true waye of Saluation, ſo that nowe after hym, wee ſhoulde receaue no doctrine, but that is vttered by the voyce of our hygh Sheeparde in his holye worde. Yes, ſayeth the Churche of <hi>Rome,</hi> there bee many weyghtie matters, of neceſſitie of ſaluation to bee beleeued, which Chriſt in hys written worde hath not deliuered vnto vs, and the ſame to bee receaued wyth lyke reuerence, that the written worde of God is.</p>
            <p>Laſt of all, the fifte cauſe of Chriſtes Incarnation, that he came to be the onely Head, Ruler, Gouernour, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectour of his Churche, the Patrones of the Churche of <hi>Rome</hi> manifeſtly denye, ſaying: that Chriſt is in deede the onely heade for ſaluation, but not for gouernment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Pope is the Miniſteriall heade and gouernour, and directour of the vniuerſall Churche, wherein they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:21473:122"/>
alter the nature of Chriſtes kingdome. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the kingdome of Chriſt is not of this worlde, but a ſpirituall kingdome, wherein by the word of God, and the power of his holy ſpirite, hee ruleth and raygneth in the heartes of true Chriſtians, the Pope hath tranſferred it to an earthly kingdome and Empyre, by which, as the Vicar of Chriſt he challengeth a vniuerſall gouernment, not onely ouer the Eccleſiaſticall ſtate, but alſo ouer all Princes and gouernours of the earth. This oppoſition and contrarietie of the doctrines of the Churche of <hi>Rome,</hi> to the doctrine of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Goſpell, if you diligently marke and obſerue, you ſhall euidently ſee in them the ſpirite of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, althoughe not groſſely and playnely, yet vndi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and colourablye denying Chriſt, to haue come in fleſhe. What ſhall I ſaye, that the doctrine of that Churche dothe not onely diſgrace the office of Chryſt, in the worke of our redemption, but hys perſon alſo, by brynging hys humanitie and the trueth of hys bodye in doubte, whyle they teache, that the verye naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Chriſt is really in all places, or in tenne thouſand places at once, that is, in euerye hoſt conſecrated through out the whole worlde? And what Chriſtian knoweth not, that it is the propertie of of God alone, and of no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, bee it neuer ſo holye, to bee in manye places at once? Finallye I adde, that the Churche of <hi>Rome</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth corruptlye, as touching Originall Sinne, freewill, and the grace of GOD, Faith and Juſtification, good workes and the merites of them, the vſe of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, and almoſt of all doctrines touching Chriſtian Religion. Therefore, I truſt you nowe perceyue both the partes of my ſecond propoſition euidently proued, that is, that we ſincerely confeſſe and teache in all true ſenſe, that Chriſt is come in fleſhe, and they doe not, therefore accordyng to the wordes of my Theame, I ſay vnto you, <hi>If we teach you the truth, why doe you not beleeue vs?</hi>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:21473:123"/>
If it be the onely right way of ſaluation, why is it not fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourably receaued and embraced? If it be the glad tidings of the Goſpell ſent by God vnto you, why are the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers thereof diſdayned and contemned? People that doe feare God, heare the worde of God with reuerence, and not onely heare it with the eares, but faithfully beleeue it in the hart, and not onely beleeue it, but conſtantly abyde in it, &amp; not onely themſelues to abyde in it, but by all meanes they can to labour to drawe other to it, and to repreſſe all ſuch as eyther reuolte from it themſelues, or ſeeke to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace or diſcredite it in others. God is not more diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with any thing, than with the contempt of his word and Miniſters. Thus ſayth the Lord by <hi>Ieremie</hi> in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 6. chap. reprouing the obſtinacie of his people, <hi>Stand in the wayes<note place="margin">Jer. 6. 16.</note> and behold, &amp; aske for the olde way, which is the good way, and walke therin, and there you ſhall finde reſt for your ſoules, but they ſaid, we wil not walk therin.</hi> Alſo, <hi>I ſet watchmen ouer you, which ſaid take heede to the ſounde of the Trumpet, but they ſaid, we will not take heede.</hi> But conſider what God addeth immediatly, <hi>Heare O earth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>beholde I will cauſe a plague to come<note place="margin">Verſe. 19.</note> vpon this people, euen the fruite of their owne imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe they haue not taken heede vnto my wordes, nor vnto my law, but haue caſt it of.</hi> And in the laſt Chap. of the. 7. of the Chronicles, it is thus written, <hi>The Lord God of their fathers hath ſent vnto them by<note place="margin">2. Chro. 36. 15.</note> his Meſſengers, riſing vp earely, and ſending, for he had compaſsion on his people, and of his habitation, but they mocked the Meſſengers of God, and miſuſed his Prophetes, vntill the wrath of the Lord roſe againſt his people, and till there was no remedie, for he brought vpon them the King of the Chaldees, who ſlewe their yong men with the ſworde. &amp;c.</hi> God of his great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, hath ſundry times ſent into this land, his Meſſengers and Preachers of his Goſpell, and principally theſe twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeeres laſt paſt, in which time, the ſounde of Gods holy
<pb facs="tcp:21473:123"/>
worde hath continually roong in the eares of men, yet was the loue of the Goſpell neuer ſo colde, as euen at this day, nor the hartes of Engliſh men, ſo ready to reuolt from it. It is lamentable to vnderſtande howe in all partes of the Realme, thoſe Papiſtes, whiche before time appeared to be ſomewhat afrayde, and ſought by all meanes to hyde themſelues, doe now openly ſhew themſelues, and deſire to be knowne to be as they are. What their hope or expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is, the Lord knoweth, but ſurely it is full time, that hir Maieſtie, and hir moſt Honourable Counſell, as they feare God, and loue his truth, doe ſpeedily looke vnto it, otherwiſe vndoubtedly, the inconuenience will be greater, than by authoritie will be eaſily ſtayde. The care hereof, I leaue to them, whome God hath ſette in place of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, only I thought it my duetye, being appoynted a watchman in the Church of God, to ſounde the Trumpet in this place, and to giue warning, that the bloud of them that periſh, be not required at my hande, and withall, moſte humbly and hartilye praye vnto almighty God, that with the grace of his holy ſpirite, he will ſo direct &amp; ſtrengthen the minds of them, whoſe principall charge this is, that that may be done, which moſte tendeth to the glory of God, and maintenance of his truth, and to the good ſtate and preſeruation of this our naturall Countrey.</p>
