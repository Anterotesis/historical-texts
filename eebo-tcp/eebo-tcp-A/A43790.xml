            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>HAVING Diſcourſed in a former <hi>Diſſertation, Of the Antiquity of Temples in the times of the Old Teſtament:</hi> I proceed in this, with the Conſideration, <hi>Of the Antiquity of Churches in Goſpel times under the New.</hi> Wherein the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Opinion of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> is maintained, not only againſt <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> but ſome <hi>Proteſtants</hi> alſo, as <hi>Fuller</hi> in his <hi>Miſcellanea Sac. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 9. who undertakes to prove that Chriſtians had their Churches or Temples built, even in the days of the Apoſtles: And more eſpecially <hi>Mede,</hi> who hath largely handled this Subject in's Treatiſe <hi>Of Appropriate Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for Chriſtian Worſhip, both in, and ever ſince the Apoſtles time.</hi> Both theſe ſtate and maintain the Queſtion as they do, and light their Candles at their Torches.

                  </gap>(which we render, when taken for a Religious Aſſembly, by the word <hi>Church;</hi> from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, whence the Saxon <hi>Cyric,</hi> and the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man <hi>Kyrk,</hi> and we by adding a double Aſpiration <hi>Chyrch,</hi> or <hi>Church</hi>) as it was in after Ages (not in the beginning) taken for a Publick Place for Worſhip. Concerning which, here let me premiſe, That although we have no particular command for building of Churches, as of Old for the Tabernacle (which was a moveable Temple) or the Temples, which were ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tabernacles, (their Names being frequently interchanged;) nor do they recommend our Services to God, as thoſe that were Typical of our Saviour did: Yet are Edifices very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for the Worſhippers, and are ſo far neceſſary for the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62137:4"/>advancing Gods Service, as appears by the Light of Nature, and the uſe of Synagogues amongſt the <hi>Jews:</hi> That by ſuch Structures we are better defended againſt the injuries of Wind and Weather; as alſo, the Voice of the Miniſter is in them more Audible than in the open Air, and that thereby we have greater conveniency of excluding ſuch, as ought not to Communicate with us: Beſides that after the ſpreading of the Goſpel, they were more neceſſary for the containing a greater number of Chriſtians, than could meet together in private Houſes, or Places: which occaſioned afterwards, as liberty was granted, or encouragement given by Chriſtian Magiſtrates, the building of Oratories and Churches. So that tho we grant the Primitive Chriſtians had always Places for Publick Worſhip; yet we deny they built any Edifices publickly for the exerciſe of their Religion, or had any ſuch appropriate places, as our Opponents call <hi>Temples</hi> or <hi>Churches;</hi> but worſhipp'd God in ſuch numbers, as could conveniently meet together, only in private Houſes, or ſuch places as were obſcure, for above 200 Years after our Bleſſed Saviour's A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion. Altho in the Third Century, they had ſome Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories or Conventicles, here and there, even in the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, as well as in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and other Nations, where the Goſpel was ſpread.

               <p>The Reaſons for this our Aſſertion are, (1.) The great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions the Chriſtians lived under for the moſt part, all that time. Which is ſo apparent from all Hiſtories, Sacred and Civil, that I wonder <hi>Fuller</hi> ſhould ſay, <hi>That Perſecutions in the beginning were more rare, and for the moſt part private.</hi> Both which are notoriouſly falſe, as appears from the <hi>Acts.</hi> For no ſooner had the Apoſtles begun to preach the Goſpel, <hi>c.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. but they were by the Rulers impriſoned, beaten
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62137:4"/>and charged to deſiſt, <hi>c.</hi> 4 <hi>&amp;</hi> 5. <hi>Stephen</hi> taken and ſtoned, <hi>c.</hi> 6 <hi>&amp;</hi> 7.

A Tumult againſt <hi>Paul, &amp;c. c.</hi> 19. He ſaith, bonds and afflictions wait for him in every City, and that grievous Wolves ſhould enter among them, not ſparing the Flock, <hi>c.</hi> 20. And what Perſecutions he ſuffered at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> not only from the Rabble, but the Chief, both of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> may be ſeen in the following Chapters. Moſt of his Epiſtles were written in Bonds. And its gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſaid, that he ſuffered at <hi>Rome</hi> under <hi>Nero,</hi> as <hi>Peter,</hi> many ſay, did alſo. And St. <hi>John</hi>'s Baniſhment into the Iſle of <hi>Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos,</hi> is certain (as 'tis ſaid) by the Emperour <hi>Domitian.</hi> And <hi>Hoſpinian</hi> hath obſerved, that from the Apoſtles time, till Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Sylveſter</hi> and the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s, for above 300 Years, not one of all thoſe 30 Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi> but ſuffer'd Martyrdom. But <hi>Fuller</hi> adds, that the ſame publick calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were uſually common to the <hi>Jews</hi> with the Chriſtians; and therefore if they kept their Synagogues, why might not theſe their Churches. <hi>Mede</hi> alſo urgeth this of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues, becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> Religion was no more the Empires than the Chriſtians. Both which we deny, for the Jews were the Perſecutors, and the Chriſtians the Perſecuted: they uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſtirring up and incenſing the <hi>Gentiles</hi> againſt theſe, as the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles</hi> teſtifie, and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.14, 15, 16. Nor had the Chriſtians then any Churches, as the Jews had Synagogues, tho they had in ſome Cities ſeparate Meetings. Of the Jewiſh Synagogues we read in Scripture, but neither Scripture nor Hiſtory mentions any publick Churches for 200 Years. And afterwards, when they had ſome Oratories, we read of courſes taken for demoliſhing them: but not (much leſs at the ſame time) of the Jewiſh Synagogues. Theſe hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been long before, publickly tollerated in many Places to the Jews where they reſided. And they having now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Chriſt, the Devil and Heathen Emperours had no cauſe to diſquiet them, but made uſe of them in oppoſing
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62137:5"/>Chriſtianity. As <hi>Julian</hi> we know, employ'd them for build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again their Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to deſpite the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. And no Religion is more hated of a Natural Man than the True; all others being prefer'd before this.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> in anſwering the Objections againſt his Opinion, endeavours to enervate this of Perſecution two ways. (1.) By aſſerting, that the greateſt Perſecutions (as the five laſt of the Ten) fell out in the Third Century, wherein 'tis granted the Chriſtians had ſome Oratories, and therefore why not in the two former, ſeeing their Perſecutions were not continual, nor of long duration. But tho we grant, in regard of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Bloud-ſhed, the laſt were the cruelleſt; yet was there always ſuch as hindred, both the erecting and appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating Churches, and publickly aſſembling (the Laws and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors being their Enemies) contenting themſelves to meet as they could with the moſt ſafety in ſecret. And tho their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution was not conſtant, yet were they conſtantly liable thereunto, as the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.36. <hi>For thy ſake we are killed all the day long, we are accounted as Sheep for the Slaughter.</hi> Hiſtories alſo ſhew us, their Sufferings were more continual, and leſs interrupted, in the two firſt, than third Century. Wherein after a ſore Storm under <hi>Valerian,</hi> they enjoy'd a comfortable calm, under his Son <hi>Galienus,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to them their Cemeteries, and all other places of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; which was ſuch a favour or Tolleration, as we read not of in the two firſt Ages. (2.) Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> argues from the credibility of the Chriſtians having Oratories in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, as well as in the <hi>Perſian.</hi> Which we deny, for 'tis the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire only, that is repreſented under the Shape of a Red Dragon with 7 Heads and 10 Horns, making War with the Saints of God. Nor are we now dealing with a matter of Opinion, or Credibility, but matter of Fact and Hiſtory; which aſcertains the Perſecution under the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors for 300 years, but mentions little or none at all, under the <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarchs, during that time, tho afterwards, as <hi>Sozomen l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 8. relates by <hi>Saporez,</hi> which was long before <hi>Iſdigerdis,</hi> who was Contemporary with <hi>Theodoſius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor doth the Churches of <hi>Perſia</hi> prejudice our Opinion; ſeeing they were but (by Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s acknowledgment) in <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time. Before which, there were ſome Churches in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. For <hi>Diocleſian</hi> his Predeceſſor made an Edict for the demoliſhing them.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62137:5"/>
               <p>Having thus vindicated our Argument from ſeveral At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks: We may further enforce it, both by the experience of former Ages, and alſo our own. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> tho they dwelt together, a long time at leaſt, yet we read not of any Temples they built there. And when they were in Captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> tho we read of their building Houſes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 29. yet nothing of Synagogues. Paſs on from the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh to the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Perſecutions, former and latter: Where at this day, in <hi>Italy, France, Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> are any Churches built, or Publick Meeting-Places for <hi>Proteſtants?</hi> Nay even the <hi>Lutherans</hi> will not allow the publick exerciſe of the Reformed Religion. The Story of the <hi>German</hi> Church under <hi>Johannes a Laſco,</hi> who fled from <hi>London,</hi> to avoid the Perſecution under Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> to the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and how barbarouſly treated, is well known, and lamentable to conſider. And the ſame ſpirit continues, ſo that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Church at <hi>Hamburg</hi> go to <hi>Altena,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are confin'd to their own Houſe. <hi>Sweden</hi> is expelling them, and ſeveral Princes perſecuting them. Nor need we go ſo far, the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of theſe Three Kingdoms is ſufficient. Where altho the Perſecution of the Nonconformiſts, was not from the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, (as the Primitive Chriſtians:) Nor from <hi>Papiſts</hi> (as the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> of old, and all Diſſenters from them generally ever ſince:) Or any <hi>Proteſtants</hi> of a different Denomination; nor to death; but only Fines or Impriſonments. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet who went about to build any publick Places for Worſhip, or had ſuch, till a Tolleration was granted them? Who can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any ſo mad, as to build or buy publick Places, where their Enemies are Rulers; and having all Civil Power in their hands, would not only ſhut them up, or demoliſh them, but alſo ſeverely puniſh ſuch preſumption.</p>

               <head>SECT. 3.</head>
               <p>Our 2d Argument is from the defect of ſufficient Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies from Scripture, of the Chriſtians having any publick appropriate places in the Apoſtles time; or from authentick Authors, of any ſuch the two firſt Centuries. Nor let any think it ſufficient to ſay, that <hi>Argumentum ab autoritate non valet negative; an Argument from authority negatively, is of no force.</hi> For in Religion, Scripture ſo argues, not only in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62137:6"/>of our duty, becauſe never commanded; but alſo in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Hiſtory, as <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Our Lord ſprang out of Juda, of which Tribe Moſes ſpake nothing concerning Prieſthood.</hi> Whence by the way, we may gather, that our Saviour never went fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the Temple, not being a Prieſt of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> than the Outward Court. And in matters of Fact ſo many Hundred Years ago, this way of arguing is generally uſed and received. As <hi>Baronius</hi> uſeth it in a like caſe, <hi>A. D.</hi> 48. and others alſo frequently. For how ſhould we know, what was done ſo long ſince, but by Hiſtory. Now in all the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ſearchers into Antiquity, as <hi>Euſebius, Hierom, Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> and other Ancient Fathers and Authors, we find no footſteps of any publick Churches, the two firſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies; but many againſt them.</p>
               <p>For the Scriptures, whoſoever reads the <hi>Apoſtles Acts,</hi> which contain their Hiſtory about 32 Years; will find the Church aſſemblies ſtill in private Houſes, as <hi>c.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 12. ſo <hi>c.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 8. and to the very laſt, <hi>c.</hi> 28. <hi>v.</hi> 29, 30. ſo alſo in their Epiſtles. And the all places were indifferent to them in reſpect of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, yet not of conveniency; ſo that according thereto, no doubt they were appointed; and in the heat of Perſecution, ſuch as were moſt ſecret and ſecure.</p>
               <p>And will never find the <hi>Church</hi> therein taken for a Place. It being the general Opinion of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> which the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Lutheran, Gerrard de Eccleſ. c.</hi> 2. relates. <hi>In S. literis ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio Eccleſiae pro loco non occurrit; ſed progreſſu temporis factum, ut à Scriptoribus Eccleſiaſticis tandem reciperetur. Sed quilibet vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det hanc appellationem eſſe impropriam, &amp; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. In the Holy Scriptures, the Church is no where taken for a Place; tho in proceſs of time, it came to be ſo uſed in Eccleſiaſtical Writers. But every one ſees, the taking of it in this ſenſe, is improper and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachreſtical. Camero</hi> likewiſe, a Learned <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> in's <hi>Tract. de Eccleſia,</hi> and generally all of both Profeſſions. So that we may conclude as to the Scriptures, that however the grand Tyrant <hi>Cuſtom</hi> prevailed in after Ages, to call the Place by the name of <hi>Church,</hi> yet from the beginning it was not ſo.</p>
               <p>And for human Teſtimonies; for the firſt Ages ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Apoſtles, we might here produce very many, to prove the Primitive Chriſtians had no ſuch publick Churches or Temples. But in regard we ſuſtain the negative part, and our Opponents the affirmative, to whom the Proof moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62137:6"/>belongs, according to the Maxim, <hi>affirmanti incumbit probatio:</hi> And thoſe that favour our Adverſaries Opinion, will be apt to ſay, we do but beg the Queſtion; for that they have both Scripture, and good Humane Teſtimonies for them. We ſhall therefore firſt examine what they alledge; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards produce ſuch Witneſſes againſt them, as we ſhall willingly ſubmit to the judgment of all impartial Men, on which ſide the Truth lies. For if they can either by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or approved Authors, mantain their cauſe, we ſhall yield it; notwithſtanding the improbability therof, from the Perſecutions the Chriſtians were under in the firſt Ages. But here we muſt profeſs, that this being matter of fact, we are not to be put off, nor ſhall we acquieſce with conjectures or probabilities, ſuch as <hi>Platina, Polid. Virgil,</hi> &amp;c. urge, from the Apoſtles and Primitive Chriſtians zeal to promote Religion, (as if there could be none, without ſuch appropriate and conſecrated Places, as they call Churches) But there muſt be authentick Records, from approved Authors, that there were ſuch in the Apoſtles days, and the two firſt Ages after our Saviour; otherwiſe we can have no certainty of what was done at ſuch a diſtance from us, ſo many Ages agone.</p>

               <p>We ſhall therefore now enter the Liſts with our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and not decline any of their Weapons, being well ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd by the ſhield of Truth.

               <p>From Scripture, eſpecially 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.18, 20, 22. which <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine c.</hi> 4. <hi>de cultu ſanctorum,</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> produce for Churches and Oratories diſtinct from private Houſes in the Apoſtles days.

               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> likewiſe, who argues that from that the Apoſtle having ſaid, <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>when you come together in the Church,</hi> forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with expounds it by <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>when you come together in the ſame place;</hi> ſhewing by the <hi>Church</hi> he denotes the <hi>Place.</hi> But here he ſuppoſeth, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is to come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the ſame place; which is denied. For men cannot
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62137:7"/>come, or meet together, but in ſome place, either natural or artificial. <hi>Beza</hi> renders it <hi>in unum,</hi> others <hi>ſimul</hi> or <hi>conjuncti:</hi> I ſhould <hi>ad idem.</hi> For the expreſſion is Helleniſtical, and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies not only a Concourſe in the ſame place, but agreement. in condition, and concurrence in the ſame action, tho in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent places, according to the <hi>Septuagint.</hi> Even as in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.44. and other Texts it muſt be underſtood; for both the diverſity of Tongues, and multitude of Chriſtians, as <hi>five thouſand, c.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 4. manifeſt it could not be in the ſame place. <hi>Camero</hi> in his <hi>Myrothecium,</hi> ſhews the Phraſe is taken from the Septuagints Verſion of <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 2.2. where <hi>the Princes aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble together,</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, not in reference to the ſame place, but to their conjunction in heart and counſel about the ſame thing. Which ſence Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> follows, on <hi>Acts</hi> 1.15. If any object, if the Church be not the place, but the People, 'tis as much as to ſay, <hi>when you meet together in a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> But this is alſo denied, for <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>ſignifies on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the general Notion of <hi>coming together,</hi> or <hi>aſſembling,</hi> as <hi>Acts</hi> 11.26. but the <hi>Church,</hi> a ſpecial, <hi>viz.</hi> a holy Meeting. So that 'tis not the place, but the imployment, that gives the denomination. For as it is not in every place, where the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors or Parliament-men meet, that there is a Senate or Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. Nor in every place, where the Paſtors of the Church meet, is there forthwith a Synod. Seeing both ſorts may come together at Faſts or Feaſts, or other occaſions. But there and then only, where and when they meet to deliberate about affairs, Civil or Eccleſiaſtical. So whereſoever the Members of a Church come together, they are not for that ſaid to come together in the Church, but only then and there, when and where they come together for the exerciſe of Religion.</p>
               <p>But the chief Argument all our Opponents make uſe of, is from <hi>v.</hi> 22. where they aſſert an Antitheſis or Oppoſition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween private Houſes proper to each, and the Church which is common to all. Let us therefore duly conſider it. And (1.) That tho the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> be uſed above 100 times in the New Teſtament; yet this is the only place our <hi>Proteſtants</hi> inſiſt on for their Opinion. Altho <hi>Bellarmine</hi> alledgeth alſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.25. which yet clearly proves the contrary. (2.) We deny, as <hi>Camero</hi> in his Anſwer to <hi>Fuller, (Tract. de Eccleſ. c.</hi> 1.) that the oppoſition here, is made between the doing of any thing in this or that place; but in the preſence of others, or not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62137:7"/>in their preſence. As when one doth that in publick, which ſhould be done at home; we rate him ſaying, <hi>Haſt thou not an Houſe of thy own? Doſt thou deſpiſe the City? underſtanding not the Structures or Streets, but the faces of the Citizens who are there.</hi> And that this is the Apoſtles meaning, appears both by the following words, <hi>and ſhame them that have not:</hi> that is the poor Brethren, that had neither Money to buy, nor Proviſions to bring for their Feaſts of Charity (then in uſe at the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.) So that 'tis not deſpiſing the Place, but the Perſons; putting the poor (who are a great part of the Church) to bluſh and be aſhamed. And alſo by a parallel Place in this Epiſtle, <hi>c.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 34 <hi>&amp;</hi> 35. where the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle forbids their Women to ſpeak in the Churches, <hi>And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their Husbands at home; for it is a ſhame for Women to ſpeak in the Church.</hi> Where we ſee a plain oppoſition, between the Church and their own Home; which yet cannot be underſtood of the Church as a Place: The Caſe being clear, that it was not unlawful for Women to ſpeak in ſuch a Place ſimply, but only at ſuch a time when the Congregation was at Divine Worſhip: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it would be unlawful for any Woman, before or after Publick Worſhip, to ſpeak in the place. Nor was it ſinful ſurely, for Women to ſpeak at their Love-Feaſts, tho in the Church. Beſides, 'tis ſaid, <hi>your</hi> Women in the <hi>Churches,</hi> which implies, there were more than one Congregation in the Church of <hi>Corinth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not ſtand to alledge Commentaries on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.22. as <hi>Cajetan,</hi> who is abſolutely for the Congregation, and <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas,</hi> and <hi>Carthuſian,</hi> as alſo Dr. <hi>Pearſon</hi> on the Creed, <hi>p.</hi> 337. ſay, it may as well be ſo underſtood as of the place. But further prove the Truth (3.) By the Argument which the Apoſtle draws from the holineſs of the Meeting, and not from the holineſs of the Place, to take the <hi>Corinthians</hi> off from their Diſſentions, <hi>v.</hi> 18. for in every Meeting, Diſſentions are to be avoided; but in a holy Meeting, ordained for Religion, they ought to be deteſted. And ſo from Intemperance, <hi>v.</hi> 20, 21. ſhewing unity in the Truth of Doctrine, and unanimity in affections are neceſſary for the right receiving the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, in the following Verſes. And I would further argue with mine Opponents, ſuppoſe their meeting had been on ſome Mountain, or in ſome Cave, (which was not unuſual) and the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62137:8"/>faults here mentioned had been committed; ſhould they not have been liable to the ſame cenſure of deſpiſing the Church of God? But (4.) Should we grant the oppoſition they make, between the Church and their own Houſes, yet will not this ſerve to overthrow our Opinion, or eſtabliſh their own; except they can further prove, this Church or Place to have been publick, and not in a private Houſe, like unto others mentioned throughout the <hi>Acts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> carries this 22d verſe, for a reproof of the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> for uſing profane Banquetings and Feaſtings in a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred place, to introduce his Opinion of the holineſs of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, as <hi>Bellarmine c.</hi> 5. <hi>de cultu ſanct.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Satis inn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Neither doth the Apoſtle reprove them for any ſuch thing, but for their ſchiſmatical, unbrotherly and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Carriage therein. Theſe Love-Feaſts, <hi>a Lapide,</hi> as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin, Aquinas, Cajet an,</hi> and others, think preceeded; and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian</hi> as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and divers others, that they followed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Communion. The Opinions of the Ancients concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their order, are cited by theſe two Learned Jeſuites upon the place, where they may be ſeen; and the manner of them in <hi>Kerchers Roma Subterranea l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 27. As far as my reading reaches, tho theſe Love-Feaſts ſometimes were before as in the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> (as <hi>Sozomen</hi> ſaith, <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 19.) and ſome others: Yet more uſually they followed after the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. However, we have multiplicity of Teſtimonies in the Writings of the Ancients, for them at the Communion in the Primitive Church: and none I can find amongſt them for Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s Opinion, except <hi>Sedulius;</hi> nor amongſt the Modern, but <hi>Salmeroni;</hi> and theſe quite contrary to the genius of the Text.</p>
               <p>But he proceeds to tell us, that as moſt of the Words ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying an Aſſembly or Company, are wont to be uſed alſo for the place; ſo here <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Which we deny not in common Speech; but then the expreſſion is not proper, but figurative, <hi>continens pro contentis,</hi> the Place containing, for the Perſons contained. He cites St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> taking the Church here for the place of Meeting. It's true, he does ſo, on <hi>Leviticus, l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 57. to which <hi>Bede</hi> on the Text refers, but only for the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62137:8"/>time wherein the Congregation met, <hi>Eccleſia dicitur locus, quo Eccleſia congregatur:</hi> And it is apparent, that the faults men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by the Apoſtle, are ſuch only as were committed, at the time of their aſſembling for the Worſhip of God. Nor doth <hi>Auſtin</hi> appropriate it to a Place civil or artificial, as our Opponents do, not conſidering ſuch abuſes have their courſe in their Meetings in what place ſoever, natural or civil.</p>
               <p>The next Author he produceth is <hi>Baſil,</hi> who pleads for the Holineſs of Churches; of which hereafter.</p>
               <p>Commentators follow. The Author of the Comments on the Epiſtles (falſly aſcribed to <hi>Hierom</hi>) a <hi>Pelagian,</hi> ſeems to deliver the Opinion of others, rather than his own, ſaying, <hi>Quidam hunc locum ad illos referunt, qui Epulas in Eccleſia facie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant: facientes eam trielinium Epularum.</hi> And <hi>Seduſius</hi> (whom the former Author ſeems to point at) is of that Opinion, thinking it unlawful to keep their Feaſts in the Church. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is ſingular, and contrary to the Apoſtle, who rectifies the abuſe only, by admoniſhing them to <hi>ſtay one for another,</hi> and make their poor Brethren partakers with them of their Viands. Furthermore, even thoſe that take the Church for a holy Place, and cite this (as Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi> and ſeveral others) of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> making the Church <hi>trielinium Epularum,</hi> make it only a private Room, for <hi>trielinium</hi> was never taken for a Houſe, much leſs a publick one. To which may be added, the practice in after Ages, in St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s time, when the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans kept their Love-Feaſts <hi>in memoriis Martyrum,</hi> or in their Churches, as appears by his Anſwer to <hi>Fauſtus</hi> the <hi>Maniche, l.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 20, 21. at large.</p>
               <p>As for <hi>Chryſoſtom, Theodoret, Theophilact</hi> and <hi>Cecumenius,</hi> tho they take the Church for a Place; yet none of them as <hi>Mede,</hi> that the <hi>Corinthiaws</hi> fault was, in keeping there profane Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetings: Nor otherwiſe than in reference to the very time only, of their meeting therein. And whereas <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſays, the Church as well as the Poor were wronged; he cannot, I ſuppoſe, mean it of the Place, for Time and Place cannot be ſaid to be deſpiſed or diſhonoured, but by an extrinſecal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, when God is diſhonoured, or our Brethren, by our unchriſtian behaviour in the place. As here the latter member, being joyn'd thereto by a copulative, may fairly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the former (as uſually) <hi>viz.</hi> in ſhaming them that have not, you deſpiſe the Church, as <hi>Cajetan</hi> and <hi>Piſcator</hi> expound
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62137:9"/>it. So that tho the Grammatical oppoſition be between two places; yet the Logical and Theological is between a place of many preſent therein, and a private place. From theſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, <hi>Mede</hi> concludes there were places appointed, and ſet apart for Chriſtian Worſhip, even in the Apoſtles times.</p>
               <p>But tho no Man doubts, that believes the Goſpel, that the Chriſtians had places for Worſhip; yet it follows not thence, that they were ſet apart from all other uſes, for Chriſtian Worſhip. Neither doth he, or any other Opponent prove this. Places of meeting, the Ancients ſuppoſe, but ſeparate Places they ſuppoſe not. It was 200 Years and more, e'er they had Publick Oratories. And when the Heathen object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they had no Temples, Altars nor Images, they freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs as much.</p>
               <p>Having vindicated this Text in the <hi>Corinths,</hi> we ſhall briefly mention ſome others, alledged for ſeparate and publick Churches: Tho ſome are ſo far-fetch'd, they deſerve not mentioning. As Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. <hi>That all things be done decently, and in order,</hi> inferring that publick Offices be done in publick Places, as much as may be. And what, I pray, is more publick than the open Air, Mountains and Fields where our Saviour inſtructed his Followers?</p>
               <p>Likewiſe from <hi>Acts</hi> 19.9. <hi>Paul ſeparated the Diſciples, diſputing daily in the School of one Tyrannus:</hi> As if this School was one of the Temples of Chriſtians, which he confeſſeth was but borrowed, or hired for the urgent neceſſity.</p>
               <p>His next place is <hi>Acts</hi> 15.21. whence he argues, the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> from the beginning of their Commonwealth had Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues; ſo the Chriſtians from the day of Pentecoſt, Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. But that is very dubious; for tho I judge Synagogues much Ancienter than till after the Captivity (whence many Learned Men date them;) yet that they were ſo Ancient as he makes them, cannot be proved. Nor will <hi>Pſ.</hi> 74.8. ſerve, admitting various Tranſlations. The 70, <hi>They have put down the Feaſts; Hierome, Tabernacula; Montanus, Conventicula; Junius, Synagogas,</hi> which denotes all kinds of Aſſemblies, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Eccleſiaſtical, in their places; as <hi>Gerhard de Eccleſ. c.</hi> 1. §. 4. ſhews at large. Nor that of <hi>Pſ.</hi> 83.12 of which Sir <hi>H.

               <p>Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> from Scripture, proceeds to enquire, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Places theſe appropriate were, before he produceth the teſtimonies of Antiquity for ſuch. Where firſt he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges (as <hi>Baronius</hi> had before him) that they were not ſo goodly and ſtately, as after the Empire became Chriſtian, and we now enjoy: But ſome capable and convenient room, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62137:10"/>the Walls or Dwelling of ſome pious Diſciple, dedicated by him to the uſe of the Church, uſually an Upper-Room, ſuch as that called <hi>Caenaculum Sionis,</hi> where the Apoſtles and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples after our Saviour's Aſcenſion, uſually aſſembled, and the Holy Ghoſt fell upon them, on the day of Pentecoſt. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which place he brings a long Train of Traditions from <hi>Nicephorus;</hi> a moſt fabulous Author, in the judgment of all Learned Men; not worthy to be mentioned.</p>
               <p>Here let me obſerve the Difference amongſt our Opponents. (1.) As to the Place, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Baronius,</hi> as alſo our <hi>Fuller,</hi> conclude from that Text in the <hi>Corinths,</hi> for appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Houſes or Churches; but <hi>Mede</hi> only for one Room, uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally an upper, in an Houſe. (2.) <hi>Bellarmine</hi> would have theſe Houſes to be holy Temples, from the Chriſtian Sacrifices there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, meaning the Maſs, which he thinks is alone ſufficient for the denomination of a Temple. For <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>de cultu ſanctorum,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Templum nihil aliud eſt, quam locus Altaris. A Temple is no other thing than the place of an Altar:</hi> called alſo, <hi>baſilica,</hi> ſaith he, as erected at ſome Saints Sepulcher. <hi>Baronius</hi> and <hi>Fuller</hi> content themſelves with the diſtinction of Oratories, which tho poor and mean amongſt Chriſtians, in compariſon of the Heathens Temples, yet were thoſe Temples, as well as theſe. But <hi>Mede</hi> will have his rooms, by reaſon of the Owners Dedication, to be Oratories and Churches: Tho <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinian</hi> diſtinguiſhes theſe, (on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.) ſaying, <hi>Chriſtians had their meetings firſt in private Houſes, afterwards in Oratories and Churches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And whereas Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> diſcourſeth of a room and Houſe, in the ſingular number (as beſt ſuiting his Opinion of appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate places, even in the Apoſtles days) meaning without doubt, whereſoever there was a Church, as he inſtanceth in the <hi>coenaculum Sionis,</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> All this is nothing better than building upon the Sand. For conſidering the ſeveral cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in <hi>Acts c.</hi> 1. &amp; 2. its far more probable, that that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>upper Room,</hi> was in the Temple, than any private Houſe As appears from ſeveral Authors and Arguments gathered together in <hi>Pool's Synopſis,</hi> on <hi>Acts</hi> 1 13. to which I refer, being unwilling to tranſcribe ſuch Authors, as are common, and eaſily come at. Then what room could contain ſuch numbers, as 3000 <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41. which ſoon increaſed (as ſome think) to 5000, or more probably, (as others gather
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62137:10"/>from the Text <hi>Acts</hi> 4.4.) were ſo many more. The ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Potter</hi> on 666. <hi>ch.</hi> 36. from the multitude of Believers in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> computes that each of the Twelve Apoſtles might have about 500 under his care. Beſides, the Gift of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Tongues, implies their ſeveral meetings accordingly: for we muſt not fancy, as <hi>Salmaſius</hi> and ſome others, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſpake in any Language, was underſtood by all: becauſe this makes the Miracle to be in the Hearers, and not the Speakers; who were inſpired for preaching the Goſpel abroad in the Nations, whoſe Languages they were ignorant of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Conſider alſo that hot Perſecution that preſently fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the year after, in the 8th of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and whether this did not neceſſitate them, often to change the places of their aſſembling, it being neither ſafe to meet in great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, nor always in the ſame place. It's probable alſo, from <hi>v.</hi> 3. by <hi>Saul</hi>'s entring <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I paſs over the fabulous Traditions, and fictitious Gloſſes on <hi>Acts</hi> 10.9. and 18.22. eſpecially, as unworthy the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and the leaſt conſideration.

As alſo, that at length, they built Structures in the Coemeteries of Martyrs; which yet <hi>Platina</hi> and <hi>Polid.

               <p>We ſhall now proceed to examine their Teſtimonies: which Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> having moſt fully gathered, and regularly, of all our Opponents, ranked throughout the 3 firſt Centuries: We ſhall therefore follow his order, and paticularly conſider them, as he repreſents them. Altho we think it not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to expreſs all his words; his Works by many Editions, being in moſt Scholars hands. He begins with <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating a paſſage out of <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> concerning the <hi>Eſſenes,</hi> whoſe manner of Life and Worſhip <hi>Philo</hi> deſcribes (<hi>p.</hi> 376. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and more fully in his following Book <hi>de vita contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiva,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62137:11"/>p.</hi> 893. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of laſt Edition 1691.) Which place in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 17. <hi>Hiſt.

For its plain to any that peruſes <hi>Philo,</hi> that he ſpeaks of a Sect of <hi>Jews,</hi> who were <hi>Monks,</hi> and had each their proper place for Worſhip, called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and one <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>common,</hi> wherein they aſſembled for Worſhip every 7th day. Whereas the Chriſtians neither withdrew into Cells, nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the 7th, but the firſt day of the Week, from Chriſt's Reſurrection, and the day of Pentecoſt, which fell on the firſt, and after, as appears by Scripture. And however con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident <hi>Mede</hi> is, of <hi>Euſebius</hi> being of his Opinion, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry appears in's Book <hi>de prepar. Evangel. l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp; l.</hi> 13. <hi>c.</hi> 13. and <hi>Philo</hi>'s Book of the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> ſhews he was not of <hi>Mede</hi>'s mind.</p>
               <p>His next Argument is from the Apoſtles Salutations of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons, and the Church in his or their Houſe. Which he underſtands not of Families, (as he grants 'tis commonly taken) but the Congregation of Saints. Whence he infers, appropriate Places, and their Dedication by their Owners, to be Oratories for the Church in their ſeveral Cities. And he cites <hi>Lucian</hi>'s <hi>Philopatris,</hi> for their Deſcription.</p>
               <p>To which we reply,
<list>
                     <item>(1.) That this proves no more, than that Chriſtians had meetings in private Houſes, which none denies: which yet were often interrupted, not only in <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſian</hi>'s time, when they were examined if they kept their meetings in their Houſes, as appears in the <hi>Acts of Martyrs,</hi> but in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time alſo.</item>
                     <item>(2.) The Place in their Houſes, was but a <hi>caenaculum,</hi> or Dining-Room, as <hi>Mede</hi> grants; which as it was incapable of ſalutation, ſo of containing the whole Church in moſt of thoſe Cities. For who can think their Houſes, much leſs one room, ſo large, ſeeing <hi>Aquila</hi> was but a <hi>Tent-maker,</hi> baniſhed from <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Claudius,</hi> after whoſe Death he returned, before St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtle to the Church there, wherein <hi>c.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 5 he ſalutes the Church in their Houſe. And not only at <hi>Rome,</hi> but at <hi>Philippi,</hi> or <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> alſo, the Church that was in his Houſe, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.19. And what the reſt were that had Churches in their Houſes, we read not.</item>
                     <item>(3.) The Church in their Houſes is conſidered as diſtinct from themſelves, that were Maſters and Owners, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62137:11"/>thus it is fairly applied to their Families: But if to the whole Congregation, the Perſons whoſe Houſes they were, being Members thereof, as well as any others, it were very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. For ſo when St. <hi>Paul</hi> bids the Church of <hi>Rome, Salute the Church in</hi> Aquila <hi>and</hi> Priſcilla's <hi>Houſe, Rom.</hi> 16.5. his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that the <hi>Romans</hi> ſhould ſalute themſelves. So in wiſhing the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> (4.15.) to ſalute the Church in <hi>Nymphas</hi>'s Houſe, he deſires them to ſalute themſelves. And ſo of the reſt.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Now to ſay theſe Maſters of Houſes, beſtowed ſome part or place thereof to the Churches uſe, needs no proof (for none can lawfully enter into another man's Houſe, without his allowance) but that they Dedicated them, doth: For if Dedication was then uſed (of which hereafter) yet ſurely not by a private perſon. And whereas ſome ſingular thing muſt be meant, ſaith <hi>Mede,</hi> he concludes, this of the whole Church in their Houſe, muſt be it. Which is inconſequent. And tho it be unreaſonable, to demand a reaſon of anothers actions, which himſelf conceals; yet ſomething may be gathered for this, from the Apoſtle. As for <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> from <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.3, 4. and <hi>Acts</hi> 18.26. And as <hi>they were his helpers in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> that is in reference to the promoting the Goſpel: ſo were <hi>Nymphas</hi> alſo, and <hi>Philemon,</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> calls his <hi>fellow la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer.</hi> As for <hi>Lucian,</hi> cited alſo by <hi>Baronius,</hi> for proof of Houſes ſeparate: <hi>Vedelius</hi> anſwers,
<list>
                     <item>(1.) That the Dialogue <hi>Philopatris,</hi> is none of <hi>Lucian</hi>'s, <hi>ſed alterius alicujus ſcioli:</hi> and</item>
                     <item>(2.) That the place may as well be underſtood of a private as a publick Houſe.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>His 3d proof is from Tradition, That <hi>Theophilus</hi> to whom St. <hi>Luke</hi> inſcribes his Goſpel and Acts, converted his Houſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Church; derived from the <hi>Traditions of Clemens.</hi> As <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> likewiſe mentioned, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.21. a <hi>Roman</hi> Senator and Martyr from the <hi>Acta Pudentis.</hi>

               <p>His laſt Teſtimony is from <hi>Clemens</hi>'s <hi>Epiſtola ad Corinthios,</hi> who ſpeaking of Gods Worſhip under the Goſpel, ſaith, <hi>He hath determined where and by whom, &amp;c.</hi> Whence <hi>Mede</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, Places, as well as Times and Perſons, were appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and diſtinct, in the Apoſtles days.

               <p>To which I anſwer (1.) That 'tis granted this Epiſtle is authentick. <hi>Grotius</hi> hath in a large Epiſtle approved it. <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſius de Epiſe. &amp; Presbyt.</hi> and <hi>Blundel</hi> and <hi>Hammond</hi> in their Diſciplinarian Controverſies, own it for genuine. <hi>Junius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Fell,</hi> in their Notes vindicate it; tho I know, a late Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, <hi>Erneſtus Teutzelius</hi> a <hi>German</hi> hath largely anſwered them, and pronounces the Epiſtle ſpurious; eſpecially for the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Phoenix therein. Whom I have had thoughts to refute, and animadvert on ſome others that have nibled at it, when I get time to publiſh various Obſervations I have upon it. For Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> in's Introduction to his Tranſlation, <hi>c.</hi> 2. hath only touched thereon. But (2.) What needs Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> to make ſuch a ſtir about <hi>Clemens</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, when the Scripture hath determined, that God under the Goſpel is to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped every where, as <hi>Malachy</hi> 1.11. <hi>From the riſing of the Sun to the going down of the ſame.</hi> And our Saviour himſelf ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies as much, <hi>John</hi> 4.20, 21, 22, 23. where he declares who are the true Worſhippers of God under the Goſpel, without any reference to place, in oppoſition to the worſhipping him, in this or that place; whether on the Mount where the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs worſhipped him of old, or at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> where the <hi>Jews</hi> worſhipped him afterwards. As <hi>Gorran</hi> obſerves, <hi>locali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem excludit: He excludes appropriation to any place, as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Gods worſhip;</hi> and adds, <hi>non determinat locum orationis ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enbi, ſed ubique; determines not the place of prayer to any particular place, but enlarges it to every place.</hi> To every private Houſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.11, to the top of an Houſe, 10.9. to the Sea ſhore, 21.5. ſo the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1, 2. <hi>In every place call on the Name of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord;</hi> and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. <hi>I will, that men pray every where.</hi> And undoubtedly <hi>Clement</hi> could not be ignorant
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62137:12"/>of this, conſidering the perſecuting times wherein he lived, when the Churches of God were driven from place to place, and conſtrained to meet as they could, with moſt ſafety.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Mede</hi>'s ſaying, that <hi>Clemen</hi>'s Divine Ordinance, for the place of Church Service, is to be found in the Analogy of the Old Teſtament; ſeems very ſtrange. For the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was the only place God appointed for the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Worſhip. And ſhould the Chriſtians by Analogy have but one Temple?

               <p>In the Second Century, Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> begins with the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of <hi>Ignatius</hi> the Martyr, <hi>A. D.</hi> 107. Firſt with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Epiſtle <hi>ad Magneſios;</hi> and then with the ſpurious <hi>ad Antiochenos.</hi>

               <p>But had he lived to have ſeen what is now extant, of and concerning theſe Epiſtles, by the great Luminaries of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Age, A. B. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher, Dally,</hi> Bp. <hi>Pearſon, Larock, &amp;c.</hi> he would never have laid ſuch ſtreſs upon them. The mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt difference between the ancient genuine Copies, and the latter, is evident by their Tranſlations; particularly that of <hi>Caius</hi> College in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> which A.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62137:13"/>Altar Jeſus Chriſt, and ſpiritual Sacrifices offered to God, in him as on an Altar, whereby they become acceptable.</p>
               <p>Not to inſiſt upon <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or <hi>Temple,</hi> no ways agreeing to the meeting places of the Primitive Chriſtians: as both <hi>Bellar. de Rom. Pontif. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 13. and <hi>Vedelius</hi> hath ſhewn ſufficiently, from the Ancient Fathers. And that which follows in <hi>Mede,</hi> of one Biſhop, and one Altar, in every Church, is not only alien to the ſcope of <hi>Ignatius,</hi> but the Truth alſo. For the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> had <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, or <hi>Biſhops, Acts</hi> 20.28. ſo had the <hi>Philipians,</hi> 1.1. and of <hi>Jeruſalem, Narciſſus</hi> and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> who at the ſame time jointly governed the Church, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> relates. <hi>Gerſom Bucer</hi> in's Anſwer to <hi>Downam</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>p.</hi> 302. proves the like in other Churches, by ten in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: and <hi>Vedelius</hi> the ſame, <hi>Exercit.</hi> 8. <hi>in Epiſt. Ignat. c.</hi> 3. And <hi>Epiphanius</hi> of old, profeſſed that the Church of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> was ſingular in this, of having but one Biſhop. It's true, the Inſcription of the 7 Epiſtles, <hi>Apoc. c.</hi> 2 <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. each, to the particular Angel of the Church, ſeems to imply that they had but one apiece. Which yet Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> himſelf ſufficiently ſhews is inconſequent, in's Comment on <hi>Apocal. p.</hi> 265. where he obſerves it the courſe in Scripture, to attribute that to one Angel, which is performed by the Miniſtry of many. What's alledged from <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> is anſwered by <hi>Bucer;</hi> and <hi>Sozomen</hi> acquaints us, (<hi>Hiſt. Eccl. l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 3.) That even Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges had their Biſhops; and no wonder then, if one <hi>Lords Table</hi> in each might ſuffice to make them correlatives.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> proceeds with another proof out of <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Epiſtle <hi>ad Antiochenos,</hi> (wherein he ſalutes the Keepers of the holy Doors) concluding thence holy Houſes. This Epiſtle he endeavours to perſwade us is genuine (contrary to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all other <hi>Proteſtants</hi>) from ſundry probabilities.</p>
               <p>But this is a ſtrange way of reaſoning, That it's likely ſuch a thing ſhould be done, and therefore it was done. And to ſay, becauſe the <hi>Antiochians</hi> were his own Flock, I think ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther makes it improbable; becauſe he had ſufficiently eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in the Faith before he leſt them; which, when he went thence to <hi>Rome,</hi> to receive the Crown of Martyrdom, he endeavoured by his Epiſtles to do for other Churches. And ſurely they would have been careful above all other Churches, in keeping their own Paſtor's Letter, if he had ſent them one. And was not <hi>Polycarp</hi> as likely to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62137:13"/>with this, as the reſt. Beſides that, if he or <hi>Euſebius</hi> had had any inkling of ſuch an Epiſtle, ſurely they would have mentioned it, tho they could not meet with it. And how doth <hi>Mede</hi> prove any ſuch Officers in the Primitive Churches? that which he alledges for this from the <hi>Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Conſtitutions,</hi> falſly father'd on <hi>Clemens,</hi> is yet ſtranger. For beſides others, my Learned Countriman <hi>Cook,</hi> in's <hi>cenſura Scriptorum,</hi> hath detected ſo much vanity, and many Lyes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (whereof he reckons Eight) beſides the cenſures of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius,</hi> the 6 Synod in <hi>Trullo, Binius, Baronius, Bovius</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine;</hi> that I wonder Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> who knew all this, ſhould once offer to produce them. I know Mr. <hi>Cook</hi> and many Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Divines reject all <hi>Ignatius</hi>'s Epiſtles: altho others, conſidering the Teſtimonies of the Ancients, acknowledge 7 for genuine, ſpecified by <hi>Euſebius, Hierom</hi> and others, tho robbed of ſome paſſages mentioned by the Fathers; and alſo have a number of beggarly patches added to his Purple, as A. B. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> ſaith: Of which 7, this <hi>ad Antiochenos</hi> is none, and therefore not genuine; for more were not found nor acknowledged by <hi>Polycarp</hi> (who compoſed them together) <hi>Euſeb. Hierome, Sophronius</hi> and <hi>Ruffinus.</hi>

               <p>Not to mention the many Authors, who have handled this Argument of the Maſs, againſt <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and other <hi>Papiſts</hi> largely.

And for the name of <hi>Title,</hi> that was given at pleaſure. So that were theſe ſpurious Epiſtles authentick, they neither prove our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries Opinion, nor diſprove ours.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> produceth next <hi>Theophilus Antiochenus, l. 2. ad Antolycum;</hi> who ſaith, <hi>God hath given Synagogues, which we call holy Churches,</hi> &amp;c. Which yet is confeſt by him to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if it were probable</hi> Synagogue <hi>was here taken, as uſually in the New Teſtament for a place, then</hi> Church <hi>likewiſe for a place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which we ſay, that if Church, in a hundred places of the New Teſtament, be taken for a Congregation: then 'tis moſt probable, it's ſo taken here. And the ſenſe of the words makes this evident; for <hi>Theophilus</hi> compares Hereſies to rocky Iſlands; and the wholeſome Doctrine of Truth and Holineſs, to good and habitable Iſlands; and not the places of Truth and Hereſies.</p>
               <p>The laſt Author in this 2d Century alledged, is <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus;</hi> who uſeth the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Church,</hi> for the Place, and not the Congregation only, <hi>Stromat. l.</hi> 7. And ſo again in the ſtory of the young man, who had left the Church, and betook himſelf to a Mountain with Robbers.</p>
               <p>That Chriſtians had places of meetings is beyond all doubt; but we ſay in private Houſes and Places for 200 years and upwards. Nor doth <hi>Clemens</hi> or any other, prove they had publick Oratories. And <hi>Vedelius,</hi> p. 74. upon this paſſage of <hi>Clemens,</hi> ſhews, they did not think this appellation ſo proper and convenient. Therefore <hi>Salvian</hi> 200 years after, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>de gub.

               <p>Thus for the two firſt Centuries, we have heard the noiſe of our Adverſaries Artillery, which was nothing but Powder, and vaniſhed into Smoak, without any Shot, that might in the leaſt wound our cauſe.</p>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> goes on with the 3d Century, wherein we ſhall follow him at the Heels, tho not obliged thereto, by our Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For I know no <hi>Proteſtant</hi> that in this Century denies Chriſtian Oratories; but only in the two firſt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis not fair to feign Adverſaries, and repreſent us as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that we willingly grant. We know well, the Church being conſiderably increaſed, Oratories were built; and the fate that followed them, namely, to be demoliſhed. For <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> relates, how before <hi>Diocleſian</hi>'s days, there was both an enlargement of Churches formerly built; and an addition of new, more large and ſtately than the former, which were alſo deſtroyed in his Reign; and towards the end of this 3d Age the Chriſtians not only queſtioned for affording their private Houſes to meet in, but moreover tortur'd for it. Add hereunto, that <hi>Mede</hi> ſtill goes on to pervert the ſtate of the Queſtion: as if private Houſes and ſecret places in ſore Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions (which none denies) were publick Oratories, Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es or Temples. The firſt Author cited by him is <hi>Tertullian</hi> in three places, whereof the firſt hath reference to the Aſſembly; and if to the place, yet only to the time of Worſhip; for which an upper room ſerved; as <hi>Hoſpinian (de orig.

               <p>I ſhall not meddle with what is added of Churches ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looking Eaſtward; (for which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> gives <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But how will he, or any other prove that there were any Baptiſteries in <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s time, diſtinct from the places of their Aſſemblies. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpinian</hi> that was well verſed in Eccleſiaſtical Antiquities, finds none before <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time, <hi>de orig. baptiſterii, p.</hi> 30, 31. For as no place for Baptiſm was preſcribed by Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, but leſt indifferent, and accordingly uſed at firſt: ſo we find nothing certain concerning this in the Primitive Church. The Hiſtory of <hi>Baſilides</hi> in <hi>Euſeb. l.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 5. mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts that ſome were baptiſed in Priſons, and <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Epiſtle to <hi>Magnus,</hi> that ſick perſons were baptiſed in their Beds. Nor doth it follow, the <hi>Church</hi> here is not the <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> becauſe that was alſo at the Baptiſtery. For if there were ſuch (as I think there was not) yet a part more likely was only there; and probably the abrenunciation was not the ſame day. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, without all doubt, it was not made but when the Church was aſſembled, and reſpected the Aſſembly and not the Place.

               <p>This Author is cited by the <hi>Rhemiſts,</hi> to prove that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhould aboliſh their Maſs: but of ſmall or no account with <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> For he makes Antichriſt to be the Devil, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in the ſhape of a Man; and that <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> is not yet dead, but ſhall continue with <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> till the

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> agrees not to Chriſtian Churches, as both <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Vedelius</hi> have largely proved, which we mentioned before.</p>
               <p>For the ſame time <hi>Lampridius</hi> an Hiſtorian is cited, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, <hi>Quod cum Chriſtiani quendam locum, qui publicus flier at, occupaſſent; contra Popinarii dicerent, ſibi cum deberi;</hi> Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mammeae <hi>Imperator reſcripſit: melius eſſe, ut quomodo cunque Deus illic colatur, quam Popinarits dedatur. That when the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had poſſeſt a publick place; which the Victualers challeng'd to belong to them;</hi> Alexander <hi>the Emperour determined; it was better, that God ſhould be there any manner of way worſhipped, than that the Victualers ſhould have it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Paſſage is brought by <hi>Baronius, A. D.</hi> 57. <hi>num.</hi> 101. for the ſame purpoſe; who yet afterwards, <hi>A. D.</hi> 224. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth, that at that time the Chriſtians had no Church there, but choſe that place to build one in. For which he alledgeth a fabulous Miracle. But <hi>Platina</hi> in the life of <hi>Calixtus,</hi> believes not this, by reaſon of the frequent Perſecutions in thoſe days. <hi>Calixtus</hi> himſelf having ſuffered Martyrdom. And <hi>Baronius</hi> acknowledgeth, that Perſecution was frequent in this Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Alexander</hi>'s days, and divers ſuffered Martyrdom, even the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> himſelf. So that 'tis doubtful, whether they built any publick Oratory, in that publick place, during his Reign; and if they did, 'tis the firſt we read of in any Claſſic Author.</p>
               <p>The next Author is <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Neocaeſarea,</hi> Sirnamed <hi>Thau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matourgus,</hi> who in an Epiſtle called <hi>canonica,</hi> deſcribes the Diſcipline then in uſe, with the diſtinct and regular places for <hi>Penitents,</hi> (who ſtood without the Gate of the Oratory) <hi>Auditors,</hi> and others that ſtood within, as the <hi>Catechumens</hi> and <hi>Faithful</hi> in diſtinct places.</p>
               <p>And further in's Life written by <hi>Gregory Niſſen,</hi> 'tis ſaid, that he was a great Founder and Erecter of Churches; whereof that built by him at <hi>Neocaeſarea</hi> in <hi>Fontus</hi> (where he was Biſhop) <hi>Gregory Niſſen</hi> ſaith, was ſtill ſtanding in his time, having remained unſhaken in a great Earthquake,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62137:16"/>which had thrown down all other Edifices both publick and private.</p>
               <p>Now let it be granted, That this Canonical Epiſtle is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine; tho I will not ſay, as <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie 'tis ſo; even for that which he ſaith is certain. That this <hi>Gregory</hi> made a ſhort Confeſſion of Faith, which he learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> appearing unto him in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the bleſſed Virgin, the Mother of God: and the many monſtrous Fables father'd on this devout Man, by the name of Miracles. But becauſe <hi>Balſamon,</hi> the learned Canoniſt, hath commented upon it, I ſhall not reject it; tho neither Chriſt our Lord and Lawgiver, nor his Apoſtles, no nor the Church of the Firſt Age, (wherein like occaſions were given by defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) ever made ſuch orders, or uſed ſuch diſtinctions of places: which any conſidering man will judge, more befitting peaceable than perſecuting times.</p>
               <p>And (2.) We further grant, as we have ſeveral times ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, that in this Third Century the Chriſtians had their publick Oratories, ſmall at the firſt, and afterwards enlarged, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> teſtifies, <hi>Hiſt. l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 1. tho moſt in ſecret, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Perſecution. So that neither this, nor the following Teſtimonies, prejudice our Aſſertion: nor prove theirs, of ſuch publick and ſeparate places of Worſhip, both in and ever ſince the Apoſtles times.</p>
               <p>But how <hi>Gregory Niſſen</hi> came to believe, that the Temple <hi>Thaumaturgus</hi> built, continued till his time, I know not. For whoſoever conſiders the many Edicts, made by Heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors between theſe two <hi>Gregory</hi>'s days, for demoliſhing them all, will think this incredible. Except ſome Ruderaes remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a Temple after built upon them, was accounted the ſame; like as that which we read in the Goſpel, of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Porch. Or that it was preſerved by a Miracle, as <hi>Baronius</hi> thinks, and that a greater, than its preſervation in the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake. For the Decree of <hi>Diocleſian</hi> was very general and ſevere, for demoliſhing all Churches; which both <hi>Theodoret</hi> and <hi>Euſebius</hi> write, was ſo punctually executed, that all were pulled down, not one by them excepted. And this Decree came forth from <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> a City in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> upon which <hi>Pontus</hi> bordered, wherein <hi>Neocaeſarea</hi> ſtood, and therefore ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unlikely this ſhould be ſpared.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:62137:16"/>
               <p>But if any have ſo ſtrong a Faith to believe, what is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of this great Wonder-worker <hi>Gregory,</hi> he may poſſibly think that he had ſufficient power to reſtrain <hi>Diocleſian</hi>'s Agents, and defend the Church he built. For <hi>Baronius</hi> at the Year 253. <hi>num.</hi> 135, 136, 137. relates what power he had over Devils, to caſt them out of their Temples, and drive them out of any place, whither he pleaſed, and reſtore them alſo at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: which he did, to ſhew his power, to one in writing under his hand, ſaith <hi>Baronius,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Gregorius Satanae, ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere; Gregory to Satan, enter in,</hi> that was into his Temple again. And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> relates another Miracle of him upon this very Argument, <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>de cultu Sanct.</hi> ſaying, That when he would have built a Church, and wanted room, by reaſon of a Rock, that border'd on the place, where he would build it, he by his prayers removed it away. Mr <hi>Mede</hi> was wiſer than to mention this, for <hi>Gregory</hi>'s building of Churches. And indeed none can imagine, how much prejudice ſuch fabulous Miracles and lying Legends (decryed and deteſted even by many ſober and Learned <hi>Papiſts</hi>) hath done to Chriſtianity. Let but any one read a Pamphlet Printed this very Year, of a Conference between a <hi>Jew</hi> and a <hi>Jeſuite,</hi> at <hi>Amſterdam;</hi> concerning Chriſt being the true Meſſiah, which this undertaking to prove by his Miracles; was replied upon by the other, with a Number as great, out of many <hi>Popiſh</hi> Authors, inſomuch that the <hi>Jew</hi> quite confounded the <hi>Jeſuite.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And wheras Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> notes, that a litle before the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Decius</hi> (which was A. D. 252.) the Chriſtians erected Oratories, in the Name of Chriſt. I deſire <hi>Baronius</hi> may be conſulted, and then let any one judge, how improbable it is that Chriſtians had publick Churches, with ſuch diſtinction of places, as is mentioned or built ſuch Publick Oratories, as our Adverſaries ſay. For <hi>Decius</hi> gave expreſs order to forbid all Chriſtian aſſemblies; upon pain of Death, threatning accurate ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving them; (becauſe many Heathens were converted thereby to Chriſtianity.) As appears by <hi>Aemilianus</hi> his writing to <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Euſeb. l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 9. <hi>vel</hi> 10. and <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius ad A. D.</hi> 260. <hi>Num.</hi> 17. who further relates, how their very <hi>Coemateria</hi> or burying places (which were Vaults under ground, called <hi>cryptae,</hi> as <hi>Baronius ſhews A. D.</hi> 259 <hi>num.</hi> 16.) uſually a Mile or more from their Cities (which were often after ſome time diſcovered; and then how dangerous it was
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62137:17"/>to meet there, he ſhews. <hi>A</hi> 255) were now ſtrictly forbidden them in particular, as well as in the general all other places whatſoever.</p>

               <p>We never doubted, but Chriſtians had from the firſt Oratories, or places of Meeting: And that in this Century ſome publick, which as the Church increaſed, were inlarged. But that even in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time their aſſembling were in ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneous Vaults; both at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as we have ſhewn; and <hi>Rome,</hi> as is clear by Pope <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s Letter to the Biſhop of <hi>Vienna,</hi> as <hi>Baronius</hi> teſtifies <hi>A.</hi> 255. <hi>n.</hi> 47. and here at <hi>Carthage</hi> in <hi>Africa, A.</hi> 260. <hi>n.</hi> 37. Where the Proconſul urged <hi>Cyprian</hi> himſelf with the Emperors Edict, <hi>ne in aliquibus locis conciliabula fiant, nee caemeteria ingrediantur; that the Chriſtians ſhould not meet in any places, nor enter into their Coemeteries.</hi> In which they uſually celebrated the holy Myſteries; which <hi>Pameltus</hi> calls the <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> but <hi>Goulartius, the Word, Sacraments and Prayers;</hi> performed only, when the Church aſſembled. Nor is the oppoſition mentioned, of any force, as we ſhew'd on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.22.</p>
               <p>Another Contemporary cited, is <hi>Dionyſius Alexandrinus</hi> in's Epiſtle to <hi>Baſilides,</hi> declaring his Opinion, That Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men during the time of their Separation, ought not to enter into the Church, which he calls <hi>the Houſe of God.</hi> By which we learn, ſaith <hi>Mede,</hi> not only the Chriſtians had their Houſes of Worſhip, but a religious reſpect alſo, to difference them from common places.</p>
               <p>To this we ſay, as formerly, That Chriſtians had always places for meeting in, but ſtill whether in private Houſes, or in publick lies the queſtion. And if but a Chamber in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Houſe, where they worſhipped God, it was ſufficient to denominate it the Houſe of God, as well as a Cathedral. And that their Aſſemblies then were very private, appears in that they were forbidden on pain of death (as we have ſhewn) and yet where this is related by <hi>Euſebius, Dionyſius</hi> teſtifies, that nevertheleſs they kept them. But ſurely not in the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al places, where they had eaſily been diſcovered, to the loſs of their lives; but in all likelihood often changed the places,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62137:17"/>for their ſecurity. And whether every ſuch, was thereby ſo ſanctified, that it was unlawful for a menſtruous Woman to enter thereinto, let any one judge. Nor was this a Canon, as <hi>Mede</hi> calls it, <hi>Baronius</hi> hath made apparent againſt <hi>Balſamon;</hi> and by the equity of a contrary courſe taken by Pope <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> in regard that <hi>legalia</hi> or <hi>ceremonials</hi> are now abdicated. And if it were in force, it relates not to the Place ſimply, but the Offices there performed, and the time thereof, which ſuppoſe the Congregation preſent, from which ſuch an one was to be excluded, whether the meeting was on a Mountain, or in an Houſe, or under Ground, <hi>in Caves and Dens of the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor need Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> tell us, ſuch places were known to the Gentiles, and called <hi>worſhipping places.</hi> For when the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were grown ſo numerous, before this time of <hi>A D.</hi> 260. as <hi>Tertullian</hi> thinks, near to equalize the Heathens; their Aſſemblies could not poſſibly be concealed, whether above or under the Ground (eſpecially when they enjoyed any tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble freedom from Perſecution) as appears by two Reſcripts of <hi>Gallienus</hi> in <hi>Euſeb. Hiſt. l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 12. one for reſtoring all places in general to the Chriſtians, and the other their Coemiteries in particular.</p>
               <p>Nor doth <hi>Aurelian</hi>'s Speech in <hi>Vopiſcus</hi> evince a publick place; nor the oppoſition between the Capitol and Church imply the place; but the Congregation rather, that ſtands in congruous oppoſition to the <hi>Sibyls</hi> Oracles. For they might be Maſters of the Chriſtian Oratories when they pleaſed, and there conſult of what they liſt, even of ſetting forth the Books of the <hi>Sibyls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> thinks his cauſe is ſupported by that of <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius l.</hi> 7. relating how <hi>Paulus Samoſatenus</hi> being depoſed by the Council, <hi>Aurelian</hi> decreed, that <gap reason="foreign">

So <hi>Baronius</hi> takes it, <hi>A. D.</hi> 272. <hi>num.</hi> 18. and our Learned Antiquary Sir <hi>H. Spelman, de non temerandis Eccleſiis, p.</hi> 64. for a Houſe belonging to the Church of <hi>Antioch.</hi> And indeed 'tis not reaſonable to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62137:18"/>it, of a publick Temple, as <hi>Fuller</hi> calls it; for to what purpoſe ſhould he keep that, which could be of no uſe to him, neither for an Habitation, nor for publick Worſhip, being deprived of his Biſhoprick for Hereſie, and <hi>Domnus</hi> in his place: and the Congregation could keep him out of, without troubling the Emperour. Nor is it denied, that in the time <hi>Euſebius</hi> mentions between the 9 and 10 Perſecution, for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 30 Years, ſeveral old Oratories or Churches were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and new built; like as 'tis manifeſt they were demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by <hi>Diocleſian</hi> 40 years after. And were the 3 places of <hi>Euſebius</hi> alledged, taken for the place; they ſpeak of no more than an Houſe or Houſes, which denotes them private, not publick, as Churches and Temples.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> lays mighty ſtreſs on <hi>Euſebius</hi> calling them <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, which he renders <hi>priſca aedificia, ancient edifices:</hi> and from thence infers, that therefore there were Oratories or Churches, even in the Apoſtles times. For he tells us, the Learned define <hi>ſaeculum, an age,</hi> to denote 100 years: and that one age is not ſufficent to denominate houſes <hi>priſca,</hi> or <hi>antient;</hi> conſidering that <hi>monas</hi> an <hi>unity,</hi> is not to be accounted a number; wherefore they muſt be of two Ages at leaſt, or more, to be termed Ancient.</p>
               <p>But all this is very ſtrange talk. For

                     <item>(1.) <hi>Euſebius</hi> hath nothing anſwerable to <hi>ſaeculum an age.</hi>

                     <item>(2.) If <hi>monas an unity</hi> be no number; then one hundred years, or one thouſand. is no number; and ſo ſhould be inſufficient to denominate any thing ancient.</item>

                     <item>(4.) Let it be conſidered, that we read of no Edifices before <hi>Decius</hi> and <hi>Valerians</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution: and thoſe ſpecified only by <hi>coemiteria, places of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,</hi> in which they had their <hi>cryptae, Vaults under Ground;</hi> which were forbidden them, and again reſtored and granted them by <hi>Gallienas.</hi> Now this Perſecution by <hi>Decius</hi> and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerian,</hi> was but about 40 years before <hi>Diocleſian</hi>'s: ſo that if we take the Phraſe for the time intervening, it imports no more than Edifices formerly built, and thoſe not very ancient.</item>
                     <item>(5.) <hi>New and Old,</hi> are Terms of reſpect, and taken in great latitude; ſo that now a Man of an hundred years, is truly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62137:18"/>a very old man; tho in the <hi>antedeluvian</hi> days, one of 200 but young, when Men lived to eight or nine hundred. And tho ſome of our Churches in <hi>England</hi> may be termed truly ancient, being perhaps of 6 or 700 years ſtanding; yet the eldeſt in <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s time, could not be 300; nor hath any yet been proved to have been then an hundred years old.

               <p>Mr. <hi>Mede</hi>'s laſt Witneſs, which he ſaith will diſpatch all at once, and depoſe for the whole, and thinks alone ſufficient to carry his Cauſe, is <hi>Euſeb. Hiſt.

               <p>But if this Witneſs will depoſe for the whole, there's no thanks due to Mr. <hi>Mede;</hi> conſidering that long before, this was diſpatch'd; <hi>Baronius</hi> having alledged the ſame, and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delius</hi> anſwered him, (as he could not but know) <hi>Exercit, in epiſt. ad Magneſ.

Thirdly, Baronius cites the 8th Book of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius</hi> c. 1. <hi>and ſaith, that he affirmeth Churches to have been long before Diocleſians time. But 'tis falſe to ſay, Euſebius ſpeaks of the time long before Diocleſians Reign. For he ſpeaks only of that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62137:19"/>part of time, intermediating between the</hi> 9 <hi>and</hi> 10 <hi>Porſecution, (or according to the computation of others the 8th and 9th) as the ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the preceeding ſtory, and the Text it ſelf ſufficiently ſhew. Now the Perſecution preceeding</hi> Diocleſian<hi>'s began</hi> A. D. 272. <hi>under the Emperour</hi> Valerian, <hi>and ended about</hi> 10 <hi>years after.

As if I ſhould ſay,</hi> Euſebius <hi>teſtifies, That for about</hi> 30 <hi>years before</hi> Diocleſian <hi>there were Churches: therefore he ſaith that there were Churches</hi> 300 <hi>years before</hi> Diocleſian. <hi>But this courſe is frequently uſed by</hi> Baronius, <hi>that corrupter of Chronicles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that <hi>Mede</hi> inſiſts on moſt, (as others before him) is that Phraſe in <hi>Euſebius</hi>

                  <hi>ancient Edifices.</hi> Which how far it may reach, faith he, let others judge.</p>
               <p>Belike he truſted more to his Readers forwardneſs, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the ſuſpicions this Phraſe might raiſe, at firſt ſight in their minds, than his own improvement of it; that he turns it off with ſo ſhort and ſlender a Remark, which in ſhew was his moſt pregnant proof. Or knowing that <hi>Fuller</hi> had done his beſt on the Phraſe, waved the ſpeaking further thereon. However, having ſpoken ſufficiently, I think, to it in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Paragraph, I need ſay nothing more in this.</p>
               <p>But that <hi>Euſebius</hi> mentions there, and alſo <hi>c.</hi> 2. and 6. is very remarkable; and lets us ſee, that tho Proſperity be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired of all, yet few can uſe it aright: ſo that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, if it were beſt for God's People, they ſhould enjoy it. For from <hi>Valerian</hi>'s Perſecution to <hi>Diocleſian</hi>'s, the Church had a comfortable calm (<hi>Aurelian</hi>'s Edict made for Perſecution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never ſigned by him, God having terrified him with Lightning (as <hi>Eutropius</hi> and <hi>Vopiſcus</hi> affirm) and ſo ſtopt his wicked Tyranny.) But alas, inſtead of being better'd, they extreamly degenerated: So that <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaith, God ſent that direful ſtorm of Perſecution on them under <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> for the corruptneſs of their lives and manners. <hi>Maximè vero Eccleſiaſticorum, in quorum vultu ſimulationem, in corde dolum, verbis fallaciam cernere licuit: livore, ſuperbia, inimicitiis inter ſe certantes, tyrannidem potius quam ſacerdotium ſapere videbantur; Chriſtianae pietatis omnino obliti; divina myſteria profanabant potius, quam celebrabant.</hi> Which I forbear to <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Thoſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62137:19"/>that pleaſe may read more in <hi>Fox</hi>'s Martyrology in the 9th Primitive Perſecution? tho he miſreckon it, there having been no general Perſecution in <hi>Aurelian</hi>'s Reign, who as he himſelf ſaith, <hi>rather intended, than moved Perſecution.</hi> But for their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs followed the 10th. When their Churches were demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, their Bibles burnt, their Perſons puniſhed with all kinds of cruelty; neither Courtiers, nor Friends, not the Empreſs <hi>Priſca,</hi> nor Daughter <hi>Valeria</hi> ſpared; his Decree was <hi>aut Deos Gentilium, aut mortem eligerent; That the Chriſtians ſhould chooſe either the Heathen Gods or Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of this Tenth and greateſt Perſecution, <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his 8th Book of Hiſtory. <hi>Lactantius de mortibus Perſecutorum,</hi> from 7 to 49 Chap. with the Notes in <hi>Latin</hi> of 1693, which are 10 times larger than the Text. And <hi>Fox</hi> in his firſt book of Martyrology, from <hi>Euſebius</hi> and ſeveral others, have written largely; which I ſhall not tranſcribe, but diſmiſs with this ſhort remark; That of all the 10 general Perſecutions, this laſt (which was the foreſt, and continued above Ten Years,) only reached <hi>England;</hi> wherein <hi>Albanus</hi> firſt, and very many after, ſealed their Faith in Chriſt with their blood; ſo that Chriſtianity was almoſt with the Scriptures, and Churches deſtroyed throughout the whole Kingdom, tho ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after revived by the bleſſed <hi>Conſtantine.</hi>

               <p>Having now examined all our Adverſaries Witneſſes we leave the Impartial Reader to judge of their validity; and whether they prove the Chriſtians to have had any publick appropriate places for Worſhip in the two firſt Centuries. Which tho undoubtedly moſt ſit and convenient always; yet in times of Perſecution, men muſt do as they may, and meet as ſecretly as they can, and be conſtrained, often to change their meeting places, and when private Houſes will not ſerve for ſecreſie, to ſeek out Vaults under ground, where they may worſhip God. And yet not even in the moſt ſecret and retired places, without fear of their enemies, and danger of their lives: which ſhews our happineſs in this regard, above theirs, who were much better than we.</p>
               <p>There is but one ſcruple, that I can imagine, remaining: and that is, tho theſe places were private, yet they might be, as <hi>Mede</hi> terms them, <hi>appropriate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer, that his firſt Argument for his Opinion, which immediatly follows, from their worſhipping towards
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62137:20"/>the Eaſt, implies that he takes them for Publick, and purpoſely built accordingly for that end. And (2). who ever diligently peruſes his Treatiſe, will ſee that he founds their <hi>appropriation</hi> (as alſo their holineſs, of which in the next <hi>Diſſertation</hi>) on their <hi>Conſecration,</hi> (or as he ſometimes calls it <hi>Dedication.</hi>) Now if we conſider when this begun, <hi>Platina in vitis Pontif.</hi> tells us, That <hi>Teleſphorus</hi> having ſuffer'd Martyrdom, in the firſt year of <hi>Antomus Pius</hi> (which was about the year of our Lord 142.) <hi>Hyginus</hi> an <hi>Athenian</hi> ſucceeded him. Who ordained theſe two things. Firſt the uſe of thoſe Witneſſes we common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly call Godfathers and Godmothers, in the Adminiſtration of the Sacrament of Baptiſm. Which was then, I confeſs, more neceſſary, by reaſon the generallity of thoſe amongſt whom the Chriſtians lived, were Heathens. And therefore in caſe the Parents, on whom it is incumbent to ſee thei Children edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in the Chriſtian Religion, came to die; they that were Sponſors, might take care to ſee them brought up therein. Which Inſtitution (as likewiſe Confirmation) is now degenerated into a meer Formality: few regarding their ſolemn Engagements made for that end. And (2.) he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained alſo <hi>Templorum conſecrationes; the Conſecration of Temples,</hi> that or Churches, being the uſual Names, given to all places for Gods Worſhip, in after Ages. So that <hi>Conſecration</hi> being but introduced in the ſecond Century; if <hi>Mede</hi> takes it in the uſual ſenſe; his Opinion that <hi>There were appropriate Places for Chriſtian Worſhip both in the Apoſtles days, and ever ſince,</hi> falls to the Ground; except it can be proved, that ſome of them at leaſt, lived ſo long.</p>
               <p>But if he takes it for a private Houſe, or ſome room there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, where the Church met together, as he ſeems in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and by the expreſſions of <hi>the Church in their Houſe:</hi> then whenſoever any Owners thereof, gave leave for the Chriſtians to aſſemble therein, their <hi>permiſſion</hi> was a <hi>Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> thereof, whereby they appropriated the ſame to the Churches uſe; and ſo, according to his Tenets, employed them no more for their own Civil uſe, being appropriate to a Sacred. Or elſe ſome pious Chriſtians, gave their Houſes, as he thinks, and dedicated them to the Church for a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Place, by which Dedication it was appropriated. But neither of theſe can be reaſonably imagined. Conſidering
<list>
                     <item>(1.) That we read of ſeveral that ſold their Poſſeſſions, for the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62137:20"/>Maintenance of the Poor: but we read of none that gave their Houſes to the Church for meeting in.</item>
                     <item>(2.) The multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Chriſtians increaſing, many Houſes were requiſite to contain them, as we have formerly obſerved.</item>
                     <item>(3.) How often in thoſe bloody Perſecutious, they were forced to ſhift their Meeting-Places, to ſhun the loſs of their Eſtates, Liberties and Lives, we may eaſily conclude.</item>
                     <item>And laſtly, Had any either granted, or given any Houſe, or certain place, for ſuch an uſe, as therein conſtantly to aſſemble: they had thereby, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt, been quickly diſcovered, certainly diſperſed, and often times moſt ſeverely puniſh'd. So that tho we are not to queſtion the readineſs of many that were able, nor their pious liberality: ſo we muſt alſo conſider their Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the times wherein they lived, and what was moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible to their preſervation, that they might not run them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the rocks of deſtruction.</item>

               <p>Our Opponents beſides the Authorities mentioned, produce ſeveral Arguments for their Opinion; whereof 3 are made uſe of by <hi>Mede,</hi> which we ſhall now conſider.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>It's certain,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>That in their Sacred Aſſemblies, Chriſtians uſed then to Worſhip and Pray towards the Eaſt.</hi> Which how it could be done, with any order and conveniency, is not eaſie to be conceived; unleſs we ſuppoſe the places, wherein they worſhipped to have been ſituated and accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated accordingly, that is choſen and appointed to that end. This he had touched on before, from <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the 3d Century; for which no authority is vouched, but <hi>that only</hi> of the forged <hi>Apſtolical Conſtitutions,</hi> falſly aſcribed to <hi>Clemens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here let me obſerve, whereas <hi>Mede</hi> ſaith <hi>to worſhip and pray, Bellarmine c.</hi> 3 <hi>de cultu ſanct.</hi> rightly reſtrains to prayers only, and thoſe made publickly in the Temples. For having menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned ſeveral Authors for this, adds, <hi>Et omnes illi Veteres, qui ſcribunt Apoſtolicam eſſe traditionem, ut oremus converſi ad Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem; id praecipue ſervari par eſt, in ſolemnibus precibus, quae fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duntur in Templis: And all thoſe Ancients which write, that 'tis an Apoſtolical Tradition, that we pray turned towards the Eaſt:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62137:21"/>that ought eſpecially to be obſerved in the ſolemn Prayers, which are made in Temples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Tho we grant this an ancient Cuſtom; yet is it without Command, or Example in the Scriptures; for Chriſt never required it, nor was it practiſed from the beginning of Chriſtianity. Where's the Proof they <hi>then</hi> uſed ſo to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? Or when this Cuſtom firſt came up? For as to the <hi>Conſtitutions,</hi> rightlier to be called <hi>Apocryphal</hi> than <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> (as we have formerly obſerved) they deſerve no Credit at all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If this neceſſarily implies Edifices ſo ſituated, which I queſtion, and he ſuppoſes, (but hath not proved) then thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>upper rooms,</hi> the <hi>coenaculum Sionis,</hi> that <hi>upper room in Sion,</hi> and <hi>private Houſes,</hi> which were the firſt Churches, he grants in the beginning of his Treatiſe, were all ſo ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, which I hardly think, he himſelf thought. And much leſs that the Coemeteries and Vaults under Ground, which ſo many Authors mention for their Meeting Places (as we ſhall ſhew hereafter) were ſo: or had ſuch Light Eaſtward, more than from other Quarters of the Heavens.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> there treating of the Form of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches, ſaith only, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t plurimum eas ad Orientem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſas fuiſſe, &amp; quatuor latera habuiſſe quibus quatuor Mundi partes aſpicerent. That for the moſt part they were turned towards the Eaſt, and had four ſides, turned towards the four parts of the World.</hi> Likewiſe <hi>Walfridus Strabo de rebus Eccleſ.</hi> c. 4. ſaith, <hi>Majorem partem Eccleſiarum ita fabricari; That the greater part of Churches were ſo made.</hi> So that by their ſaying, all were not ſo; ſome might be round, as we have an ancient Church in <hi>Cambridge</hi> ſo built, which ſome ſay, was the uſual Form of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Synagogues, ſuch as the leſſer, at <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> And ſome ſited otherwiſe than Eaſtward, as the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> as <hi>Socrates l.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 21. teſtifies. And if they were oblong, and ſtood Eaſt and Weſt, ſeeing they had four ſides, 'tis meant doubtleſs of the Chancel, which was Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Of which diſtinction in Churches; when firſt it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, or who was the Author thereof, is not ſet down by any Writers I have met with. Tho we know, in <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>'s time, when ſtately Churches were erected, this was uſed. And if we take this in the firſt Ages, for private pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, frequently ſtiled <hi>Oratories</hi> and <hi>Chappels,</hi> ſuch as were in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62137:21"/>Houſes and Vaults under Ground, or above in the open Air; to ſay their aſpect was Eaſtward, is to beg the queſtion, and cannot be proved. We may well imagine, thoſe built, were rather according to the conveniency of the place, or pleaſure of the Founders. As the Chappels of <hi>Emanuel</hi> and <hi>Sidney</hi> College in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> which ſtood rather North and South. Tho the former hath now a new one built in Mode and Figure; and is no more to be derided, as formerly, by <hi>Cart-wright,</hi> an <hi>Oxford</hi> Poet:
<q>
                     <l>Much like the Chappel Ominous,</l>
                     <l>Of 'th Colledge called God with us.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Nor the other now in danger to be demoliſhed, as Mr. <hi>Mathews,</hi> an ancient Fellow thereof, told me, was in the days of A. B. <hi>Land,</hi> threatned therewith.</p>
               <p>I confeſs <hi>Bellarmine</hi> brings ſeveral Authors for this ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Churches; but none that proves there was always ſuch, nor that they were all ſuch; as alſo for the Ceremony of praying towards the Eaſt, for which he produces 5 reaſons, (ſuch as they are) I ſhall briefly repreſent them, to ſhew the ſorry grounds of this practice, which takes away the liberty Chriſt hath left us, to advance a Cuſtom of humane Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe Paradiſe was in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and we being here but ſtrangers, ſhould labour to regain our ancient Country, which we were caſt out of. Which is produced by ſeveral other <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as the Opinion of the Fathers, and lately by the Learned <hi>Huetius c.</hi> 3. <hi>de ſitu Paradiſi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As if Paradiſe, where ever it was (the place thereof having puzzl'd ſo many Learned Inquiſitors) whether in or near <hi>Meſopotamia,</hi> or elſewhere, was not as well Weſt to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians beyond it, as Eaſt to us on this ſide. Or that we were to look after a Terreſtial Paradiſe, more than a Coeleſtial, whereof that was but a Type. And as the Saints in the Old Teſtament lookt from all parts toward the Temple, as a Type of our bleſſed Saviour; ſo under the New, we are directed to look towards Heaven, as the Habitation of our Heavenly Father, where Chriſt ſits at his right hand to make Interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for us.</p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:62137:22"/>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Sun riſing there, 'tis the moſt excellent part of the World.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing its motion, doth it not continually ariſe in the ſeveral Horizons, to thoſe of the ſame Latitude throughout the World and there ſet to their <hi>Antipodes?</hi> ſo that the Eaſt of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as <hi>Gregory</hi> explains it, muſt needs be Weſt, to the further parts of the World. And how can that be moſt excellent to any, which is equally alike to all?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe Chriſt whom we Worſhip, is the <hi>light of the world, Vir Oriens, the Man of the Eaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Its true that as the bleſſed God, is called <hi>light,</hi> which of all creatures is the moſt pure: So Chriſt is called, <hi>the Sun of righteouſneſs, the light of the world, and the day ſpring from on high</hi> &amp;c. But this is only metaphorically, in regard of his illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us, and not at all to the place of Eaſt or Weſt, North or South, all being equally alike to him for that end.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Becauſe Chriſt was crucified with his Face Weſtward, ſo that we look Eaſtward to behold his countenance. And he aſcended towards the Eaſt, and from thence ſhall come to Judgment.</p>
               <p>But where's the proof of that poſture in his Crucificti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Not in the Scripture ſure. And how ſhould the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans beyond <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> pray towards his Face ſo, who lived in <hi>Perſia,</hi> and other Eaſtern Countries. <hi>Math.</hi> 24.27. is meant of his Goſpel Diſpenſation, or his ſpeedy coming to deſtroy <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as <hi>Hammond</hi> and <hi>Lightfoot</hi> think; or by that Emblem to Judgment: the point of Eaſt in the Heavens, being no where ſo to all the World he is to Judge.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Becauſe the <hi>Jews</hi> prayed, and pray towards the Weſt, we towards the Eaſt; to ſignifie theirs to be the killing Letter, and ours the Vivificating Spirit, and that the Veil ſtill remains over their hearts, which we converted unto the Lord, have laide aſide.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Jews</hi> at the Temple looked Weſtward, was becauſe the Mercy-Seat, in the moſt holy Place was at the Weſt end thereof. But that they do ſo ſtill, as <hi>Gregory</hi> alſo ſaith, I think is a miſtake; I never obſerved it in any of their Synagogues, tho I have ſeen ſeveral, and their Worſhip: yet I never ſaw any People ſo regardleſs therein as the preſent Generation of the <hi>Jews.</hi> But why may we not pray in the ſame poſture with the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, which were Gods People, and had his direction? as
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62137:22"/>well as in the poſture of thoſe Gentile Idolaters that worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Sun (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 8.16.) as the <hi>Perſians</hi> and many other Nations? Truly if you will believe the Cardinal, becauſe this poſture ſignifies ſo much more excellent things than the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh,</hi> which he there mentions; even the difference between the Goſpel and Chriſtianity, from the preſent Religion of the accurſed <hi>Jews,</hi> the Enemies of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Here recommend me to the man that hath ſo ſtrong Faith, as to believe a bare poſture can denote ſuch great things, to which it hath no tendency, or likeneſs at all.</p>
               <p>But if any one hath liſt and leiſure, to ſee a deal of dry Learning thrown away on this ſubject of praying towards the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> they may peruſe the 18th <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Notes on <hi>Zachary</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 12. Who had written alſo a Treatiſe, he intituled <hi>Alkibla (i. e.</hi> the place toward which men worſhip) as the Publiſher of his poſthumous Works acquaints us: the loſs whereof he laments, tho for my part, I think it not great.</p>
               <p>Before I paſs to another Argument, let me ſet down the Opinion of <hi>Strabo</hi> in the place fore-mentioned; (an Author near 800 Years old, when Ceremonies and Superſtition were in Vogue, and near their Altitude) concerning the ſite of Churches Eaſtward. <hi>Et quia diverſitas Idololatriae, diverſis mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis Templa extruxerat: non magnopere curabant illius temporis juſti, quam in partem orationis loca converterent, dum tantum vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deretur, ubi eliminatae ſunt Daemonum ſordes, ibi Deum creatorem omnium, qui ubique eſt, coli &amp; adorari. And becauſe Temples were built after divers manners, according to the different ways of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry: The righteous men of thoſe days, did not much care which way the places of Prayer ſtood; their conſideration being only this, that look where the filth and abomination of Devils were caſt out of Doors, there God the Creator of all, who is every where, might be worſhipped and adored.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that by the righteous men of thoſe times, which cared not which way they converted their places, or ſelves in Prayer to God, were the times of the Converſion of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire from Idolatry to Chriſtianity, is plain by what preceds, <hi>c.</hi> 3. where he ſaith, <hi>After the time was come, wherein the true Worſhippers in Spirit and Truth, not in</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>only, or in the Hill of</hi> Samaria, <hi>that is not locally but ſpiritually, began to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Father, and the Doctrine of Salvation went forth into all
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62137:23"/>Nations, according to the commandment of the Lord, the Faithful began to ſeek</hi> loca munda, <hi>clean places</hi> (which he interprets by that which follows) <hi>and removed from tumults and affairs of men of carnal converſation, therein to celebrate pure Prayers, and the holy Myſteries, and the comforts of mutual edification. For tho we read in the Goſpel, the Diſciples were with the Believers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in the Temple, or in ſome upper room, praiſing God, and giving themſelves to Faſting and Prayer; yet after the coming down of the Holy Ghoſt upon them. we read</hi> Act 1. &amp; 2d chap. <hi>that they Celebrated Prayers and the Euchariſt</hi> circa domos, <hi>from houſe to houſe: and they met together not only within the City, in ſome houſe or other, but without alſo in ſecret places, as at</hi> Philippi. Acts 16.13. <hi>But when the number of Believers was multiplied, they began to make their Houſes, Churches, as we often read in the Legends of the Saints. Oftentimes alſo declining the rage of Perſecutors, they had their meetings in Vaults under ground, and in places of Burial, and in Caves, and deſert Mountains and Valleys. Then as the Miracle of Chriſtian Religion profited more and more; and the Devil looſing ground, as Chriſt gained: New Oratories were built; nor ſo only, but alſo the Temples of their Gods and Idols, with the abominable Worſhip thereof, being thrown away and baniſhed, were changed into the Churches of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It's true, that he diſlikes not praying towards the Eaſt, but gives reaſons for the congruity of it; yet upon conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that the Holy of Holies was Weſtward, and that <hi>Solomon</hi> in's Prayer at the Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, turned his Face that way, he concludes, <hi>His &amp; aliis exemplis edocti, cognoſcimus, non erraſſe illos, vel errare, qui Templis vel noviter Deo conſtructis, vel ab Idolorum ſqualore mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datis, propter aliquam locorum opportunitatem, in diverſas plagas altaria ſtatuerunt; quia non eſt locus, ubi non ſit Deus. By theſe and other Examples, we learn that they who either in Temples now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly built for God, or purged from the filthineſs of Idols, did accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the opportunity of places, ſet Altars towards different Coaſts, did nothing</hi> erre, <hi>ſeeing there is no place where God is not preſent.</hi> And accordingly proceeds to ſhew, that in the Temple built by <hi>Helena</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> upon Chriſt's Sepulcher; and in the Pantheon at <hi>Rome,</hi> converted to Chriſtian uſe; as alſo, in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church there, Altars were Erected, not only towards the Eaſt, but alſo, other Quarters of the Heavens. And adds, <hi>Haec cum ſecundum voluntatem, vel neceſſitatem fuerint ita diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſita,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62137:23"/>improbare non audemus.</hi> So that tho he approves rather, of praying towards the Eaſt; yet profeſſeth, <hi>he dares not blame thoſe, who otherwiſe ordered the matter, and that not only in caſe of neceſſity, but of meer will and pleaſure.</hi> Concluding thus, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nusquiſque in ſuo ſenſu abundet, propè eſt Dominus omnibus, invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantibus eum in veritate. Let every one abound in his own ſenſe, the Lord is near to all that call upon him in Truth.</hi> I muſt add to all theſe, the Example of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Liturgy, Miniſters Prayers, and Peoples practice; and further ſhew, that tho <hi>Mede</hi> joins the poſition of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and Prayers; yet neither of theſe neceſſarily infer the other; but I have run out too far on this Argument already.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is drawn from the Diſcipline of the Church, which required diſtinct and regular places in their Aſſemblies, for Penitents, Auditors, Catechumens and the Faithful; which argues, they had places accommodated for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>We had this Argument before, in the middle of the Third Century, where we anſwered the ſame; and therefore ſhall be briefer here.</p>
               <p>Where I ſhall not inſiſt upon it, That diſtinctions might be made in private Houſes or Places; tho not ſo well or great as in publick Churches. Nor deny the authority of that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure Epiſtle; however called Canonical, of <hi>Gregorius Neocae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarienſis,</hi> which was a little before alledged for this Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and alſo conſidered. But roundly anſwer, that no ſuch diſtinction of places can be proved in the days of the Apoſtles, or an hundred years after. It's therefore a ſtrange inference, that if there were ſuch different places, for the ſeveral ſorts of Church Members, in <hi>Gregory</hi>'s time; which was about 250 years after the Nativity of our bleſſed Saviour; that there were ſuch in the Apoſtles days, and ever ſince; as our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries would perſwade us. But they muſt have ſtronger reaſons than theſe, before they gain our aſſent. For who ſeeth not, that ſuch diſtinction of places is more ſit for times of Peace than Perſecution (ſuch as were moſtly the firſt 300 years of Chriſtianity) wherein men muſt be content to do as they may, and can, ſeeing they cannot do as they deſire.</p>
               <p>The Third Argument is drawn from the Example of the Synagogues and Proſeucha's of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe Religion was as contrary to the Empires, as the Chriſtians, and yet in their diſperſion amongſt the Gentiles, had appropriate places for
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62137:24"/>the exerciſe thereof. Who can believe that ſuch a Pattern ſhould not invite the Chriſtians to an imitation of the ſame, tho we ſhould ſuppoſe there were no other reaſons to induce them, but that of ordinary conveniency.</p>
               <p>This Reaſon ſuppoſes the Chriſtians might do, as the <hi>Jews,</hi> who built them Synagogues in thoſe Cities where they reſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; having a legal Tolleration for the exerciſe of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; whereas the Laws of the Empire were againſt the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Which makes me wonder ſuch Learned Men, as <hi>Fuller, Mede</hi> and others, that could not but know ſo much; ſhould produce this Plea for their Opinion. Juſt as if they ſhould argue, The <hi>Jews</hi> in many <hi>Popiſh</hi> Countries, build and enjoy their Synagogues, whoſe Religion is more contrary to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery</hi> than the <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> and therefore the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> ſhould follow their Example, and build themſelves Churches for their publick Worſhip. To which the anſwer is eaſie; that ſo they would if they had the like Tolleration. But to what purpoſe ſhould they build up that which the Magiſtrates would throw down, and they ſhould never enjoy, but inſtead thereof be more perſecuted and puniſht. Whence in ſeveral great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, where there are ſome <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> Miniſters are ſent them, which they call, <hi>ſub Cruce,</hi> or <hi>under the Croſs of Perſecution,</hi> as the Learned Profeſſor <hi>Hornbeck</hi> was in his younger years in <hi>Collen,</hi> (where I have ſeen the <hi>Jews</hi> Synagogue) and others I have known at <hi>Ghent,</hi> and elſewhere, <hi>incognito,</hi> or diſguis'd, exerciſing their Office with great ſecreſie, for their greater ſecurity. Not to mention the Perſecutions the Chriſtians were under in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, when the <hi>Jews</hi> enjoyed the Liberty of their Religion: having ſpoken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thereof in the ſecond <hi>Section,</hi> and ſhall more fully in the following.</p>
               <p>Nor let any one ſtop me, with objecting the many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of <hi>Jews</hi> under <hi>Caligula</hi> and <hi>Claudius</hi> Reigns, for their Tumults and Inſurrections: or the Wars in the Reigns of <hi>Nero</hi> and <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> wherein eleven hundred thouſand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> taken and demoliſhed, with the Temple burnt. Nor after under <hi>Aelius Adrianus,</hi> about <hi>A. D.</hi> 130. who tho he built <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> calling it <hi>Aelia</hi> by his fore-name, (as he did <hi>Adrianople</hi> by his other) yet made miſerable Havock of the <hi>Jews</hi> and their Country. For this was not by Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but by open Wars with them for 6 Years together, which
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62137:24"/>they brought upon themſelves. The occaſion is ſaid to be, <hi>quod mutilare genitalia vetarentur, arma corripuerant; that being forbidden Circumciſion, they took up Arms.</hi> Inſtead of humbly addreſſing for a revocation, they betake themſelves to War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Oppoſition; being alſo ſet agog by <hi>Bencochab,</hi> who gave himſelf out for their Meſſias. In which Wars this their falſe Meſſias was ſlain; and more Thouſands of the <hi>Jews,</hi> than the number of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as their Rabbins report; or as our Hiſtorians, five hundred thouſand, and a thouſand of their Villages burnt down to the Ground.</p>

               <p>Having now Anſwered their Reaſons, We ſhall proceed to lay down ſeveral Conſiderations for the corroborating our Aſſertion. Which amount not to a Demonſtration, I confeſs, That there could be no publick Places erected, for the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> in the two Firſt Centuries; yet compared with our Adverſaries Arguments, will render our Cauſe much more probable, and weigh down theirs ſo clearly, as to ſatisfie all unprejudiced Readers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let's conſider the State and Condition of the World as to Religion, when our bleſſed Saviour, after his Reſurrection, ſent forth his Apoſtles to Preach the Goſpel to all Nations. In which were two ſorts of Men, <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> of whom 'tis hard to ſay, whether were the more implacable Enemies to the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and the Profeſſors thereof.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Jews,</hi> what Calumnies and Tumults did they raiſe againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> not only in <hi>Judea,</hi> but whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they reſided; accuſing their Doctrine as Blaſphemous, their Perſons as Factious and Seditious, and ſetting up a new King inſtead of <hi>Caeſar.</hi> And where they had no power to Perſecute them, they ſtirred up the Magiſtrates in the Empire to do it, as we find frequently in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> what Ignorance, Wickedneſs, and abominable Idolatries they lived in, Scripture hath abundantly declared. <hi>God having in times paſt ſuffered</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>all the Gentiles,</hi> rather than as we Tranſlate it, all Nations, to <hi>walk in their own ways.</hi> Acts 14.16. For the <hi>Jews</hi> had the way of Salvation made known to them; but the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ways were in groſs Idolatry, ſetting up to themſelves multiplicity of Gods,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62137:25"/>whom they worſhipped and ſerved; although ſome of the wiſer ſort of them held one Supream, whom they called <hi>Jove,</hi> contracted from <hi>Jehova,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Father both of Men and Gods. And this their Idolatrous Worſhip and Religion was ſo ancient, even from Time immemorial, and ſo univerſal in all the Nations of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> that none can imagine but the Goſpel, which oppoſed and condemned this wherever it came, ſhould have the utmoſt Oppoſition, and its Publiſhers and Profeſſors Perſecutions, rather than a Toleration or Permiſſion to ſet up a Religion in publick, deſtructive of their own.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider the Power of the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, which was then at the height; having Conquered the greateſt part of the Weſtern Nations, both in <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> and Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as far as <hi>Euphrates,</hi> in which eſpecially the Goſpel was to be Preached, though it was carried alſo into the remoter Parts elſewhere, over which the <hi>Roman</hi> Eagle never ſtretcht her Wings. In the City of <hi>Rome, Tacitus</hi> Reports, <hi>Hiſt. l.</hi> 11. there were not fewer than 6944000. and what vaſt Nations were then ſubject to its Empire, is ſufficiently known; and what numerous Armies they conſtantly kept up. All which Power was Unanimous for the defence of their Idols, and their Idolatrous Worſhip, againſt all Men and Means that would defame them, or tended to their Demolition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider alſo, That at that time there was not only the greateſt Power to oppoſe <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> but alſo the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual Helps and Means, Learning being then in its full Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian of Glory. They had ſubtle Philoſophers for defending their Religion, and as good Arguments for its Verity, as <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> and the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> alledge for theirs, ſuch as Antiquity, Univerſality, Extent, Succeſſion of their Prieſts, Proſperity, and the like. They had Eloquent Orators to Plead their own, and Implead, <hi>Tertullus</hi> like, the <hi>Chriſtian Religion;</hi> beſides the vaſt multitude of Prieſts, and thoſe imployed for the training them up in their Idolatrous Worſhip, whereby they became prejudiced to the utmoſt againſt the Goſpel of Chriſt, eſpecially conſidering the nature and tendency thereof, either as to the <hi>Credenda</hi> or <hi>Agenda,</hi> things to be Believed or Practiſed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned therein.</p>
               <p>For Sinners to be Saved by a Crucified Jeſus, might well to the Carnal and Unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> be a ſtumbling
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62137:25"/>Block, and accounted Fooliſhneſs; as the Reſurrection of the Dead, and other Articles of our Faith, ſtrange Doctrines: And things ſo contrary to Fleſh and Blood, as Self-denial, Mortification, Suffering joyfully Perſecution, and even Death it ſelf for Chriſt's ſake and the Goſpel, might well be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted hard Sayings not to be born, but rather derided and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, as indeed they were generally by the wiſe Men of the World.</p>
               <p>Nor let any here object <hi>Mahometiſm,</hi> for that was ſet up when the Empire was broken to pieces under <hi>Heraclius,</hi> by the Irruption of the Barbarous Nations; and in <hi>Arabia,</hi> amongſt an ignorant People, where few <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were, and no Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but ready to embrace any Innovations, and receive any Impreſſions of Religion, eſpecially ſuch a Senſual one as the <hi>Alcoran</hi> holds forth; when there were neither Men of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Parts to oppoſe it, nor Princes of Power to perſecute it, but worldly Power to ſet it up and ſupport it. So that 'tis leſs wonder that ſoon grew publick: Whereas it was quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe with the Goſpel, which was neither ſet up, nor car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on, by Might and Power of Arms, but by the Spirit of the Lord accompanying it all along, where it was carried, to make it Efficacious.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider how ſtrongly <hi>Gentiliſm</hi> was guarded by Laws. For all Nations, though they had ſeveral Idol Gods, and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, yet accounted their Religion to be of a Divine Original: As the <hi>Romans</hi> from the Goddeſs <hi>Egeria,</hi> and others from ſome God or Goddeſs they Worſhipped: and would never ſuffer their Gods to be diſhonoured, or their Rites of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, how Ridiculous ſoever, to be defamed by any amongſt them, though Foreigners they could not hinder, did, as the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi> eſpecially. I ſhall not abuſe the <hi>Reader</hi>'s Patience, in citing Hiſtories and Poets for theſe things, they are ſo many, and ſo well known; nor how they always provided by their Laws, Security for their own, and Prohibition and Penalties againſt other Religions. The <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> by the Laws of the 12 Tables, forbad
<q>Nequis alios inducat Deos, ſed Patriam ſive Romanam Religionem ſequatur.</q>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:62137:26"/>
                  <hi>That none ſhould introduce other Gods, but follow the Country's, or</hi> Roman <hi>Religion, and that under ſevere Penalties.</hi> Of which <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero,</hi> l. 2. <hi>de Legibus</hi> largely. By vertue of which Laws alone, many <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were extreamly puniſh'd by the Praetors, and Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of Provinces, and put to Death, without any Edicts from the Emperors; though where theſe were added to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force their Execution, Perſecution was much more fierce and cruel: And this appears plainly by <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Epiſtle to <hi>Trajan;</hi> who having Condemned and Executed many by the Laws of the Empire, deterr'd at length by the multitude of thoſe that were to be puniſhed, Conſulted the Emperor what he ſhould do in that caſe, the Emperors having power to Suſpend Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, though not to Abrogate the Laws, which <hi>Senatus Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puluſ<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> &amp; Principes Romani decreverant ut non ſint Chriſtiani: The</hi> Roman <hi>Senate, People and Princes had decreed,</hi> as that <hi>no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians be tollerated.</hi> Another early Law made by the Senate, mention'd by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> 5.21. <hi>Non debere demitti Chriſtianos qui ſemel ad Tribunal veniſſent, niſi propoſitum mutent: That the Chriſtians which once came to publick Tryal, ſhould not be diſmiſt, except they changed their Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſider the Policy of the State, which was againſt Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerating any diverſe Religion amongſt them, and much more a contrary to their own. As the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> which wholly changed the Face of the World, accounted their Deities Idols, and their Devotion groſs Idolatry; which was therefore judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dangerous for raiſing Tumults and Commotions among the People, which might end in Civil Wars for Religion: So that they Unanimouſly concluded it beſt for the Publick Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to Extirpate <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and the Profeſſors thereof. Yea, ſo Jealous were they, that all Societies, or Conventions, were forbidden, as appears by 42. &amp; 43. <hi>Epiſt. Plinij, l.</hi> 10. And much more of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> as <hi>Ep.</hi> 98. Acquaints <hi>Trajan,</hi> How the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> forbore <hi>poſt edictum meum, quo ſecundum mandata tua hetaerias eſſe vetueram: After my Edict, whereby I forbad, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your Command; all Conventions of Societies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Conſideration of State-Policy, hath been the great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument and Engine in all Ages for Perſecution; inſomuch, that ſome Chriſtian Writers of Politicks, upon this account, juſtifie the <hi>Heathens,</hi> and <hi>Popiſh Inquiſition;</hi> though S. <hi>James</hi> calls this <hi>Wiſdom earthly, ſenſual, devilliſh,</hi> quite contrary to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62137:26"/>that from above, which is, <hi>firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle and eaſie to be intreated, full of mercy,</hi> &amp;c. And oh! that it had not prevail'd amongſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to the great Scandal of the <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> and his peaceable Goſpel, which they profeſs! It was far more tollerable in the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who had only the Light of Nature for their Guide; as the <hi>Romans,</hi> who yet tollerated the Nations they Conquered, to retain their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, not only <hi>Gentiliſm,</hi> but <hi>Judaiſm</hi> alſo, both in <hi>Judea,</hi> and in their diſperſion in the <hi>Roman</hi> Territories: the <hi>Jews</hi> having before ſubmitted to the <hi>Roman</hi> Government, and become their Tributaries, when Subdued by <hi>Pompey.</hi> By reaſon whereof, the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> coming from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and paſſing in the Empire, a while at the firſt for <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe Synagogues they uſed then to frequent, paſſed undiſcerned, without Perſecution; 'till after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that they were diſcovered, and then both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> became their implacable Enemies, thoſe frequently ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up theſe (as we read in the <hi>Acts</hi>) to Perſecute them. For they both accounted them ſetters up of a ſtrange God and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, in their worſhipping Chriſt, whom they both took for a meer Man, whom their Anceſtors had Crucified; and that the Goſpel tended to overturn both their Religions, and ways of Worſhip; which will yet more evidently appear, by that which in the next place follows.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Conſider the many and grievous falſe Accuſations brought againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which greatly incenſed all ſorts of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt them. They were accuſed of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Impiety, as killing and eating Children, Inceſt, and impure Mixtures, Magick, and every Evil almoſt that might render them odious, which may be read in the Primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> in their Apologies for <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> ſummarily mentioned in <hi>Spencer</hi>'s <hi>Annotations</hi> on the Firſt Book of <hi>Origen.</hi> So that the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> for their Impiety, were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the Cauſe of all thoſe publick Calamities that befel the Empire. If there was a Famine, Peſtilence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cryed out <hi>Chriſtianos ad Leones, caſt the Chriſtians to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> as <hi>Tertul. Apol.</hi> c. 40. <hi>Cypr. Ep.</hi> 75. and others. So when <hi>Rome</hi> was taken by <hi>Alaricus,</hi> it was imputed to the Anger of the Gods, for the contempt of their Religion; which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to write that excellent Book <hi>de civitate Dei,</hi> and <hi>Oroſius</hi> his <hi>Orcheſtra,</hi> for the Refutation of their Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Folly, which was ſo great, that they ſtill thought to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62137:27"/>the Anger of their Gods, with the Blood of the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor were they leſs traduced for being Enemies to the State, and ſuch as turned the World upſide down; notwithſtanding all their peaceable Demeanour under the Civil Government; becauſe they would not Pray to their Idols (though they did to Almighty God) nor offer Sacrifices to them for the Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity thereof.</p>
               <p>In like manner alſo were they Accuſed, for being Rebels to their Emperors; becauſe they refuſed to frequent their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Feaſts and Spectacles for their Victories; nor would Swear, as others did, by their <hi>Genius;</hi> nor give them Divine Honours, by offering Sacrifices to them, together with their Idol Gods. For as <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> as <hi>Suetonius</hi> tells us in his Life, <hi>c.</hi> 76. <hi>Decerni ſibi paſſus eſt, Templa, Aras, ſimulachra, juxta Deos: Suffered Temples, Altars and Images, to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed for him near the Gods.</hi> So his Heathen Succeſſors in the Empire continued the ſame, as may be ſeen in <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Epiſtle to <hi>Trajan.</hi> Hence they were called <hi>Sacrilgi, Sacriligious,</hi> and <hi>Lawleſs,</hi> becauſe this Worſhip of the Gods and <hi>Caeſar,</hi> was by Law Eſtabliſhed: Yea, the Enemies of Mankind, becauſe by their Contempt of the Gods, they brought Miſeries upon the World.</p>
               <p>So that being accounted by the Heathens Enemies of their <hi>Gods,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> their <hi>State, Emperors, Laws, Manners,</hi> and all <hi>Mankind:</hi> No wonder if they became the object of publick Hatred, according to that of <hi>Tertul. l. Scorp. c.</hi> 11. <hi>Odio habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur ab omnibus hominibus nominis cauſa. We are hated of all Men for the Name of Chriſtians, and his, and</hi> Athenagoras, <hi>and</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin, likewiſe in their Apologies, as our Saviour had foretold, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.22. So 24.9. and <hi>Luke</hi> 21.12.</p>
               <p>And it had been happy for after Ages, ſince the World turn'd <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> if theſe Calumnies had not been uſed, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the beſt ſort of Men, as Enemies to Princes and States, who could not in Conſcience comply to worſhip the Image they ſet up. How have not only <hi>Papiſts</hi> under ſuch Pretexts, all along Perſecuted all that would not ſubmit to their impious Impoſitions, but even <hi>Proteſtants</hi> alſo, frequently for ſmall Matters, all ſuch as refuſed to Dance after the Fidle of the Times.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Let us further conſider the Temporal Intereſt of moſt, which carries all before it, with thoſe that regard not their
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62137:27"/>Spiritual and Eternal: The whole World turning continually upon the Hinge of Self-Intereſt. And herein the vaſt number of thoſe ingaged thereby againſt the Chriſtians; ſome for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Dignities and Revenues they had, and others for Augmenting them.</p>
               <p>Of the former ſort were the ſeveral Religious Orders of Prieſts, or Flamines, and Augurs or Prognoſticators, with the whole Rabble that depended on them. Which muſt needs be many, conſidering the multitude of Places and People, as alſo of Idols and Temples they were to ſerve, by performing their Religious Functions in Sacrifices, Luſtrations and Supplications. All which had great Credit, as in all Religions ſuch have, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially amongſt an Ignorant and Superſtitious People. And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood very well, that Chriſtianity, would ruine at once all their Offices, Honours, and Profit. Knowing that thereby their Gods would be derided, their Worſhip neglected, their Oracles remaining contemned, and proved often falſe; many of them being already ſilenced; which the learned <hi>Plutarch</hi> both confeſt and wondred at in's Book <hi>de defectu Oraculorum,</hi> amongſt his Works, and with <hi>Camararius</hi>'s Notes alone. Which Conſideration ſtopt two of the Heathen Emperours, which had moſt kindneſs for Chriſt, if we may believe <hi>Lampridius</hi> in the Life of <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> who writes thus. <hi>Chriſto</hi> (Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) <hi>Templum facere voluit, eumque inter Deos recipere. Quod et</hi> Adrianus <hi>cogitaſſe fertur, qui Templa in omnibus Civitatibus ſine ſimulachris juſſer at fieri: Quoe hodie idcirco, quia non habent nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina, dicuntur</hi> Adriani, <hi>quae ille ad hoc paraſſe diccbatur: Sed prohibitus eſt ab iis, qui conſulentes ſacra, repererant omnes Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianos futuros, ſi id optata eveniſſet, &amp; Templa Reliqua deſerenda.</hi> Alexander Severus <hi>would have made a Temple for Chriſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him amongſt the Gods. Which</hi> Adrian, <hi>alſo is ſaid to have determined, who had commanded Temples to be made in all Cities without Images; which therefore ſtill, becauſe they have no Gods, are called</hi> Adrian's; <hi>which He was ſaid to have prepared for this; but was prohibited by thoſe, who conſulting the Oracles, found all would turn Chriſtians, if that had happened well, and all other Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples would be forſaken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of the latter Sort, that were for augmenting their Eſtates, were eſpecially the Magiſtrates, both Supream and Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. For knowing they might gain, by the Execution of the Laws: Thoſe eſpecially that were Superſtitious, Covetous, and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62137:28"/>Cruel, were thereby induced to fly upon the Spoil, by confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating the Eſtates of Chriſtians, <hi>who indured a great fight of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; were made a gazing Stock both by Reproaches and Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and were Companions of them that were ſo uſed, and took joyfully the ſpoiling of their Goods,</hi> Heb. 10.32, 33, 34. and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where their Sufferings are ſet forth, comprizing their Loſſes: Yea, even <hi>Felix</hi> the Governour hoped to have got Mony from poor <hi>Paul</hi> for his Freedom; and communed with him oftner for this End, thinking belike, that his Friends would contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute thereto, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.26. So that Temporal Intereſt inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged all Officers, Sacred and Civil, to prevent and ſuppreſs Chriſtianity, and the Profeſſors thereof.</p>
               <p n="8">8. To all the former Conſiderations, which ſuggeſt ſufficient Reaſons for the Chriſtians to keep themſelves as private as poſſible, we may add ſeveral other Particulars.</p>
               <p>As the vaſt Multitude of their Enemies, whoſe extream pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice againſt Chriſtianity, and inveterate hatred of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, ſtirr'd them up frequently to raiſe Popular Tumults againſt their Perſons, Families, and Societies; as we read in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> and other <hi>Authors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if the People were ſuppreſt by the Magiſtrates from exorbitant Violence, they had always Liberty to accuſe them, and bring them to Tryal. And ſuch was their Malice and Rage, that ſometimes they hurried them by Violence before their Rulers; and ſometimes exhibited Multitudes in the ſame Libel, or Accuſation. Then were they ſtrictly examined, and put to purge themſelves upon Oath. And if they denied, were commanded, for further Proof thereof, not only to Worſhip and Sacrifice to the Idol Gods and Emperours, but alſo to curſe Chriſt. And if they confeſt, were certainly condemned to Puniſhment, which was of ſeveral kinds, moſt uſually Death. Altho no other Crime was alledged or proved then their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity. Their Chriſtian Conſtancy, termed inflexible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, was judged ſufficient ground for their Condemnation. Of which the Primitive Fathers Apologies, and <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Epiſtle to <hi>Trajan,</hi> inform us ſufficiently.</p>
               <p>And if they were brought to a Publick Tryal, where leſs Tumultuouſneſs, and more legal Proceedings were uſed: Yet how little Hopes they could have, of eſcaping the utmoſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities of the Laws againſt them, may be eaſily imagined, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that Tryed them, as well as thoſe that Accuſed them,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62137:28"/>were their implacable Enemies. For when an Accuſation was brought in, the Pretor in <hi>Rome,</hi> and the Proconſul or Supream Governour in the Provinces, having appointed the Time of Tryal, then came and ſate on the Tribunal, and the Judges choſen by Lot (more or fewer, according to the Quality of the Cauſe) ſate on Benches. And all the Favour the Accuſed had, was to Object againſt thoſe he thought good, (as we are wont in <hi>England</hi> of the Juries) which the Accuſer had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Liberty to do; and the number of thoſe rejected being again ſupplied by Lot, the Cauſe was pleaded, and the Judges gave Sentence, by Capital Letters in Tables, A. <hi>abſolvebat, abſolved. C. condemnabat, condemned.</hi> N. L. <hi>non liquet, Its not manifeſt.</hi> As our Juries pronounce, <hi>Guilty,</hi> or <hi>Not Guilty,</hi> or <hi>Ignoramus.</hi> I know the manner of the <hi>Grecians</hi> paſſing Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was otherwiſe, by caſting ſmall ſtones into an Urne, the White and whole ſignifying Abſolution, the Black and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Condemnation. But this only by the by.</p>
               <p>Having thus laid down ſo many Conſiderations, to ſupport our Aſſertion; I ſubmit them to the Judgment of all impartial Readers, if they do not preponderate our Opponents Reaſons for theirs; and proceed in the laſt Place, to produce ſeveral Teſtimonies, for Defence of the Truth we have laid down, and undertaken to prove.</p>

               <list>
                  <item>1.

               </list>
               <p>As to the firſt of theſe, concerning the Perſecution of the Primitive Church, mentioned in the Acts of the Apoſtles; we have ſpoken ſomething already in the ſecond Section; and ſhall therefore proceed to that part of <hi>Nero</hi>'s Reign, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately Succeeds. For St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s coming to <hi>Rome,</hi> about the fifth of that Emperour, and Impriſonment there for the ſpace of two Years, concludes the <hi>Acts.</hi> There he found a flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church, as appears by <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 8. of that admirable Epiſtle he had Written to them, between two and three Years before. Whether Founded by thoſe Strangers of <hi>Rome</hi> that were at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> in the Day of Pentecoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.10. Or by thoſe men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the 16. <hi>Chapter</hi> of his Epiſtle, or joyntly by them all, I determine not: But that it was not by <hi>Peter,</hi> who had not as yet been there, is apparent by the Series of Hiſtory. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his Impriſonment, he wrote ſeveral of his excellent Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as that to the <hi>Galatians</hi> (a People inhabiting <hi>Tanium peſſinunt,</hi> and <hi>Anoyra</hi> in <hi>Aſia</hi>) the <hi>Epheſians, Philippians, Coloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, Philemon,</hi> and as moſt think, even thoſe that were laſt, as that to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and thoſe to <hi>Timothy.</hi> Tho' Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> and others Judge, the firſt to <hi>Timothy</hi> was written in's return to <hi>Rome,</hi> and the ſecond in the Year following. For both, ſome Places of Scripture, and many Ancient Fathers teſtifie, that being releaſed after two Years by <hi>Nero,</hi> he went and Preached the Goſpel, in the <hi>Eaſt, Italy, France,</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> for about four Years, and being apprehended and brought again to <hi>Rome,</hi> was there Beheaded. For <hi>Nero</hi> now inraged at the increaſe of the number of Chriſtians, and the decreaſe of the Worſhippers of the Idol Gods, made that bloody Decree, <hi>Quiſquis Chriſtianum ſe confitetur, tanquam generis humani convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus hoſtis, ſine ulteriore ſui defenſione, capite Plectitor. Whoſoever confeſſeth himſelf to be a Chriſtian, ſhall as thereby a convicted Enemy of Mankind, without any further Defence of himſelf, looſe his Head.</hi> And <hi>Oroſius</hi> l. 7. <hi>c.</hi> 7. <hi>Primus</hi> (Nero) <hi>Romae Chriſtianos ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cits &amp; mortibus affecit; ac per omnes Provincias pari Perſecutione execruciari imperavit; ipſumque nomen extirpari conatus,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Nero was the firſt at</hi> Rome, <hi>that puniſhed the Chriſtians, and put them to Death; and commanded that through all the Provinces, they ſhould be tormented with like Perſecution; and endeavoured to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the very Name of Chriſtians.</hi> Where Note, that tho' all
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62137:29"/>Authors generally make him the firſt Perſecutor of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, it muſt either be underſtood, as firſt of the Emperors; or the firſt general Perſecution, after the Conſtitution of Churches amongſt the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which is uſually reckoned from our Saviours Aſcenſion, the Time of twenty five Years to <hi>Nero.</hi> For that both particular Perſons, and the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> were perſecuted before <hi>Nero</hi>'s Time, is manifeſt in the Acts of the Bleſſed Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>There is a Paſſage in <hi>Tacitus</hi> Annals, <hi>l.</hi> 15. c. 44. tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by <hi>Sulpicius Severus,</hi> l. 2. <hi>Hiſt.</hi> very remarkable, for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity with Scripture, and clearing ſome Places therein.

               <p>Having ſet forth the burning of <hi>Rome,</hi> attributed to <hi>Nero, Abolendo rumori ſubdidit reos, &amp; quaeſitiſſimis paenis affecit, quos per flagitia inviſos, vulgus Chriſtianos appellabat.

The Author of that Name is Chriſt, who in the Reign of</hi> Tiberius, <hi>was executed by his Procon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul</hi> Pontius Pilate. <hi>And this Peſtilent Superſtition having been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed for a Time, broke out again, not only in</hi> Judea, <hi>the Original of that evil, but alſo in the City of</hi> Rome, <hi>whither all heinous and ſhameful things from all parts flow together, and are had in Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Firſt therefore they were apprehended, who confeſſed; then a great multitude of them being diſcovered were convicted in Judgment, not ſo much for the crime of burning the City, as the hatred of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. And mockeries added to their Deaths, they were covered with the Skins of wild Beaſts, that they might be torn in Pieces by Dogs, or Crucified, or Burnt, and when the Day was ſpent, they were uſed for Lights in the Night.</hi> Nero <hi>had offered his Gardens for this Spectacle.</hi>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62137:30"/>by his Governours executing the Laws againſt them is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. For, <hi>Suidas</hi> ſaith, <hi>Tyberianus</hi> the Preſident of <hi>Syria</hi> writ him Word, <hi>Se non eſſe parem Chriſtianis occidendis, eo quod ultro illi ſe neci offerrent. That he was not able, or ſufficient for killing the Chriſtians, becauſe of their own Accord, they offered themſelves to Death.</hi> And <hi>Pliny</hi> his Proconſul in <hi>Bithynia,</hi> after he had put many to Death, affrighted with their Multitude, conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Emperor what was to be done with them, in that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Epiſtle to <hi>Trajan,</hi> l. 10. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 98. (mentioned by <hi>Tertul.</hi> in <hi>Apol. Euſebius</hi> and others) which I ſhall not tranſcribe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in moſt Mens hands. Only let me obſerve, that ſo ſevere was the Perſecution, that many for fear, denied they were Chriſtians, tho' they had been they confeſt, but had forſaken it, ſome of them <hi>ante plures Annos</hi> many Years before; and that after he had forbidden their Societies, according to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors command, they had forborn them; and having faithfully declared, their Manner of Worſhip, and Innocency of Life; yet <hi>Trajan</hi> anſwers him, They ſhould not be ſought after, but Connived at, except they were Accuſed and Convicted, and then if they perſiſted, they ſhould be puniſhed. <hi>Conquirendi non ſunt: Si deferantur, &amp; arguantur, puniendi ſunt,</hi> by which occaſion, ſaith <hi>Euſebius,</hi> l. 3. <hi>Hiſt. c.</hi> 33. <hi>Plurimi ex fidelibus multiplicis Martyrii certamen ſubjerunt. Many of the Chriſtian ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered manifold Martyrdom.</hi> And thus I have gone through the firſt Age, and the Times of all the Apoſtles; St. <hi>John</hi> who out-lived all the reſt, till the third Year of <hi>Trajan</hi> (as <hi>Iraeneus</hi> and <hi>Hierom</hi> affirm) and dyed 100. or more Years of old Age. From what's ſaid, let any impartial Man judge, If in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Times as well as ever ſince, the Chriſtians had ſuch Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for Worſhip, as our Adverſaries contend for.</p>
               <p>I deſign not a Hiſtory, and therefore ſhall not proceed to the General Perſecutions that follows in the Second and Third Century, which together with the former, are generally count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ten (tho' differently reckoned) that they may anſwer the Ten Plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but by ſome Twelve in Number. In regard 'tis needleſs; ſo many having related them at large, <hi>Euſebius</hi> eſpecially, at whoſe Torch moſt after him Light their Candles. And in our own Language, <hi>Fox</hi> in the beginning of his Martyrology. I ſhall only requeſt, the conſidering the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of thoſe general Perſecutions in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; and it will appear, that tho' they were not continual, yet the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62137:31"/>in the firſt Ages had not any long time of Repoſe, tho' ſome lucid Intervals ſometimes, when the Affairs of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire were diſturbed and turbulent, (as is uſual we know by Modern Examples) eſpecially from <hi>Commodus</hi> to <hi>Severus,</hi> and from <hi>Severus</hi> to <hi>Decius.</hi> So that it was the wonderful Work of God, and Power of his Grace, that carried on the Work of the Goſpel, againſt all Oppoſition; and let the World ſee how vain the Attempts of Men were, againſt what Gods Hand and Counſel determined before ſhould come to paſs. As <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tul.</hi> in <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>Apolog. Cruciate, torquete, damnate, atterite nos—. Plures efficimur quoties metimur à vobis. Semen eſt Sanguis Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianorum, Torment, torture, condemn, break us to Pieces. The oftner we are Mowen down by you, the more we are made. The Blood of Chriſtians, is the Seed of the Church.</hi> And becauſe ſome pretend, the good Nature of ſome of the Emperors, and their peaceable Reigns: It is not denied, that ſome were far better, comparatively than others, as <hi>Nerva, Domitians</hi> Succeſſor, who recalled thoſe he had Baniſhed, as <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, with many others, and acquitted the Chriſtians from the Rigour of the Laws. But Alas! this was but a ſhort Breathing Time, he having Reigned but four Months and nine Days above a Year; ſo that it's ſcarce accounted; nor ſome that were longer, no nor any, as the effect of their Clemency, but Reaſon of State, and their being imbarreſt in other Affairs, or imbroiled in Wars. For this we have <hi>Theodoret</hi>'s evident Teſtimony, <hi>Hiſt. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 38. <hi>Quotquot Imperatores ante</hi> Conſtantinum M. <hi>reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narunt, contra Veritatis Profeſſores inſana rabie furere non deſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt. All the Emperors that Reigned before</hi> Conſtantine <hi>the Great, ceaſed not with mad Fury to Rage againſt the Profeſſors of the Truth.</hi> So that we may conclude, there was no truſting to their Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or Favour, further than their Temporal Intereſt, and their own Safety, and Security of the Government were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. And therefore ſmall Opportunity or Incouragement for Chriſtians injoying any publick Places for Worſhip conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, much leſs for Building any ſuch.</p>

               <p>Here occurs an Objection, made againſt the Greatneſs and Cruelty of theſe Perſecutions, by Reaſon of the Paucity of the Martyrs comparatively, with the common Opinion of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62137:31"/>their great Multitudes. Which is eſpecially managed, by my old Friend, the Learned Mr. <hi>Dodwel,</hi> in's XI. Diſſertati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on <hi>Cyprian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in this he ſeems not only ſingular, but to found his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion upon a falſe Foundation; that becauſe we find not ſo many mention'd in Antiquity, therefore they were fewer, than we commonly account them. For ſome Preſidents of Provinces prohibited the reſerving the Records of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs Tryals: And moſt of thoſe that were recorded, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained to the Times of Chriſtian Emperors; afterwards by the Irruption of the barbarous Nations into the Empire, were loſt. So that we have little more than what <hi>Euſebius</hi> had gather'd up, and Publiſhed, in's Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, and more particularly in two Books of the Martyrs; the former a Collection of the Ancient Martyrs, which is loſt. The latter of thoſe of <hi>Palaſtine</hi> that had ſuffered in his Time. Beſides, 'tis obſervable, that great numbers were ſlain, both by the Magiſtrates and People without any formal Proceſs of Law, and ſo could not be taken Notice of. <hi>Propter Confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem torquetis. Cauſa non judicata ſupplicia infertis,</hi> ſaith <hi>Juſtin</hi> in's <hi>Apology, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon our Confeſſion you Torment us. No Judgment being given of the Cauſe, you puniſh us.</hi> And to the ſame Purpoſe, <hi>Tertul.</hi> in <hi>Apologet.</hi> c. 37. The Governours of Cities and Provinces, being ſtir'd up by the Prieſts and People; made no great difficulty many Times, to Sacrifice them to the Popular Fury. For Things being carried often by Tumults, many were ſlain <hi>quaſi jure Belli,</hi> as if it were in War, ſometimes 10, 20, 30, 60, and ſometimes 100, Men and Women with their little ones were Maſſacred in a Day, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> tells us, <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 33. and <hi>l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 8. and <hi>l.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 9. of his Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>Inſomuch that the Emperors were forced to give Orders for reſtaining them, as <hi>Hadrian Ne quis poſthac ſine objectu criminis &amp; legitima accuſatione condemnaretur. Let none hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be condemned without ſetting forth the Crime, and a legal Accuſation.</hi> Nor are we to reckon the Perſecutions, or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Martyrs, by the Emperors Edicts; for 'tis evident, the <hi>Roman</hi> Rulers and Governors, waited not for any ſuch Decrees, but when any were Accuſed, they Tryed, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd and Executed them, according to the Laws made
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62137:32"/>againſt them. This is evident by <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Proceeding, when he was Proconſul in <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Bithynia,</hi> without <hi>Trajans</hi> Order. Yea, under ſome of the Emperors that more favour'd the Chriſtians, as <hi>Alexander Severus,</hi> through his Mother <hi>Mammea</hi>'s Perſwaſions, though they emitted no Edicts for prohibiting their Perſecution, many Martyrs ſuffered in their Reigns.</p>
               <p>But this Queſtion relating to Matter of Fact, cannot be determined otherwiſe, than by having recourſe to the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians and Ancient Fathers that have written of thoſe Times. Which whoſoever peruſeth, may ſoon ſee that vaſt Army of glorious Martyrs, which may aſtoniſh him, and ſill him with Admiration of their Chriſtian Fortitude, under ſuch direful Sufferings as they underwent.</p>
               <p>It would be endleſs to recite their Sayings, for the great number of Martyrs. In the Third General Perſecution there were innumerable Martyrs. The <hi>Menologia Graecorum</hi> ſay, <hi>Decem millia Chriſtianorum in Monte</hi> Ararat <hi>cruci ſuffixa ſub</hi> Trajano. <hi>That there were ten Thouſand Chriſtians Crucified un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Reign of</hi> Trajan <hi>in the Mountain of</hi> Ararat. In the Fourth under <hi>Adrian, Paſſim Martyrum millena, there were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Thouſands of Martyrs.</hi> And ſo in the following, many thouſands in the general, are reckon'd by ſeveral Authors. <hi>Chytraeus</hi> in's <hi>Hiſtorical Kalender,</hi> reports from the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd <hi>Menology,</hi> 28 Decembris <hi>bis decem millia Martyrum in</hi> Nicomedia <hi>uſtorum, That on the</hi> 28th <hi>of</hi> December <hi>Twenty Thouſand were burnt in</hi> Nicomedia.

But we muſt not ſtay upon Particulars. <hi>Euſeb.</hi> l. 5. ſaith under the Emperor <hi>Antoninus, Innumerabiles prope Martyres per uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſum orbem enituiſſe; That Martyrs almoſt innumerable, were famous throughout the World.</hi> And if in the Fifth Perſecution (as that's uſually reckon'd) alone, were ſo many, what were there in all the Ten or Twelve? <hi>Prudentius Hymno</hi> xi. l. <hi>de Coronis,</hi> ſaith, <hi>In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>From theſe Ancients, it appears, the Primitive Chriſtians held it as a Thing indifferent, as to the acceptableneſs of their Worſhip to God, whether they performed it in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or without: And that Gods Worſhip being meerly of a ſpiritual Nature, the Place though never ſo magnificent and glorious, contributed nothing thereto: Which was directly oppoſite to the Opinion the <hi>Heathen</hi> had of Temples.

               <p>Nor ſay we, that <hi>Lactantius</hi> taxed the <hi>Heathens</hi> barely for their Buildings; but for their Error, in thinking, God was better ſerved in Temples than without: And that the more glorious they were, their Service was more grateful to God.

               <p>Theſe with other of the Ancients, are followed by many of the Learned in after Ages. <hi>Gerhard</hi> the Glory of the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> for Learning, <hi>c.</hi> 2. §. 9. <hi>de Eccleſia,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ex Actis Apoſtolicis, &amp; Seriptoribus vetuſtioribus conſtat, quod Chriſtiani. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolorum tempore nondum habuerunt Publica Templa, ſed in Privatis Domibus convenerunt.</hi> That 'tis manifeſt from the Acts of the Apoſtles, and Ancient Writers, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had no Publick Temples in the Apoſtles Time, but met in Private Houſes.</p>
               <p>The Learned Jeſuit <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> in's excellent Comments on the Epiſtles on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.18. ſaith, The Chriſtian Aſſemblies were firſt <hi>in Privatis Domibus</hi> in Private Houſes; afterwards <hi>in Oratoriis &amp; Eccleſiis,</hi> in Oratories and Churches: Plainly
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62137:35"/>diſtinguiſhing Oratories from Private Houſes, and ſhews by Reaſon of Perſecution, they met very often in Vaults, and Burying-places.

               <p>And that the Primitive Chriſtians thus continued, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Publick Oratories or Churches, is concluded by <hi>Vedelius</hi> in <hi>Ignat. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ltra ducentiſſimum annum, nullum Oratoriorum Publicorum veſtigium apparet:</hi> That there's no footſteps in Antiquity of any Publick Places of Worſhip for above the firſt Two Hundred Years after Chriſt: And upon the ſame grounds <hi>Spanhemius</hi> in <hi>Hiſt.

And all Places there were ſo Dark, that it might well be ſaid of them, according to that of the Prophet, The Living go down into Hell.

               <p>Not that theſe Burying-places were peculiar to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs; for other Chriſtians were alſo Buried there, though not in the ſame Graves, till under Chriſtian Emperors, Churches were Erected in Cities, into which the Martyrs Bodies were brought from without, and Superſtition prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make them the Common Burying-places: Which many Learned Men both Papiſts and Proteſtants have written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, and ſhewn how Injurious 'tis to the Health of the Living, with many other Reaſons; but the Tyrant Cuſtom hath always conquer'd the ſtrongeſt Arguments.</p>
               <p>Nor when they met in ſuch Places, was it for their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping the Reliques of the Martyrs, as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> thence infer: But (beſides their Privacy, being remote from their Cities,) for the preſerving their Memories freſher in their Minds, and by their Examples be excited to Conſtancy in the Faith, and Suffering Martyrdom. And though <hi>Onuphri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62137:36"/>de Caemiteriis,</hi> maintains, that Structures were made for Worſhip in theſe Burial-places; and <hi>Hoſpinian</hi> grants it came to that at length; yet were they but <hi>Sacella,</hi> or Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels under-ground; as <hi>Platina</hi> tells us in the Life of <hi>Calix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> who having ſaid he did not believe that famous and large Church which <hi>Alexander</hi> the Son of <hi>Mammaea</hi> (who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his Reign, <hi>A. D.</hi> 225. according to <hi>Baronius</hi>) had granted the Chriſtians, to be the ſame, with that which <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixtus</hi> was ſaid to have built, on the other ſide of <hi>Tiber,</hi> he gives this Reaſon, <hi>Cun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>a tempeſtate, ob crebras Perſecutiones, occulta eſſent omnia, &amp; ſacella potius, atque eadem abdita, &amp; ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumque ſubterranea, quam apertis in Locis &amp; Publicis fierent.</hi> For in thoſe Days, by Reaſon of frequent Perſecutions, all Things were carried ſecretly: And they had Chappels rather, and thoſe hidden, and for the moſt part under-ground, than in open and publick Places. Which laſt Words are alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by <hi>Pol. Virgil.</hi> If any deſire further Satisfaction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Primitive Chriſtians meeting in thoſe Burial-Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: He may find it in <hi>Kercher</hi>'s <hi>Roma ſubterranea,</hi> l. 1. c. 2. <hi>de Coemeteriis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though theſe Places after ſome time, and Martyrdom under <hi>Nero</hi> and following Emperors, were uſed more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by the Chriſtians, as appears by the Edict of <hi>Decius, Nec uſquam omnino vel vobis, vel aliis quibuſque poteſtas erit aut celebrandi conventus, aut in ea quae coemeteria appellantur ingredi;</hi> Thus the Chriſtians in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and all others were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited their Meetings, or entering into the Coemiteries par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly. As alſo by the Edict of <hi>Valerian,</hi> whereby all their Aſſemblies being ſtrictly prohibited, theſe Places in ſpecial were forbidden them; And as <hi>Gallienus</hi> his Son by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript graciouſly reſtored the Places of Worſhip in general: So by another theſe Coemeteries in ſpecial, <hi>Euſeb. Hiſt.</hi> l. 7. Yet as Neceſſity required, by Reaſon of Perſecution, their Meetings in theſe Places, being found out and known by the <hi>Heathens,</hi> they met elſewhere ſome times in one Place, and ſome times in another, as in Woods, Caves, Mountains, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When they could not in Private Houſes, that they might not be diſcovered. Our Learned <hi>Hooker</hi> in's fifth Book of <hi>Eccleſ. Pol.</hi> §. 11. hath a ſhort, but very comprehenſive Paſſage for this.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:62137:37"/>
               <p>The Church of Chriſt (ſaith He) which was in <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and hold that Profeſſion, which had not, the publick Allowance, and countenance of Authority, could not ſo long uſe the Exerciſe of chriſtian Religion, but in Private only. And as God gave Increaſe to his Church; they ſought out both there, and abroad for that Purpoſe, not the ſitteſt (for ſo the Times would not ſuffer them to do) but the ſafeſt Places they could. In Proceſs of Time, ſome whiles by Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance, ſome whiles by ſpecial Leave and Favour, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to erect to themſelves Oratories. Thus <hi>Hilary</hi> alſo in his Book againſt the <hi>Arrians</hi> and <hi>Auxentius,</hi> ſpeaking of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the Apoſtles Days, affirms that they were, <hi>Per cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacula &amp; ſecreta coenutes,</hi> ſuch as had their Meetings in Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and ſecret Places. Afterwards moſt commonly <hi>in cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miteriis &amp; cryptis,</hi> in ſubterraneous Vaults. And in the Time of his Baniſhment warns them to whom he writes, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of Antichriſt, for you are unhappily taken with the Love of Walls, you do not well in venerating the Church of God for Structures and Edifices: Is it doubtful that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſhall ſit in theſe? <hi>Montes mihi &amp; ſylvae, &amp; lacus, &amp; carceres &amp; vordgines tutiores ſunt,</hi> &amp;c. Mountains and Woods, and Lakes, and Priſons, and Gulfs, are more ſafe to me. For in theſe, the Prophets either abiding or drowned, have Propheſied by the Spirit of God, And <hi>Walafudus Strabo</hi> to the ſame Purpoſe, whoſe Words we recited in Ninth <hi>Section, Page</hi> 40.</p>
               <p>So <hi>Polid. Virgil,</hi> a good Antiquary in's Book <hi>de Inventione rerum,</hi> l. 5. c. 6. affirms that, <hi>à Chriſti aſcenſu, ad</hi> Diocleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num &amp; Maximianum, <hi>toto fere temporis intervallo tantum abe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat, ut aliquod templum à Chriſtianis, publicè aedificaretur; ut eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am ommia eſſent occulta &amp; ſacella potius, atque etiam abdita, &amp; plerumque ſubterranea quàm apertis in Locis ac Publicis fierent.</hi> That from Chriſts Aſcenſion to <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximianus,</hi> for that whole Interval of Time almoſt, the Chriſtians were ſo far from building any Temple in Publick, that all Things were kept ſecret: And Chappels rather, and thoſe alſo hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and for the moſt part under-ground, than in open and publick Places. Though He thinks it credible, where the Fury of perſecuting Tyrants reached not, the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles might Conſecrate ſome Temples, as <hi>Matthew</hi> in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62137:37"/>Bartholomew</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> and <hi>Andrew</hi> in <hi>Scythia,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But theſe are but this Conjectures (for which he brings no Proof in founded upon the Piety of the Apoſtles, who always imployed their utmoſt Power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogate Religion amongſt all Nations. For: we no where find that any of the Apoſtles required the erecting of Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures for Worſhip, or Conſecrating any for that end: Nor the leaſt Signification, that without ſuch, Religion could not be propogated.</p>
               <p>And the Renowned Sir <hi>H. Spelman,</hi> p. 70. <hi>De non teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandis Eccleſiis,</hi> having mentioned the Conſecration of Churches in <hi>Conſtantines</hi> Time, adds, That the Chriſtians being in Elder Ages in Perſecution, might hardly Build or Dedicate any Churches; but were conſtrained to uſe Private Houſes, and Solitary Places for their Aſſemblies. The Learned Mr. <hi>Robert Cook</hi> Viccar of <hi>Leeds</hi> in's <hi>Cenſura quor. Script.</hi> ſhews <hi>Dionyſius</hi> Works to be Counterfeit, becauſe he mentions ſeveral Things, and particularly ſtately Temples, after the manner of that at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> having their <hi>Sancta Sanctorum</hi> divided from the reſt, into which it was not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the Monks and Lay People to enter. Whereas there were no ſuch Things in thoſe Days, ſaith <hi>Cook,</hi> but Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans met together after the Manner of the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.13. and 12.12. and 20.8. in private and ſecret Places, and there had their Prayers and Sermons: Publick Temples they had none by reaſon of Tyrants.</p>
               <p>I might bring in the like Atteſtations from our famous <hi>Jewel</hi> Article 3. <hi>p.</hi> 145. <hi>Willet</hi>'s <hi>Synopſis Papiſmi,</hi> ſixth General Controverſie, <hi>Queſt.</hi> 6. With ſeveral others: But I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all with the Teſtimony of a great Hiſtorian yet living (of whoſe Acquaintance and Friendſhip I have the Honour to partake) <hi>viz,</hi> Dr. <hi>Spanhem</hi> the Honorary Profeſſor at <hi>Leyden,</hi> who in's learned and uſeful Eccleſiaſtical Hiſt. of the New Teſtament ſaith, <hi>Loca Sacrorum Conventuum fuere ſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo ſecundo, partim aedes privatorum, caenacula, balnea, porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, cryptae, loca abdita. Partim caemeteria ſeu Sepulchreta Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrum ad quae Conventus indicerent, zelo accendendo, his conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae exemplis.</hi> The Places of the Chriſtians Meetings in the Second Century, were partly Private Houſes, Dining Rooms, Baths, Galleries, Vaults, and ſecret Places: Partly Burial-Places
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62137:38"/>or Sepulchres of the Martyre, which they appointed their Meetings, for the inflaming their Zeal, by thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Conſtancy. And afterwards ſhews, the Manner of notifying their Conventions, was by their Servants from Houſe to Houſe: For as yet neither the beating of Wood, nor ſound of Bells, or Braſs, or Voice of Cryers were uſed for, this end, loſt their Aſſemblies ſhould be known to the <hi>Heathens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Third Century, whether the Chriſtians had any Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or Churches Dedicated or Conſecrated by Sacred and Chriſtian Rites is, ſaith He, a Controverſie amongſt the Learned. <hi>Pol. Virgil, Durantus, Baronius, Bellarminus, Ciaconi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> and <hi>Valcſius</hi> affirm it. And of ours alſo <hi>Wower, Fuller, Selden</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>That Churches are frequently mentioned in this Age, is out of doubt: <hi>At nec Temptorum illis aut Nomen, aut Forma, aut Splendor, aut Species quaedam. Aedes fuere Privatorum, Domus, caenacula, ſed plorumque caemeteria, Cryptae ſpatioſiſſimae, quas areas Martyrum dixere; etiam latibula, ſtabula, oremi, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceres, agri ex Antiquis Scripporibus, &amp; ox Conditione Temporum, ſaeviente ut plurimum Perſecutions. Quanquam ſub.</hi> Al. Severo, <hi>&amp;</hi> Philippis, <hi>&amp;</hi> Gallieno, <hi>conveniendi libertas Chriſtianis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor. Hinc nulla eſſe Chriſtianis Templa. Quae memorantur Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pla, Tituli, Conſecrationum Ritus Sacerdotales, à</hi> Baronio, Cia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conio, Fr. Bivario, <hi>aliis; ea ex Apocryphis Decretalibus, ex Pontific. vitis, ex</hi> Flavii Dextri <hi>Chronico Suppoſititio, id genus fontibus lutulentis hauſta.</hi> But they had neither the Name, nor Form, nor Splendor, nor Shape or Kind of Temples. They were the Dwellings of Private Perſons, Houſes, Dining-Rooms, and for the moſt part Burying-places, very ſpacious Vaults, which they called the Floors of the Martyrs: Alſo Lurking-places, Stables, Wilderneſſes, Priſons, Fields, as from Ancient Writers, and the Condition of thoſe Times is manifeſt, Perſecution then for the moſt Part raging. All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though under <hi>Al. Sevetus,</hi> the <hi>Philips,</hi> and <hi>Gallienus,</hi> greater Liberty was given for Chriſtian Aſſemblies. Hence we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the Chriſtians yet had no Temples. Thoſe Temples, Titles, and Sacerdotal Rites of Conſecration, mentioned by <hi>Baronius, Ciaconius, Fr. Bivarius,</hi> and others; are all taken from the Apocryphal Decretals, the Lives of the Popes, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62137:38"/>the Suppoſititious Chronicle of <hi>Flavius Dexter,</hi> and ſuch like impure Fountains. Thus far that Learned Profeſſor.</p>
               <p>To draw up all in a ſhort Concluſion. We read in <hi>Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> of the Chriſtians building Publick Oratories after <hi>Deeius</hi> and <hi>Valerians</hi> Days, not of any built before. Theſe were by Publick Decrees, commanded to be pulled down by <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Maximus,</hi> and not long after reſtored by <hi>Conſiantine.</hi> Thoſe formerly taken from the Chriſtians by <hi>Decius</hi> and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerian,</hi> were expreſſed to be <hi>Caemeteria</hi> Places of Burial in which they had their <hi>Cryptae</hi> or Vaults under-ground, formerly repreſented. So that for ſeparate and publick Places for Worſhip, for Two Hundred Years and more after Chriſts. Nativity, we have no Records in approved Hiſtory.</p>
