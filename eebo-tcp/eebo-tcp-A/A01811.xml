            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

What euer the matter was, many there were, who by accuſing others ſought the Kings favour, and inlarged their owne eſtates, amongſt whom two were chiefe; the one was called RICHARD EMPSON, the other EDMVND DVDLEY, both Lawiers, and both for having ſerved the Kings turne, lately made Barons of the Exchequer. It is ſaid that

 EMPSON was borne at <hi>Torceſter</hi> in <hi>Northampton</hi> Shire, his Father was a Siuier. DVDLEY, though he were well deſcended, yet being not befriended by fortune, long ſtrugled with adverſitie But after they had ſome moneths taken paines in theſe matters, both of them ariſe to that greatneſſe, that there were few of the Nobilitie, that would not crouch to them and be ambitious of their fauour. Therefore it is not ſo much to be wondred at, if they grew exceeding weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy: but this wealth drew with it an envy greater then it ſelfe, which neuertheleſſe did them little hurt during the life of HENRY the Seventh, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards caſt them both downe as low, as enuie could haue wiſht. The King vpon his death-bed comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in his Will and Teſtament, that reſtitution ſhould bee made to all, who had beene wronged by the Exchequer. Whereupon infinite numbers floc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to the Court, and demanding reſtitution, there could not a fitter meanes be thought of to ſtop their mouthes, then by committing of EMPSON and DVDLEY the occaſioners thereof, to the people as Sacrifices to appeaſe their fury.

But to let paſſe the great number of Nobilitie, whoſe carcaſes found about him ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently teſtifie, that they guarded their true King, and conſequently that the counterfaite fought elſe-where: it is manifeſt that his body was knowne by many of the Captives, who certainly affirmed, that it could bee no other then the Kings, although by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of wounds it were much defaced. For his necke was opened to the midſt with a wide wound, his left hand almoſt cut off in two places did ſcarce hang to his arme, and the Archers had ſhot him in many places of his body.</p>
                     <p>Thus was IAMES the Fourth King of <hi>Scots</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away in the flower of his youth, who truly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his Princely Vertues deſerved a longer life.

This was now growne the common diſcourſe, and had gon ſo far, that one LINCOLNE a ringlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of this tumultuous rout, did not ſtick to perſuade ſome Preachers, publiquely in the Pulpit to lay open theſe common grieuances before the Eſtates of the Realme. Our Ladies Hoſpitall in <hi>London,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Spittle,</hi> is famous for the <hi>Eaſter</hi> Sermons; one of which was to be preached by Doctor HENRY STANDISH (afterward Biſhop of S. <hi>Aſaph)</hi> a graue and learned man. LINCOLNE had aſſaied him, and had the deniall, as in a matter, the very mention whereof a good Patriot ſhould abhorre. But Doctor BELL a Diuine, who was after STANDISH to preach in the ſame Place, without feare or wit ſeconding their ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious attempts, did publiquely in his Sermon read the Bill by them exhibited to him, taking for his text that of the Prophet in the 115 Pſalme: <hi>The heauens, euen the heauens are the Lords; but he hath giuen the earth to the ſonnes of men:</hi> Thence moſt fooliſhly concluding, that <hi>England</hi> was giuen to Engliſhmen only, and that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was not to be endured, that Aliens ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy any part therof. Many things by him ſpoken to this purpoſe, were accepted with great applauſe and approbation of the Vulgar, who out of extreame ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to Strangers, breathed nothing but ſedition. And to adde more fuell to this fire, it happened that many outrages were about that time committed by ſome of theſe Strangers. This euill then thus ſpreading it ſelfe,

foreiners were euery where ill intreated, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly knockt downe in the ſtreets, hauing not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered iniurie to any man. The authors of theſe riots being by the L. Maior committed to priſon, a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den rumor ran through the Citie, That on <hi>May</hi> day next all Strangers ſhould be maſſacred. This with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt proceeded from ſome of this vnruly crue, and was intended as a watchword to all the faction; but the Strangers made ſo good vſe of it, that they had all withdrawne themſelues before that time, and the Magiſtrates very carefully atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded each occaſion, endeauouring to cruſh all tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous deſignes in the ſhell.

But before this had beene throughly proclaimed, an Alderman walking in the ſtreets, ſaw a troupe of young men conſiſting of Apprentices and ſuch like gathered together, and playing at cudgels. He ſharpely reprooued them for not obeying the Kings Edict, withall threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to puniſh them, if they the ſooner betooke not themſelues euery one to his home. Words not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailing, he laid hold on one or two, intending to haue committed them. But what reckoning they made of Authoritie, their reſiſtance in reſcue of their Companions ſhewed; and by outcries giuing an Alarme, drew together all the reſt of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in that quarter of the Citie. The fame of this hurly-burly encreaſed their numbers, by ſending mariners, gentlemens ſeruants, beggars, &amp; Citiſens,

 but the greateſt part were Apprentices. Sedition like a torrent carried them headlong, and animated them to all villanie.

The Executioner readie to turne off ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was preuented by the Kings gracious Pardon. The minde of man beeing prone to pittie, wee may imagine, that others were well pleaſed at the newes; but certainely the condemned had cauſe to reioice.

 the Emperour alway keeping the right hand, and the Earle of <hi>Derby</hi> bearing the Sword before them both. <hi>Canterburie</hi> is a Citie more famous for antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, than for moderne beauty. To let paſſe, that it was aboue a thouſand yeares ſince made an Archiepiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Sea, our Chronicles do ſufficiently teſtify, that both in reſpect of priuate mens faire houſes, and the magnificent ſtructure of it's Churches, it antiently excelled the braueſt cities of <hi>England.</hi> But within theſe few yeares it hath loſt ſo much of it's greatneſſe and beautie, that a man ſhall finde little of <hi>Canterburie</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the name. Why it ſhould ſo much in ſo ſhort ſpace decay, many reaſons may be alledged: As the vicinity of <hi>London,</hi> which ſwelling like the ſpleene, ſuckes both bloud and moiſture from all the other languiſhing Cities of the Kingdome. Likewiſe the ſubuerſion of Saint AVGVSTINES Monaſterie, the loſſe of <hi>Calais,</hi> and the pulling downe of Archbiſhop BECKET his Shrine, things which occaſioned a great concourſe of people, and did by their loſſe and ouerthrow much impaire this Cities ſplendor. One only Ornament therof ſuruiues, which is the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drall and Metropoliticall Church, with ſuch a Maieſty piercing the skies (ſaith ERASMVS) that it a far off fills the beholder with deuout amazement. This Church being at firſt dedicated to our Sauiour CHRIST, a few ages paſt degenerated into the nickname of S. THOMAS. This THOMAS ſurnamed BECKET, hauing obſtinatly oppoſed HENRY the ſecond, was in this Church ſlain by certaine ſoldiers: and being afterward canonized for a Saint, his ſepulchre mightily encreaſed the glory of the place. For from thoſe times euen almoſt to our dayes, all ſorts of people from all parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitiouſly frequented the Shrine of this vpſtart Saint, with rich oblations indeuoring to procure his fauor. Hence the Monaſtery was ſo inriched, that of it
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:7277:28"/>
and the Church ERASMVS ſaid, <hi>That euery place was enlightened with the luſtre of moſt pretious and huge ſtones, and the Church throughout abounded with more than Royall Treaſure.</hi> But the Shrine eſpecially, that contained the reliques of this Saint, was ſo emboſſed with jewels, that gold was the meaneſt thing about it. Hither accompanied with King HENRY, came the Emperor CHARLES, but whether out of deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or curioſitie, I cannot ſay. But this is certaine, that the Cardinall and the Clergie going in proceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to the Church they went directly, where a great deale of time was ſpent in Ceremonious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and ablations at BECKETS Tome, not onely by the Emperour, but euen by Him, who ſhortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter defaced the Monument, and ſeiſed vpon that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Treaſure, heaped vp by the deuout follie of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny preceding ages. From the Church they went to the Archbiſhops Palace, where the Queene, Aunt to the Emperour, awaited them, and very ioyfully wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commed her Nephew. Three dayes were ſpent in banketing &amp; paſtimes, and then the Emperour went to his Nauy at <hi>Sandwich,</hi> the King and Queene to <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,</hi> from whence they paſſed to <hi>Calais,</hi> that the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded interuiew of the two Kings might worke it's due effects. The ſeuenth of <hi>Iune</hi> was the appointed day. The place, betweene <hi>Ardres</hi> and <hi>Guiſnes.</hi> There the<note place="margin">Enterview betwixt the Kings of England and France.</note> two Kings mounted on Spaniſh Gennets, attended by ſuch a multitude of Nobilitie, as the occaſions of a hundred yeres before had not at once brought toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the like, incountred each other, both in the floure of their age, the goodlieſt Princes of the world, and moſt expert in all kinde of combates both on horſe and foot. It were needleſſe to ſet forth the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of theſe Princes, when the brauerie of their attendants was ſuch, that the place was thence named <hi>The golden campe.</hi> Hauing embraced each other on
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:7277:29"/>
 horſeback, they alight and betake themſelues to a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilion there purpoſely pitched: HENRY attended on by the Cardinall of <hi>Yorke,</hi> and the Dukes of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke</hi> and <hi>Suffolke;</hi> FRANCIS by the Admirall BO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIVET, the Chancellour <hi>du</hi> PRAT, and ſome other Counſellors. Hauing had familiar conference con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſome priuate matters, they gaue order for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting a Theater, and encloſing a ground for a Tilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, that ſo they might ſolace themſelues, whiles their Counſell treated of grauer matters, the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion whereof they might at leiſure euery day know by relation. Fourteene dayes theſe Princes gaue each other the meeting, with great concourſe of moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſoldiers. HENRY then entertained the French King at <hi>Guiſnes,</hi> in a houſe made of timber (framed partly in <hi>England,</hi> partly in <hi>Holland,</hi> and thence brought thither) wherein there were foure Manſions: The out ſide was couered with cloth ſo painted, that it would haue deceiued the beholders for ſquared ſtone: the in ſide was hung with moſt rich Arras, ſo that it euery way ſeemed a moſt artificiall and ſtately Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. The forme of it was much like that of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change at <hi>Calais.</hi> It being afterward taken aſunder, was tranſported into <hi>England,</hi> and ſo ſtood the King in little or nothing, ſaith BELLAY. (Whereas wee know, and that by Records, that there were ſent ouer out of <hi>England</hi> for this Worke, three hundred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſix hundred Carpenters, two hundred Painters, Glaſiers, and other Artificers (in all eleuen hundred) which for the ſpace of two moneths laboured conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually on this fabricke.) The day enſuing, the French King prepares a banquet: the banqueting houſe was a Canopy euery way extended ſixtie foot, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out was couered with cloath of Tiſſue, within with blew velvet pouldred with golden floures <hi>de Lys.</hi> At each corner was a Pauilion of the ſame workes: the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:7277:29"/>
cords were of blew ſilke twiſted with gold of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus,</hi> which was of great eſteeme. But a moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuous and tempeſtuous winde broke aſunder the cords, and laid all this brauerie in the dirt. <hi>Patience par force.</hi> The French King ſuddenly makes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther banquetting houſe, in that place where there is now a Fort that takes it's name from this banquet. The preparations were extraordinary, and the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence outſtripped the reach of humane iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There wanted neither houſes, woods, nor fields for diſport; for many men brought them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire on their backes. But pleaſures muſt haue their intermiſſion, and Kings if not by their Greatneſſe, are by their Affaires ſeuered. HENRY therefore returnes to <hi>Calais,</hi> and FRANCIS to <hi>Boloigne.</hi> The tenth of the enſuing moneth, the King gallantly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, viſited the Emperour at <hi>Graueling.</hi> The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Henry</hi> viſits the Emperor at Graueling</note> in requitall accompanied him backe to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais.</hi> Shewes and banquets are Princes vſuall enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments. To this end, the King ſo commanding, a round building is made in the forme of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiteatre, eight hundred foot in compaſſe. The ſides were of plankes: in the middle was a pillar made of eight great maſts tied together. This pillar ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the weight not onely of the roofe of the whole fabricke, (whither as into a lower Heauen the Moone and Stars had deſcended) but Organs alſo, and places for the receipt of all ſorts of muſicke in aboundance. Theſe places were adorned with ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtrie, ſtatues, and curious pictures, inſomuch that the moſt fault finding could not complaine of any want in that kinde. All things were now prepared for the entertainment of ſuch a gueſt, and the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet readie to be ſerued in, when the ſame miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance that befel the French Canopy, made our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Heauen and Earth meet together.

 with the mad prodigality of theſe two Kings, ſent a tempeſt, the violence whereof ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this counterfeit heauen, blew out aboue a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand wax tapers, defaced the glorious thrones pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for theſe Princes, fruſtrated the expectation of the people, and forced the King to the neceſſitie of another place. But to lec paſſe the tilting, maskes, and gorgeous feaſts during the ſix dayes the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror ſtayed at <hi>Calais:</hi> In theſe ſeueral enterviewes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene all theſe Princes there was no one ſerious thing done, but this, that a firme Peace, a perpetuall League, &amp; faithfull Friendſhip ſeemed to be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on all ſides. For who would haue thought, that it had been poſſible for diſcord it ſelfe to haue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olued this knot, where CHARLES &amp; FRANCIS attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted ſo much to HENRY, that they made him Vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier of all controuerſies that ſhould ariſe betweene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>? But that there is ſeldom any heed to be giuen to the Agreements of Princes, where they are tied by no other bands (as of Religion, Affinity, or mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Vtility) than that weake one of their plighted Troth, thoſe foule diſſentions, and bloudy wars which afterwards rent all Chriſtendome, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a way for that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon enemy of our Faith, may be a ſufficient example.

EDWARD his ſon reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Bloud &amp; Dignities by HENRY 7. for his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, wealth, and Honors, inferior to none but the King, not content with this, was by N.

 curteſy to win the minds of the people, for the time was at hand wherein this ſhould certainly come to paſſe, if it were not through his owne default. The Duke (no ſot, but blinded by ambition) gaue ſuch credit to the Monke, who was either mad, or elſe flattered him in hope of reward, that although the time prefixed for theſe miracles were paſt, yet was he ſtill in hope, fed the Impoſtor with gifts, who fed him with aire, ſecretly vilified the King, and gaue profuſely to all. Nay he could not forbeare, but at longth he muſt brag of the Iuglers promiſes, as hee did to a gentleman named CHARLES KNEVET, to whom he boldly vnmasked himſelfe, and gaue a reaſon of his actions. Vpon KNEVETS accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he was arraigned, &amp; condemned the thirteenth of <hi>May,</hi> and on the ſeuenteenth publiquely behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. His death was lamented by many, &amp; the rather for that he was no way faulty, but in his vanity and pride, which ouerthrew him. Being a childe, I haue heard antient men ſay, that by his brauery of appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, and ſumptuous feaſts he exaſperated the King, with whom in theſe things he ſeemed to contend. But he could by no meanes beare with the intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable pride of the Cardinall, whoſe hatred not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probably prooued fatall vnto him, rather than did the Kings diſpleaſure: for many times Princes are with leſſe danger offended, than their Mignons. There goes a tale, That the Duke once holding the baſen to the King, the Cardinall when the King had done, preſently dipped his hands in the ſame water: the Duke diſdaining to debaſe himſelfe to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of a Prieſt, ſhed the water in his ſhoos.

day to Court, richly (as he vſually was) apparelled, but without skirts to his dublet. The King &amp; many others demanding what he meant by that ſtrange faſhion, he anſwered readily, <hi>That it was done by way of preuention, for the Cardinall ſhould not now ſit vpon his skirts.</hi> Hee thought he had put a jeſt vpon the Cardinal, to whoſe informations, as proceeding from enuy and ſpleen, he hoped the King would hereafter giue the leſſe credit. But he miſſed his marke: for moſt men were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the Cardinalls malice cruſhed him rather, than did the weight of his owne offences. It was the ſaying of CHARLES the Emperor, vpon the report of his death, <hi>That the Butchers Dog had killed the faireſt Hart of</hi> England Howſoeuer it came to paſſe, the king who had hitherto ruled without bloudſhed, induced by the former reaſons (ſo the Records run) permitted his hands to be ſtained with the bloud of this poore Prince; many lamenting, that the indiſcreet credulity of one man, hauing not attempted ought againſt the Eſtate, ſhould be the ouerthrow of ſo noble a Family.

did not conſecrate himſelfe to idleneſſe, but to God. It is reported, how truly I know not, that recreating himſelfe in the fields, his companion with whom he then diſcourſed, was ſuddenly ſtricken dead with thunder. He therupon falling into due conſideration of the vncertaintie of death, and of iudgment, left the ſtudy of the Ciuill Law, to which he then applied himſelfe, and renouncing the world, betooke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to a Cloiſter, where for his deportment he was beyond exception, for learning (eſpecially diuine) he was ſcarce matchable. Vpon this horrible abuſe of the authority of the Keyes, being inflamed with a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous zeale, he could not containe himſelfe, but boldly and bitterly inueighed againſt this groſſe impiety. Neither ſtaied he there, but (ſtorme the Pope neuer ſo much) proceeds to other enormities in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſome whereof that Church hath ſince refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the reſt religious Princes, by LVTHER awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of their dead ſleepe of ſuperſtition, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the practiſes of <hi>Rome,</hi> haue (God be thanked) exploded.

 therefore not likely (as indeed he did not) to ſurvive him. In the mean time he might make an aſcent, by which his ambition might clime.

They might perſonally treat &amp; conclude more ſafely &amp; ſecurely than by Agents &amp; Poſts, of whom in matters of moment no wiſe man would make vſe, vnles forced by neceſſity. But the chiefe cauſe (as I coniecture) of this his ſecond co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England,</hi> was, that he was weary of WOLSEY, with whom he ſaw it was impoſſible long to continue friend. For the Cardinall by his importunity, one while for the Papacy, another while for the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhopricke of <hi>Toledo,</hi> did much moleſt him, who had determined to afford him nothing but good words. He diſdained not in his letters to a <hi>Butchers ſon,</hi> to vſe that honorable compellation of <hi>Couzen,</hi> &amp; whether preſent or abſent, he afforded him all kind of honor whatſoeuer. But when the Cardinall cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued any erneſt of his loue, ſome excuſe or other was found out to put him by, yet ſo, as ſtill to entertaine him with hopes. But WOLSEY was ſubtill, and of a great ſpirit. And theſe deuiſes were now growne ſo ſtale, that they muſt needs be perceiued. CHARLES therfore neglecting his wonted courſe by WOLSEY, ſtudies how to be aſſured of the King without him. For this no fitter means could be thought of, then this interview. The King was naturally courteous, loued the Emperour exceedingly, and repoſed great confidence in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> CHARLES therefore hoped that by the familiarity of ſome few weekes hee might make the King his owne. But HENRY (he thought) would not long continue ſo, vnleſſe he could ſome way leſſen his fauor toward the Cardinall. This he hoped might be effected by admoniſhing the King, that he was now paſt the yeares of a childe, and needed no Tutor, that it was not fit he ſhould ſuffer himſelfe to be ſwaied by a Prieſt, one in all reaſon better skilled in the myſteries of the Altar, than of

 Holineſſe, to intermeddle with the wars of Princes. The Venetians at firſt anſwered coldly, at length plainely denied: for they ſtood in awe of the <hi>French,</hi> and were jealous of the Emperours ambition.

Now WOLSEY to make a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betweene theſe two Princes, told the King, that he certainly found that the Emperour did but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude him: that hee had indeed promiſed to marry the Kings Daughter; but a rumour was raiſed by the Spaniards, That this match would be little ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for his profit or his honor, foraſmuch as vpon the point, the Lady MARY was but a Baſtard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, it is true, in wedlocke, yet inceſtuouſly, the match being by the Eccleſiaſticall Conſtitutions made vnlawfull: for he could not lawfully marry Queene CATHARINE, who had beene before married to his brother Prince ARTHVR: That both the old and new Teſtaments were expreſſe againſt ſuch coniunctions, and that therefore it lay not in the Pope to diſpence with them. It is certaine that the Emperors Embaſſadors had thus diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with WOLSEY vpon this very point, and WOLSEY made his vſe of it accordingly. Hee knew the King doated not on his Queene, and buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed theſe things in his eares, in hope he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinke himſelfe of a new wife.

                     <p>And yet this proiect was not altogether fruitleſſe, the Kings apparant want affording a ſufficient pretext of deferring the war with <hi>France</hi> vntill another yeare. Neither was it the Kings intent to make vſe of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages

Then hee wiſhed him to ſtop his eares againſt thoſe ſlanderous tongues that branded him with Hereſy: for this was the ſumme of his Doctrine, That wee muſt bee ſaued through Faith in Christ, who did beare the puniſhment of our ſinnes in every part, and throughout his whole body, who dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for vs, and riſing againe, raigneth with the Father for euer.

Bearing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe as neuter betweene the Emperor and the <hi>French</hi> King, hee makes them both become iealous of him. And war being renewed in <hi>Italy,</hi> hee perceives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe likely againe to become a prey to the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.

                     <p>Theſe thoughts poſſeſſing the Pope, CAESAR'S affaires in <hi>Italy</hi> began to decline, almoſt all the Townes throughout the Realme of <hi>Naples</hi> out of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred to the inſolent <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and affection to the <hi>French,</hi> making offer of their Keyes, and receiving Gariſons of <hi>French.</hi> CLEMENT therefore did not now much ſtand in awe of the Emperour, much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whoſe minde he was intreated to ſend a Legate<note place="margin">Cardinall <hi>Campegius</hi> ſent into <hi>England.</hi>
                        </note> into <hi>England,</hi> LAWRENCE CAMPEGIVS Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall and Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who together with the Cardinall of <hi>Yorke</hi> ſhould have the hearing of this Cauſe ſo long controverted to no purpoſe. And the more to teſtifie his affection to the King, he did by a Decretall Bull (but privately drawne) pronounce the Kings marriage with CATHARINE to bee void. This Bull was committed to the Legate, with theſe inſtractions, That having ſhewed it to the King and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:7277:50"/>
the Cardinall of <hi>Yorke.</hi> Hee ſhould withall ſignifie to them, that he had authoritie to publiſh it: but not to give ſentence, vntill hee received new inſtructions; telling him, that he was content the King ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy the benefit of it (and it may be hee was then ſo minded) but that it ſtood him vpon to haue this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe delayed, vntill he had ſufficiently ſecured him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from the Emperour. Theſe were the pretences of the old Fox to the Legate. But his meaning was to make vſe of all ſeaſons, and to turne with the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The ninth of <hi>October</hi> to <hi>London</hi> comes the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, the King having given order to the Citie for his ſolemne entertaiment. But the old mans infirmitie fruſtrated their preparations: hee was grievouſly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with the gout, and would bee privately brought into the Citie. After a few dayes reſt, carried in a chaire, he was brought to the King's preſence, to whom his Secretary made a Latin Oration, wherein having much complained of the extreme crueltie of the Imperials in the ſacking of <hi>Rome;</hi> he vſed many words to ſignifie, that the Kings pious bounty ſhewed in his liberally relieving them in ſo needfull a ſeaſon was moſt acceptable to the Pope and the whole Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Cardinals. To this ſpeech EDWARD FOX (afterward Biſhop of <hi>Hereford)</hi> returned an anſwere in Latine, wherein he declared, <hi>That his Maieſtie was much grieved at his Holineſſe calamitie, foraſmuch as man is naturally touched with a feeling of anothers miſeries. That He had not onely performed what could bee expected from him as a man; but had alſo done the part of a friend for a friend, and what was due from a Prince to</hi> CHRIST'S <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>icar on earth. He did therefore hope, that in reguard of his filiall obedience to the Holy Sea, if it ſhould happen that He ſhould ſtand in need of its aſsiſtance and authoritie, his Holineſſe would be pleaſed readily to grant thoſe things, which it might beſeeme a Sonne to crave of the common Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                        <pb n="86" facs="tcp:7277:51"/>
 Thus much paſſed in publique. The King and the Legates conferring in private, CAMPEGIVS aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured the King of the Popes forwardneſſe to pleaſure him. CAMPEGIVS was indeed no bad man, and ſpake truly, what hee thought. For CLEMENT knowing how difficult a matter it was to deceive a man that was no foole, by one conſcious of the guile, and that was not deceiued himſelfe; made the Legate beleeue, that in this matter of the Divorce hee would be readie to doe for the King whatſoeuer hee ſhould demand.</p>
                     <p>After theſe paſſages, the Legates ſpent ſixe whole moneths in conſultation only concerning their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding in the Kings Divorce. In the meane time the King vnderſtanding, that among his ſubiects, but eſpecially the women kinde, this his action was much traduced, as if Hee tooke this courſe more to ſatisfie his Luſt, then his Conſcience; to give a ſtop to all farther rumours, having aſſembled all the Nobles of the Realme, Iudges, Lawiers, and as many of the better ſort of Commonsas could conveniently attend, vpon the eight of <hi>November</hi> made an Oration to this effect:</p>

So that whether you conſider the ſweet fruits of plentifull Peace, or the glory of Our warlike exploits, We dare boldly avouch, Wee have ſhewed Our Selfe not vnworthy of Our Ancestors, whom (without offence bee it ſpoken) Wee have in all points equalled. But when wee reflect vpon the neceſſary end of Our fraile life, We are ſurpriſed with feare, leaſt the miſeries of future times ſhould ſo obſcure the ſplendour and memory of Our preſent felicitie, that as the <hi>Romans</hi> did after the death of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi> ſo you may hereafter bee forced to wiſh with teares, either that VVe had never beene, or might have perpetually lived to governe you.

How grievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this relation afflicted Vs, God the Searcher of Our hearts knowes. For theſe words did ſeeme to queſtion, not onely Our deare Conſort, and Our Daughter, but euen the very eſtate of Our ſoule, which after death muſt neceſſarily vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go eternall and inevitable torments, if being admoniſhed of ſo horrible an Incest, We ſhould not indevour an amendement; And for your parts, you cannot but foreſee how great dangers by reaſon of this doubt do threaten you and your Poſterity. Being therefore deſirous (as the caſe indeed required) to bee reſolved in this point, Wee first conferred with Our Friends, and then with the moſt learned in the Lawes
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:7277:52"/>
both Divine and Humane; who indeed were ſo farre from ſatisfying <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s, that they left <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s more perplexed. Wee therefore had recourſe to the Holy Apoſtolique Sea, to the Decree whereof VVe thinke it fitting, that Our Selfe and all others ſhould bee obedient. To this and no other end (We call immortall God to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) have wee procured this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enerable Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate. As for the Queene Our moſt beloved Conſort, whatſoever women may tattle, or ill willers mutter in private, We do willingly and ingenuouſly profeſſe, that in nobleneſſe of Mind ſhe far tranſcends the greatneſſe of her Birth: ſo that if wee were now at liberty and free for a ſecond choice, We take God to witneſſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the plenty of the worlds Beauties wee would not make choice of any other (if lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wee might) then of this Our now Queene, one in regard of her mildneſſe, wiſdome, humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſanctity of minde, and converſation (We are verily perſwaded) not to be paralleled.

 whereof each one ſhould prefer before his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate life or fortunes. Thus much have you heard from Our owne mouth. And we hope, that you will hereafter give no heed either to ſeditious detractions, or idle rumours of the people.</q>

                     <p>Full twenty yeares had WOLSEY ſerved the King, behaving himſelfe ſo, that hee grew power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and wealthy beyond a private fortune, and to the reſt of the King's Titles had procured the addition of that rich one of, <hi>a good Prince.</hi> For as often as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how laudably HENRY had hitherto ruled, and behold the calamities of enſuing times, I cannot but accord with them, who aſcribe the ſway which he did beare over all the Princes of Chriſtendome to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of WOLSEY his counſailes. But WOLSEY being taken away, to whom ſhall we impute thoſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Luſt, Tyrannie, and Avarice, two Wives kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, two put away, ſo many (and among them many of the greater ſort) put to death for their Religion only, extremitie only differing in the manner vſed by Hanging againſt Papiſts, by Fire againſt Heretiques, (theſe were the termes of thoſe dayes) &amp; the Church (or rather the Common-wealth) horribly ſpoiled and robbed of her Patrimony? Certainly had WOLSEY ſate at the Sterne, the King had never like a Ship de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of a Pilot, beene carried to and fro with ſuch contrary and vncertaine motions. But inordinate
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:7277:57"/>
 greatneſſe is alwayes a burthen to it ſelfe, the waight whereof is augmented by the vſuall attendance of publique <hi>enny</hi> and <hi>hatred</hi> the misbegotten Elfes of long and powerfull happineſſe.</p>
                     <p>WOLSEY, the King once offended, began preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to totter, and at his firſt frowne as at the roaring of a Lion (before any harder courſe was taken with him) was ſo deiected, that although he after ſeemed a little to lift vp his head, yet was hee never able to ſtand on his feet. Nay, the King being once alienated from him would never after admit him to his preſence. Behold power of baſe Detraction (yet I will not exclude the the greatneſſe of the Cardinals wealth already devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in conceit) which wipes away the remembrance of the faithfull ſervice of ſo many yeares, and the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of ſo great glory purchaſed to the King by WOLSEY'S labours. I am not ignorant what things were obiected againſt him. But they carry ſo little ſhew of probability, that I ſhould much ſuſpect his iudgement, that would give any credit to them. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it was knowne that the King inraged at the ſlow proceedings in the cauſe of his Divorce did day and night breath out againſt him threats and revenge, no man ever preferred Bill againſt him, which conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the vſuall ſevere courſes held by our Parliaments, muſt needs acquit him of Abuſe of Power. As for the cauſes of the King's anger, wee will derive them rather from his owne diſcontents, then WOLSEY'S faultineſſe.</p>
                     <p>The King by this time knew the treachery of the diſſembling Pope. Hee had neere five yeares wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Labyrinth of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and could find no clue to lead him out. He therefore determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to make a way where he could not find one, and like ALEXANDER by force to vndoe that <hi>Gordian</hi> knot, which by wit and labour hee could not. To
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:7277:57"/>
WOLSEY therefore hee communicated his intent of marrying another whether the Pope were willing or no, wiſhing him withall to finde out ſome courſe or other, whereby CAMPEGIVS his Colleague (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the late Mandates to the contrary) might be drawne to give ſentence on his ſide. Many things might be pretended to excuſe the deed, but chiefly the feare of the King's high diſpleaſure, which peradventure hee ſhould feele too, vnleſſe hee aſſented to the King's iuſt requeſt. WOLSEY his anſwer to this I cannot relate. But this is certaine, that WOLSEY, whether for that he did not approve of the King's intended courſe ſeeming (as the times were then) full of raſhneſſe and inſolence, or that he would not vndertake the attempting of his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league, or that (as SLEIDAN writes) the King had notice, that the Cardinall had adviſed the Pope not to approve of the Divorce from CATHARINE, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the King was then reſolved to marry ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infected with <hi>Lutheraniſme:</hi> WOLSEY I ſay was ſo ſharply taken vp and threatned by the King, that even then you might reade in his face and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures the ſymptomes of his waining fortune. For the Cardinall at that time returning from the Court by water, the Biſhop of <hi>Carlile</hi> being with him in the ſame Barge, complained of the heate which was then extraordinary: to whom WOLSEY replied, <hi>My Lord, if you had beene but now in my place, you would have found it hot indeed.</hi> And as ſoone as hee came home, he put off his clothes, and went ſicke to bed. Before hee had repoſed himſelfe an houre and halfe, the Viſcount <hi>Rochfort</hi> came to him, and in the King's Name willed, that hee and his Colleague ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly repaire to the Queene, and exhort her not to contend any longer with the King, for that it would be more for her good and the honour of them both
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:7277:58"/>
 to ſubmit herſelfe to the King's pleaſure, then to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the diſgrace of a publique iudgement. For it was now brought to that puſh, that longer deferred<note place="margin">The Legates repaire to the Queene.</note> it could not be. The Cardinall advertiſed of the King's pleaſure did ariſe, and with his Colleague went to the Queene, who having notice of their comming, went forth and met them. After mutuall ſalutations the Cardinals deſired ſhee would vouchſafe a few words in private, but the Queene refuſed to entertaine any conference with them but where ſhe might have witneſſes of what paſſed. WOLSEY then began to ſpeake in Latine, but the Queene interrupted him, willing, that although ſhe vnderſtood Latin, yet hee ſhould ſpeake in Engliſh. So in the names of both<note place="margin">Their confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with her.</note> Legates he began a ſpeech in Engliſh, wherein <hi>hee profeſſed a great deale of obſervance and dutie to her, and that they came to no other end, but to adviſe her for her</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Her anſwer.</note> 
                        <hi>good.</hi> The Queene anſwered them much after this manner:</p>
                     <q>As for your good will, I thanke you: as for your adviſe, I will give you the hearing. But the matter (I beleeve) about which you come, is of ſo great importance, that it will require a great deale of deliberation, and the helpe of a braine ſurpaſsing that of feminine weakneſſe. You ſee my employments <hi>(ſhewing them a skaine of white thred hanging about her necke)</hi> in theſe I ſpend my time among my Maides, which indeed are none of the greateſt Counſailers: yet I have none other in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> (where they are on whom I dare relie) God wot is farre enough hence: yet I am
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:7277:58"/>
content to heare what you have to ſay, and will give you an anſwere when we can conveniently.</q>
                     <p>So taking the Cardinall by the hand, ſhe brought them into a withdrawing roome, where having at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively heard out their meſſage, ſhee made this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply:</p>
                     <q>That now after twenty yeares the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of my marriage ſhould be questioned, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſufficiently wonder, eſpecially when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der who were the Authours of it: Many of them are yet alive both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spaine:</hi> and what kind of men the reſt were, who are now dead; the world knowes: <hi>Henry</hi> and <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> our Parents the most ſage Princes of their time, and their Counſaile ſuch without doubt, who for their wiſdome were approved of as fit ſervants for ſo iudicious Maſters, beſides the Pope, whoſe Diſpenſation J have to ſhew, and which was procured by my Father at no ſmall rate. But what thing is there ſo ſincere and firme, which enuy will not ſeeke to blaſt. Of theſe my miſeries I can accuſe none but you, my Lord of <hi>Yorke.</hi> Becauſe I could not away with your monstrous pride, exceſsive riot, whoredome, and intolerable oppreſsion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do I now ſuffer. And yet not only for this: for ſome part of your hatred I am beholding to my Nephew the Emperour, whom, for that he did not ſatisfie your inſatiable ambition by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:7277:59"/>
 you to the Papacy, you have ever ſince maligned. You threatned to be revenged on him and his Friends, and you have performed your promiſe; for you have beene the onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendiarie and plotter of all the miſchiefe and wars against him theſe late yeares. And J am his Aunt, whom how you have perſecuted, by raiſing this new doubt, God only knowes, to whoſe iudgement only I commend my cauſe.</q>
                     <p>This Shee ſpake in <hi>French,</hi> as it ſeemed very much moved, and would not endure to heare WOLSEY ſpeake in defence of himſelfe, but courteouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed CAMPEGIVS.</p>
                     <p>It was now <hi>Iune,</hi> and the Harveſt drawing on, the Legates thought it high time to make an end of this ſuite. A day therefore being prefixed, many of the Nobility, and a multitude of the Commonaltie repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Court, verily expecting, that iudgement ſhould have beene given for the King. HENRY (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving I know not how conceived ſome hope of the Legates good intents) cauſed a ſeat to bee placed for himſelfe behind the hangings, vnder the covert wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he might vnſeene heare whatſoever was ſpoken or paſſed in Court. The Cardinals being ſeated, the King's Advocates earneſtly requiring that ſentence might be given on their ſide, CAMPEGIVS made this Oration well beſeeming the conſtancy of a man not vnworthy of the place he ſupplied.</p>
                     <q>
                        <note place="margin">Cardinall <hi>Campegius</hi> his Oration.</note> J have heard and diligently examined what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hath beene alledged in the King's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. And indeed the arguments are ſuch, that I might and ought pronounce for the King, if
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:7277:59"/>
two reaſons did not controll and curbe my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of doing his Matestie right: The Queene (you ſee) withdrawes her ſelfe from the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Court, having before vs excepted against the partialitie of the place, where (ſhe ſaith) nothing can be determined without the conſent of the Plaintife. Moreover his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe (who is the fountaine and life of our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e) hath by a meſſenger given vs to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that hee hath reſerved this cauſe for his owne hearing: ſo that if wee would never ſo faine proceed any farther, peradventure wee cannot, J am ſure wee may not. Wherefore (which only remaineth) I doe heere diſſolve the Court: Other then this (as the caſe ſtands) I cannot do: and I beſeech them, whom this Cauſe concernes, to take in good part what I have done. Which if they will not, although it may trouble me, yet not ſo much, as to reguard the threats of any one. I am a feeble old man, and ſee death ſo neere me, that in a matter of ſo great conſequence neither hope, nor feare, nor any other reſpect, but that of the Supreme Iudge, before whom I finde my ſelfe ready to appeare, ſhall ſway me.</q>
                     <p>How the King was pleaſed at this you may eaſily conceive. It is reported, that the Duke of <hi>Suffolke</hi> knowing the King to be preſent, and conſcious of his infirmitie, in a great rage leaping out of his chaire
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:7277:60"/>
 bountifully beſtowed a volley of curſes vpon the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, ſaying <hi>It was never well with</hi> England, <hi>ſince it had any thing to doe with Cardinalls.</hi> To whom WOLSEY returned a few wordes, ſaying, <hi>That it was not in his power to proceed without Authoritie from the Pope, and that no man ought to accuſe them for not doing that, whereto their power did not extend.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Kings implacable anger admitted of no excuſe: WOLSEY himſelfe muſt become a ſacrifice to appeaſe it. As for CAMPEGIVS, hee taſted nevertheleſſe of the King's bountie, and had leave to depart. But at <hi>Calais</hi> his carriages were ſearched by the King's command. The pretence was, that WOLSEY intending an eſcape, had by CAMPE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GIVS convaied his treaſures for <hi>Rome</hi> But the Bull was the Treaſure ſo much ſought after. The King could not beleive it was burned; and if it were found, it was enough to countenance his ſecond marriage. But found it was not, no nor ſcarce ſo much money in all the Cardinals carriages, as had beene given him by the King.</p>
                     <p>WOLSEY his riſing and his fall were alike ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine; neither of them by degrees, but as the Lion gets his prey, by leapes. Shortly after the departure of his Colleague, vpon the eighteene of <hi>October,</hi> the<note place="margin">

But he pleaded, <hi>That the King had by Patent made him Lord Chancellour during terme of life, and by conſequence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the cuſtodie of the great Seale to him: Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe hee would reſigne his place, if his Maiestie ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. But hee thought it not fit, having received the Seale from the King, to deliver it to any other, but vpon especiall Command.</hi> The Lords returning to <hi>Windſore</hi> where the Court then was, the next day brought the

What CRANMER had as it were let fall by chance they report to the King, who ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly apprehending it, ſaid that this fellow whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver he was, had hit the naile on the head, and withall demanding his name, cauſed CRANMER to be ſent for, whom he commended for his (but too late) ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe, which courſe if he had taken but five yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, hee ſhould now have had an hundred thouſand pounds in his purſe, which he had vnprofitably in this ſuite caſt away on the Court of <hi>Rome:</hi> he commands CRANMER to write a Tract concerning this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherein having drawne together what reaſons hee could for the confirmation of his advice, hee ſhould conclude with his owne opinion. CRANMER did it very readily, and is therevpon with Sir THOMAS BO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEN (lately created Earle of <hi>Wiltſhire)</hi> CARNE, STOKESLEY, and BE NET, Doctours of Law, with others ſent on an Embaſſie to <hi>Rome.</hi> CRANMER'S booke is to be preſented to his Holineſſe, and they are commanded to challenge the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation wherin the Contents of that book ſhould be maintained; the argument whereof was, <hi>That by the authority of holy Scripture, ancient Fathers, and Councels, it was vtterly vnlawfull for any man to marry his Brothers Widow, and that no ſuch marriage could bee licenced or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized, by the Popes Diſpenſation.</hi> This being done, the King's intent was, they ſhould procure the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all the Vniverſities throughout <hi>Europe,</hi> by whom if he found his former marriage condemned,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:7277:66"/>
then without farther expecting the approbation of the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> he was reſolved to run the hazard of a ſecond. To this the amity of the <hi>French</hi> ſeeming ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conducible, the King had by his former liberality ſought to oblige him.

                     <p>While CRANMER thus laboured abroad, the King at home deales with LANGEY the <hi>French</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour, by whoſe meanes (with the forcible Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricke (ſaith one) of ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Angels) hee obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the Vniverſities of <hi>Paris</hi> with the reſt through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>France, Pavia, Padua, Bononia,</hi> and others, this Concluſion, <hi>That the Pope (who hath no power over the Poſitive Law of God) could not by his Diſpenſation ratifie a marriage contracted betweene a Brother and a brothers Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, it being forbidden by the expreſſe words of Scripture.</hi>

                     <p>Shortly after by Act of Parliament the marriage of the King and the Lady CATHARINE was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red void and inceſtuous, and a Law enacted, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all Appeales to <hi>Rome</hi> were forbidden, and that none ſhould ſtile CATHARINE other then Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of <hi>Wales,</hi> and Widow or Dowager of Prince ARTHVR. By vertue and authority of the ſame Law, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> accompanied with ſome other Biſhops, comming to <hi>Dunſtable</hi> ſix miles from <hi>Ampthill,</hi> where CATHARINE then reſided, cauſed her to be cited before Him next vnder the King chiefe Iudge in all Eccleſiaſticall cauſes within the Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to ſhew what reaſons could be alleaged why the marriage not lawfully contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted betweene the King and her ſhould not be diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled, and pronounced impious, inceſtuous, and conſequently void. To theſe things by one of her ſervants ſhe anſwered; that it beſeemed not the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop to thruſt his ſickle into anothers harveſt: this Cauſe did yet depend vndecided before the Pope CHRIST'S Vicar on earth, whoſe Decree ſhe would obey, and other Iudge would ſhee acknowledge none. Being called fifteene dayes together and not appearing. Shee is pronounced <hi>Contumax,</hi> and for her contumacie ſeparated from the Kings bed and company. Wherevpon the Lady ANNE proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Queene throughout the Kingdome, on Eaſter eve ſhewed her ſelfe publiquely as Queene: and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:7277:71"/>

HENRY was certaine of enioying his Love, and let the Pope decree what he liſt, was reſolved to keepe her.

The Biſhop conceiving ſome hopes of a peace (although it were in the winter time) goes himſelfe to <hi>Rome,</hi> gives the Pope an account of his actions, and certifies him that the matter was not yet deſperate. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon a day is appointed by which a Poſt returning from the King was to give notice of an intended Embaſſie. But the Conſiſtory gave ſo ſhort a time to have an anſwere, that the Poſt came ſhort two dayes at his returne. The terme expired, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed haſtily to the confirmation of their Cenſures notwithſtanding the Biſhops inſtance to obtaine ſix dayes more, for as much as contrary windes or ſome other chance might hinder the meſſenger;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7277:72"/>
and ſix dayes would be no great matter, conſidering the King had wauered ſix whole yeares before hee fell: The more moderate thought the Biſhop de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded but reaſon; but the prepoſterous haſte of the greater ſort preuailed. Two dayes were ſcarce paſt after the prefixed time, but the Poſt arriuing with ample authority, and inſtructions from <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> did greatly amaze thoſe haſty Cardinalls, who afterwards would faine, but could not finde any meanes to mend what they had ſo raſhly marred.

                     <p>ABout this time was diſcouered the grand im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſture of ELIZABETH BARTON, which brought her to a deſerued end. Shee had formerly beene ſicke of a ſtrange diſeaſe, which not only afflicted her inwardly, but as often as her fit tooke her, ſo wonderfully diſtorted her mouth and other parts of her body, that moſt were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, it could not peoceed from any naturall cauſe. But Cuſtome growing to a ſecond Nature, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the Diſeaſe had taught her to diſtort her body after her recouery, in the fame manner as when ſhe was ſicke. Hoping to make a profit of this her counterfeit Convulſion, ſhe imparted the ſecret to the Curate of the Pariſh: by whoſe deuice after <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ong deliberation betweene them, it was agreed, that ſhe ſhould often faine her ſelfe to be in an ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſie: and whereas ſhee was wont when the fit ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her, to ly ſtill without motion, as if ſhe had been dead, ſhee ſhould now ſometimes vtter ſome godly ſentences, inveigh againſt the wickedneſſe of the times, but eſpecially againſt Heretiques and broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of new Opinions; and ſhould relate ſtrange viſions revealed by God to her in the time of her ecſtaſie. By theſe jugling trickes, not only among the Vulgar (who termed the <hi>holy Maid of</hi> Kent) but among the wiſer ſort, ſuch as were Archbiſhop WARHAM, Biſhop FISHER, and others, her ſanctity was held in admiration. The Impoſture taking ſo generally, her boldneſſe increaſed. Shee prefixeth a day whereon ſhe ſhall be reſtored to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health, and the meanes of her recouery muſt be
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:7277:73"/>
procured forſooth by a pilgrimage to ſome certaine Image of our Lady. The day came, and ſhee beeing brought to the place, by the like couſenage deceiued a great number of people, whom the expectation of the miracle had drawne thither: and at laſt, as if ſhe had iuſt then ſhaken off her diſeaſe, ſhee appeares whole and ſtraight vnto them all; ſaying, That by eſpeciall command from God ſhee muſt become a Nunne, and that one Doctor BOCKING a Monke of <hi>Canterbury</hi> there preſent, was ordained to bee her Confeſſor, which office hee willingly vndertooke: vnder pretext whereof this Nunne liuing at <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> BOCKING often reſorted to her, not without ſuſpition of diſhoneſty.</p>
                     <p>The intended Divorce from CATHARINE, and marriage with ANNE BOLEN, had much ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palled moſt part of the Clergy: for then a neceſſity was impoſed on the King, of a divorce from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Sea, in which the Church and all Eccleſiaſticall perſons were likely to ſuffer. The apprehenſion whereof wrought ſo with BOCKING, that making others conſcious of the intent, hee perſuaded ELI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ZABETH BARTON by denuntiation of Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed judgements to deterre the King from his purpoſed change. Shee according as ſhee was inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, proclaimes it abroad, That the King aduentu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to marry another, CATHARINE ſurviving, ſhould, if in the meane time hee died not ſome infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous death, within one moneth after be depriued of his Kingdome.

But much more incredible may all wiſe men thinke the vnheard of crime for which ſhee was condemned: <hi>viz.</hi> That fearing leaſt her Daughter the Lady ELIZATETH borne while CATHARINE ſurvived, ſhould bee accompted illegitimate, in hope of other (eſpecially maſle) Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, whereof ſhee deſpaired by the King, now neere fifty yeares old, ſhee had laſciviouſly vſed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of certaine young Courtiers: nay not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with content, had committed inceſt with her owne Brother. A ſtrange ingratitude in one raiſed from ſo low degree, euen to the height of honour. I will not derogate from the Authority of publique Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords: But an Act of Parliament againſt her ſhall not worke on my beliefe. Surely it carried ſo little ſhew of probability with foraine Princes, that they alwaies deemed it an act of inhumane cruelty.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:7277:79"/>
 and vnworthy (as they iudged it) end of the Queene, loathing the King for his inconſtancy and cruelty, they caſt off all farther thought of that matter. I will not preſume to diſcuſſe the truth of their opinion: But freely to ſpeake what I my ſelfe thinke; There are two reaſons which ſway much with mee in the behalfe of the Queene. That her Daughter the Lady ELIZABETH was ſeated in the Royall Throne, where ſhee for ſo many yeares ruled ſo happily and triumphantly. What ſhall we thinke, but that the Divine Goodneſſe was pleaſed to recompence the iuſt calamity of the Mother, in the glorious proſperity of the Daughter? And then conſider but the Kings precipitated Nuptialls the very next day after the death of his former Wife, yet ſcarce interred, and with whoſe warme bloud his imbrued hands yet reaked: conſider this, I ſay, and you ſhall eaſily be perſuaded with mee, that the inſatiable Prince glutted with the ſatiety of one, and out of the deſire of variety ſeeking to enioy ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, did more willingly giue eare to the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous calumnies of the malicious Popelings, than either befitted an vpright Iudge, or a louing huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. For it ſeemeth wonderfull ſtrange to mee, that either the fault of the one, or the pleaſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and faire language of the other Wife, ſhould ſo far poſſeſſe the King, as that hee ſhould procure<note place="margin">Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> diſinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited.</note> his daughter ELIZABETH to be by Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament declared illegitimate, the matrimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with both the former Queenes CATHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RINE and ANNE to be pronounced invalid, and the Crowne to be perpetually eſtabliſhed on the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of the third wife, or if the King had no Iſſue by her, that then it ſhould bee lawfull for him by Will and Teſtament, to transfer it on whome hee
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:7277:79"/>
pleaſed. Parliaments were not then ſo rigid, but that they could flatter the Prince, and condeſcend to his demands, though vniuſt, even in caſes which moſt neerely concerned the publique Weale.

Wherefore they humbly beſeeched his Maieſty, whom they could not ſafely peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnarmed, that the Authours of theſe pernicious counſailes might ſit no longer at the ſterne, but that others who ſhould faithfully

And among the reſt, hee permitted the Archbiſhop of <hi>Dublin</hi> to be murthered in his ſight. The poore Earle already afflicted with a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, was ſo ſtricken to the heart with the newes of this tumult, that hee but a few dayes ſurvived the knowledge of his vnhappineſſe. The King leuying great Forces, quickly curbed the vnruly Youth, and after ſome moneths forced him to yeeld. His Vnkles were either taken, or willingly ſubmitted themſelves. All of them were ſent to <hi>London,</hi> and there brought to their anſwer. There goes a Story, that thoſe three Vnkles who endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine their headſtrong Nephew, did halfe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume on the Kings clemency, vntill in the paſſage demanding of the Maſter the name of the Ship wherein they failed; and vnderſtanding it was called <hi>The Cow,</hi> bethinking themſelves of a certaine Prophecy, <hi>That fiue Sonnes of an Earle ſhould in the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a Cow be carried into</hi> England <hi>neuer to returne;</hi> they forthwith deſpaired of pardon.

Hee then rips vp what tyranny hee had exerciſed over his Subiects of all degrees, in what miſeries hee had plunged this flouriſhing Realme, what dangers he incurred from the Emperour, in reguard of the iniury offered to his Aunt, and the overthrow of Religion, and that hee could not expect any aid either from his owne or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Nations, who had deſerued ſo ill of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Commonwealth. After this, hee whets on the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to revenge the diſhonour of his Family; affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that <hi>Turciſme (meaning the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion)</hi> had found entertainement in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> And after many bitter reproofes, hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites <hi>HENRY</hi> to repentance, perſuading him, That for theſe evills there was no other remedy, but to returne to the boſome of the Church, in the defence whereof (a moſt glorious example) hee had made vſe not onely of his Sword, but his Pen alſo.</p>

Whereof hee having intelligence, did by his Agent earneſtly ſolicite FRANCIS, That in reguard of their mutuall amity, hee would cauſe POOLE to bee apprehended, as
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:7277:86"/>
guilty of high Treaſon, and ſent to him, where hee ſhould vndergo the puniſhment due there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But becauſe Religion and the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had beene violated in betraying any (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Popes)</hi> Embaſſadour, the <hi>French</hi> could not yeeld to the Kings requeſt: but to ſhew that hee would adminiſter no cauſe of offence, hee refuſed to admit of his Embaſſy, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him ſpeedily to depart out of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
                     <p>HERCVLES ſtature might be gueſſed at by the proportion of his foot; and by this one mans endeavours, HENRY was taught what, if need were, hee was to expect of his Clergy.

There were ſome Images of more eſpeciall fame, and Shrines of reputed Saints, Whereunto Pilgrimages were made from the fartheſt parts of the Kingdome, nay even from foraine Countries alſo: the Oblations whereto were ſo many and ſo rich, that they not onely ſuffiſed for the maintenance of Prieſts and Monkes, but alſo to the heaping vp of incredible wealth.

The ſpoile of this Monument, wherein nothing was meaner then gold, filled two cheſts ſo full, that each of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired eight ſtrong men for the portage.

                     <p>Great was the Treaſure which the King raiſed of the ſpoiles of Churches and Religious Houſes. But whether the guilt of ſacriledge (adhering like a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming canker) made this ill gotten treaſure vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, or that he found he had need of greater ſupplies to withſtand the dangers that threatened him from abroad, not content with what hee had already cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raded, hee caſts his eyes on the wealth of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyes that had eſcaped the violence of the former tempeſt: and not expecting (as hee deemed it) a needleſſe Act of Parliament, ſeizeth on the reſt of the Abbeyes and Religious Houſes of the Realme.

 oft informed, That the credulous People were verily perſuaded, that his Maieſty abhorring the Religion of his Anceſtors, had embraced the new Tenets lately broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in <hi>Germany.</hi> True it was, the tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> had beene trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome to his Predeceſſors, but to Him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable, and therefore had Hee ſhaken it off: That Religion might no longer patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize Jdleneſſe, Hee had expelled Monkes, who were no other then Drones in the Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hive: Hee had taken away the idolatrous worſhip of Jmages, had permitted to his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects the reading and knowledge of Gods Word, hither to prohibited by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> leaſt their wiles and couſenages ſhould be diſcovered: and had made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in ſome other things peradventure of leſſe moment, which no man could deny, would much redound to the good both of Church and Common-wealth.

The Commiſſioners begin firſt with the Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> among whom two were more ſtraight laced then the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> RICHARD READ and WILLIAM ROCH: but their parſimony ſhall coſt them deare. For READ being an old man and vtterly vnexpert of Martiall Diſcipline is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſerve in perſon in the wars of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is taken by the <hi>Scots,</hi> and forced to ranſon himſelfe at a high rate.

                     <p>In the meane time <hi>Boloigne</hi> was a great eyeſore to the <hi>French.</hi> They try to regaine it by ſtratagems and ſurpriſals, but in vaine.

The Marſhall of <hi>Biez</hi> Governour of <hi>Boloignois</hi> comes with a great Army to the <hi>Port,</hi> a Towne two miles from <hi>Boloigne,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to build a Fort on this ſide the river vpon the point of the Tower of <hi>Ordre,</hi> but is by the Earle of <hi>Hertford</hi> forced away, and leaves his Caſtle in the Aire. His intent was by this Fort to have kept the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of <hi>Boloigne</hi> within their wals, to have comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the haven, ſo to cut off all ſuccours by ſea, and from <hi>Calais</hi> by land. Which being done, FRANCIS reſolved in Perſon to beſiege <hi>Guiſnes,</hi> and there to

 fortifie, thereby to famiſh <hi>Boloigne,</hi> and to keepe <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lais</hi> and the land of <hi>Oye</hi> in ſubiection. But theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes proving fruitleſſe, he prepares his navall forces, giving forth, that he intended to invade <hi>England,</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that this alarme would have made vs have a care of the maine, and neglect thoſe pieces abroad, ſo that <hi>Boloigne</hi> for lack of aide ſhould eaſily be reduced. The noiſe of an invaſion made HENRY arme, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gathered together a ſufficient Fleet, awaited the Enemie at <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> intent to all occaſions.

forſooth to make that the ſeate of the warre, and there to build three Forts, but the valour of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants made them change their deſigne, and forced them againe to their ſhips. Thus every where affron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their loſſe, without any memorable act they ſet ſaile for <hi>Normandie.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> Fleet conſiſted of a hundred and three ſaile of all ſorts, ours of only ſixtie, ſo that it was no way ſae for vs to incounter them. Some light proffers were made on both ſides, wherein we alwayes came of with the better. As for the <hi>Mary Roſe,</hi> a ſhip which with her loſſe buried Sir GEORGE CAROW the Captaine, and ſeven hundred men; the <hi>French</hi> do well to make vſe of caſualties to their owne glory: But it was not the valour of the <hi>French</hi> or fury of their Cannons that ſunke her, but the ſupine negligence of the Marinets, being wracked in the very haven in the preſence of the King.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Boloigne</hi> was not idle the while. Vpon hope of a Fort to be built by the Marſhall of <hi>Biez,</hi> FRANCIS had made great preparations for an enterprize vpon <hi>Guiſnes.</hi> but was diverted by the death of the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> his younger Sonne, and the loſt hopes of his intended Fort neere <hi>Boloigne,</hi> and having for a while encamped at<note n="*" place="margin">

                        <hi>Mont-Lambert,</hi> retired at laſt toward <hi>Amiens.</hi> The neerneſſe of the Kings Campe at <hi>Mont-Lambert</hi> did daily invite both Nations to make triall of their valour, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſometimes, ſometimes the <hi>French</hi> having the better. One day among the reſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> hotly charging the <hi>French,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male</hi> comes to relieve them, who being ſtrooken with a Lance vnder his right eye, it breakes in pieces and leaves the tronchion halſe a foot within his head. It was a token of an excellent ſpirit in this young No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman, that for ſo rough a charge hee loſt not his ſtirrups, and endured the torture whereto they put him in drawing out the three ſquare head, with ſuch
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:7277:107"/>
 an invincible conſtancy, as if they had picked a thorne from out his finger, and beyond all expectation of the Chirurgians recovered. The victory remained to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Who could not long bragge of it, afterward ſeeking to cut off a Convoy of the Enemies defeated by the <hi>Ringrave</hi> with the loſſe of ſixteene Captaines, and ſeven or eight hundred men. The Earle of <hi>Surrey,</hi> who led them, ſaved himſelfe by flight. And were it not diſcourteſie in vs not to requite the late viſit of the <hi>French?</hi> The Lord Admirall therefore landed ſix thouſand men at <hi>Treport</hi> in <hi>Normandie,</hi> burned the Towne and Abbey with thirtie Ships and a Barke in in the Haven, and returned with the loſſe of only fourteene men.</p>
                     <p>Neither were our imployments leſſe or fewer in <hi>Scotland,</hi> then among the <hi>French. Scotland</hi> had ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enemies at home, that it needed not any abroad. But their homebred diſſentions had cauſed war from vs, and the way to ſet them at peace was, to invade them. In the beginning of <hi>March</hi> Sir RALPH E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERS, by the death of his Father Lord <hi>Evers,</hi> with an Army entred <hi>Scotland,</hi> making all the Countrey deſert about <hi>Iedbury</hi> and <hi>Kelſon.</hi> Thence marching to <hi>Coldingham</hi> fortified the Church and Tower, and leauing a Garriſon there, departed. The Garriſon partly out of couetouſneſſe, partly to diſtreſſe the Enemy if he ſhould lay ſiege to them, pillaged and waſted all the neighbouring Countrey. The Regent according to their expectation beſiegeth the Church with eight thouſand men, and batters it a whole day and a night. But ſudainly, making none of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles partakers of his determinations, whether out of feare to be betraied by his Army, or ſome other cauſe, tooke horſe and paſſed away to <hi>Dunbar,</hi> which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the disbanding of the Army, and the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the beſieged.

They vnderſtand by their Scouts of our approach: and to deceive vs, by the adviſe of WALTER SCOT ſend their horſes to the adioyning hils. Neither indeed was the place ſo advantageous for Horſe as for Foot. The horſes bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked by the Groomes that kept them, did from the hils make ſhew of an Army, and that flying. We advance, as loath to let our enemies eſcape, in the purſuit of whom we vnawares fall among the whole Army not diſorderly flying, but prepared to receive vs. It is not vnuſuall to encounter men: but if Heaven and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements oppoſe vs, how can we hope for victory? Wee finde the number of our adverſe Army great beyond our expectation, the Sun farre declining to the Weſt darted his rayes in our faces, and a violent winde drives the ſmoke of the ſhot into our mouthes, which not onely made the moſt neceſſary ſence vnuſefull, but with a foule ſtench corrupted the aire, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the breathing of the already panting Souldiers. The many advantages give them the victory. Wee leave two hundred in the place, and among them the Lord EVERS; a thouſand are taken, whereof Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man READ was one.</p>
                     <p>A little after this victory, FRANCIS ſent into <hi>Scotland</hi> a ſupply of five hundred <hi>French</hi> Horſe and three thouſand Footmen vnder the command of the Lord of <hi>Lorges</hi> Earle of <hi>Montgomery,</hi> not ſo much to croſſe our attempts againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> as to diſtract our forces, that the violence of them vnited might not at once fall on <hi>France.</hi>

The cogitation of many things (as in the like exigents vſually happeneth) oppreſſed him, and chiefly of his Sonnes nonage, but now entring into his tenth yeare, an age infirme and oportune to treacheries, againſt which he found ſmall proviſion in his friends, having
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:7277:109"/>
none amongſt thoſe on whoſe loyalty hee chiefly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied, of ſo ſufficient eminency, as to vnderprop his weake Eſtate with thoſe ſupporters of Royalty, <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authoritie.</hi> His Brother in law the Duke of <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folke</hi> was lately deceaſed: SEIMOVR the yong Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Vnkle was a man whoſe Goodneſſe was not tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with Severity, and being deſcended of a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more ancient then noble (as having vntill now ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver tranſcended Knighthood) would be ſubiect to contempt. They who more neerly participated of the Bloud Royall, as they any way excelled in Power or Vertue, were the more ſuſpected and hated by him. The Family of the HOWARDS was then moſt flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, the chiefe whereof was THOMAS Duke of <hi>Norfolke,</hi> a man famous for his exploits in <hi>France, Scotland,</hi> and elſewhere, long exerciſed in the ſchoole of Experience, many wayes deriving himſelfe from the Crowne, popular, of great command and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues. But the edge of the old mans diſpoſition made milde and blunted with age, adminiſtred the leſſe cauſe of ſuſpition. Of his eldeſt Sonne HENRY Earle of <hi>Surrey,</hi> the King was certainly iealous, and reſolved to cut him off. Hee had lately in the wars of <hi>France</hi> manifeſted himſelfe heire to the glory of his Anceſtors, was of a ripe wit, and endued with great learning, ſo that Elogy afterwards given to his ſonne HENRY, that <hi>hee was the Learnedſt among the Nobility, and the Noblest among the Learned,</hi> might have as fitly beene applied to him, was very gracious with the people, expert in the Art Military, and eſteemed fit for publique Government. Theſe great Vertues were too great Faults, and for them hee muſt ſuffer. Treaſon is obiected to him, and vpon the ſurmiſe hee and his Father ſent to the Tower. On the thirteenth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> he is arraigned, the chiefe point of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation whereon they inſiſted being, for bearing
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:7277:110"/>
 certaine Armes, which only belonged to the King, and conſequently aſpiring to the Crowne. Of other things hee eaſily acquitted himſelfe, and as for thoſe Armes, he conſtantly affirmed that they hereditarily pertained vnto him: yet notwithſtanding hee would not have preſumed to have borne them, but being warranted by the opinion of the Heralds, who onely were to give iudgement in theſe caſes. The Iudges not approving of his anſwer condemne him, and ſo the Flower of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobilitie is on the nineteenth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> beheaded, the King lying in extremity, and breathing his laſt in Bloud. The Duke was adiudged to perpetuall impriſonment, where he continued vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he was by Queene MARY ſet at libertie.</p>
                     <p>The King, his diſeaſe growing on him, at laſt makes his Will, wherein (by vertue of a Law lately enacted) hee ordaines Prince EDWARD his Suceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſour in the firſt place, and in the ſecond (Prince ED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WARD dying iſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Theſe three raigned ſucceſſiuely, and accompliſhed the number of fiftie ſix yeares, at the expiration where of Queene ELIZABETH ended her long glorious Raine, and left the Diadem to King IAMES, in the many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards of his Learning, Religion, Goodneſſe, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and happy Raigne the Mirrour of late ages.

An adviſe not very acceptable to him. But finding it grounded vpon the iudgement of the Phyſicians, hee ſubmitted himſelfe to the hard law of neceſſitie, and reflecting vpon the courſe of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:7277:111"/>
his Life (which hee much condemned) he profeſſed himſelfe confident, that through <hi>Chriſt</hi> his infinite Goodneſſe all his ſinnes, although they had beene more in number and waight, might bee pardoned. Being then demanded whether he deſired to confer with any Divines; <hi>With no other</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop</hi> CRANMER, <hi>and not with him as yet; I will firſt repoſe my ſelfe a little, and as I then finde my ſelfe will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine accordingly.</hi> After the ſleepe of an houre or two finding himſelfe fainting, hee commanded the Archbiſhop (then at <hi>Croydon)</hi> ſhould be ſent for in all haſt. Who vſing all poſſible ſpeed came not vntill the King was ſpeechleſſe. As ſoone as he came, the King tooke him by the hand, the Archbiſhop exhorting him to place all his hope in Gods Mercies through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and beſeeching him, that if hee could not in words, he would by ſome ſigne or other teſtifie this his Hope: Who then wringed the Archbiſhops hand as hard as he could, and ſhortly after expired, having lived fiftie five yeares and ſeven moneths, and thereof raigned thirty ſeven yeares nine monethes and ſix dayes.</p>
                     <p>Thus ended HENRY the Eighth his Life and Raigne, which for the firſt yeares of his Government was like NERO'S Five yeares, Admirable: for often Victories and happy Succeſſe in war, Glorious: for the many Changes vnder it, Memorable: For the Foundation of the Churches Reformation, Lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: to Queenes, moſt vnhappy: for the Death of ſo many (for the moſt) great Perſonages, Bloudy: and for the frequent Exactions and Subſidies, and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious Spoile of the Church, much Preiudiciall to the Eſtate, Grievous and Burthenſome to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.</p>

Wee at length re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:7277:115"/>
 not to dally with them, but to vndertake the war with forces agreeable to the cauſe. The Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> by conſent of the Privie Counſaile is ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Scotland</hi> with ten thouſand Foot and ſix thouſand Horſe (beſide pioners and artificers thirteene hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred) and fifteene peeces of braſſe Ordnance. To the Lord CLINTON is aſſigned a Navy conſiſting of foure and twenty men of war, one Galley, and thirty Ships of burthen, wherewith hee was to ſcowre the Seas, and infeſt the maritime parts of <hi>Scotland.</hi> On the third of <hi>September</hi> the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> made an hoſtile entrance vpon the Enemies Countrey, and forthwith diſpatched letters to the Earle of <hi>Arren,</hi> Regent of <hi>Scotland,</hi> much to this effect: <hi>That he wiſhed the</hi> Scots <hi>would conſider, that this war was waged among Christians, &amp; that our ends were no other then a iuſt Peace, whereto the endevours of all good men ſhould tend. An oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion not only of a League, but of a perpetuall Peace was now happily offred, if they would ſuffer the two differing and emulous Nations by vniting the Head to grow toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

Iealouſy, Envy, and Ambition infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Furies, had armed them againſt each other, and the Pride of the Feminine Sex prepared them for the Liſts. A lamentable exigent, wherein the loſſe of his Adverſary muſt be the deſtruction of each; wherein the Kingdome muſt groane at the loſſe of one, both being in the Eſtate incompatible: wherin the King himſelfe muſt (as moſt ſuſpect he did) ſuffer, that he might not ſuffer. THOMAS SEIMOVR Lord Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall had married CATHARINE PARR the Widow of the deceaſed King. What correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence there might be betweene Her (who had beene the Wife of the late Soveraigne) and the Ducheſſe of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> whoſe Husband being Protector of the Realme, in point of command little differed from a Soveraigne, and had over his Brother the Admirall the advantages of Age, Dignity, and generall Eſteeme, if any man cannot without difficulty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture, I refer him to the firſt booke of HERODI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AN, where let him obſerve the contentions ariſing betweene CRISPINA the Wife of COMMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DVS, and LVCILLA, who had beene formerly married to L. VERVS the Emperour. But in this the divers diſpoſitions of the Brothers ſet on edge on the emulous humors of their Wives. The Duke was
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:7277:121"/>
 milde, affable, free, open, and no way malicious: the Admirall was naturally turbulent, fierce, ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and conceived himſelfe to be of the two the fitter for publique government. Preſently after the death of HENRY, the Admirall thruſt on by the flattery of his overweening conceits, reſolved to ad a luſtre to his good parts, by marrying the Lady ELIZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BETH, as yet indeed ſcarce marriageable. But the Protector wiſely conſidering how raſh and perilous this proiect was, fruſtrated that deſigne. By his after marriage with CATHARINE a moſt beautifull and noble Lady, and aboundiug with wealth befit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her dignity, moſt men were confident, that the gulfe of his vaſt deſires would have beene ſatisfied; but the Law wherby he was condemned (though peradventure enacted by ſtrength of Faction) will manifeſt the contrary. What notice I have received, and what the publique Records teſtify concerning this, being perſuaded, that they ſwarve not much from the truth, I thinke I may without blame relate. The Admirall having now fortified himſelfe with money and friends, and deeming his Brothers Leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Sluggiſhneſſe; began to behold him with the eye of contempt, and to caſt about how to diſpoſſeſſe him of the ſaddle, and (being of like degree of conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity to the King) to enioy the ſeat himſelfe.

Nay his madneſſe ſo far tranſported him, that to one of them, conditionally that his aſſiſtance were not wanting to the advancement of his deſignes, he promiſed that the King ſhould marry his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In the meane time the Queene his Wife being in <hi>September</hi> delivered of a Daughter, died in childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, and that not without ſuſpicion of poiſon.

                     <p>POOLE himſelfe having thus put off the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the <hi>French</hi> Cardinalls began to alledge, That in reguard of the difficulties of wayes and diſtance of places, many of the Colledge were yet abſent, and that there was no reaſon why they ſhould with ſuch precipitation proceed to a partiall Election before the Conclave were full.

him. For the Conſpiracy he was by his owne confeſſion condemned, and that by vertue of a Law enacted 3.

But howſoever the Law (enacted as ſome conceive vpon ſomewhat differing intents and meaning) were extended to the higheſt of it's rigour, yet can I not but wonder, how a man ſo great in the reguards of his Reigning Nephew, of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, of the popular Favour, ſhould be ſo deſtitute of Learned Advice, as not to exempt himſelfe from a felonious death by his <hi>Clergy.</hi> But ſuch were the times, ſuch his misfortunes in the minority of his Prince; from whoſe revengefull hand how could the adverſe Faction preſume themſelves ſecure in the future?

But certain halberdiers appointed to guard the Duke to the ſcaffold; but comming tardy, &amp; crying to their fellows, <hi>Away, away,</hi> were more probably the occaſion of this tumult. The true meaning of this amphibolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall word, which commandeth haſte <hi>to</hi> and <hi>from,</hi>
                        <pb n="251" facs="tcp:7277:133"/>
being miſtaken, and withall a company of armed men bending themſelves (as was ſuppoſed) againſt the multitude, filled all with terror and confuſion. The affrighted people being at length with much ado pacified; the Duke entreating them for a while to containe themſelves, that he might with a more ſetled minde depart out of this world; by prayer commended his ſoule to God, and then ſuffered with admirable conſtancy, neither by voice, geſture, nor countenance ſhewing himſelfe any way deiected or moved at the apprehenſion of death, vnles peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture you might take this for a token of feare, that when he covered his eyes with his handkerchiefe, his cheekes had a little more tincture of red then vſuall.</p>
                     <p>That his death was generally lamented, is manifeſt. Many there were who kept handkerchiefes dipped in his bloud, as ſo many ſacred Reliques. Among the reſt a ſprightfull Dame two yeares after, when the Duke of <hi>Northumberland</hi> was led captive through the City for his oppoſition againſt Queene MARY, ran to him in the ſtreets, and ſhaking out her bloudy handkerchief before him, <hi>Behold</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>the bloud of that worthy man, that good Vnkle of that excellent King, which ſhed by thy treacherous machination, now at this inſtant begins to revenge it ſelfe vpon thee.</hi> And Sir RALPH VANE, who on the twenty ſixt of <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary</hi> was with Sir MILES PARTRIDGE han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at the ſame place where the Duke had ſuffered, at what time alſo Sir MICHAEL STANHOP and Sir THOMAS ARVNDELL were there behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, going to his execution ſaid, that <hi>His bloud would make</hi> Northumberland's <hi>pillow vneaſy to him.</hi> Theſe foure Knights being to be executed, did each of them take God to witneſſe, that they never practiſed any thing againſt the King nor any of his Counſaile.</p>
                     <p>To returne to the Duke, ſuch was his end. As for
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:7277:134"/>
 his life, he was a pious juſt man, very zealous in point of Reformation, very ſollicitous of the King's ſafety, every way good, and carefull of the Weale publique, only a little tainted with the Epidemique of thoſe times, who thought it Religion to reforme the Church, as well in it's exuberancy of <hi>meanes,</hi> as of ſuperſtitious <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> wherof not a few of our Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedralls to this day complaine.</p>
                     <p>Many prodigies enſued his death, wherby many did preſage the calamities of ſucceeding times. In <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> ſix Dolphins (a fiſh ſeldome ſeene in our ſeas) were taken in the <hi>Thames,</hi> three neere <hi>Quinborough,</hi> and three a little above <hi>Greenwich,</hi> where the water is ſcarce tainted with the Seas brackiſhneſſe.

But what hopefull Prince was there ever (almoſt) immaturely taken away, but poiſon or ſome other treachery was imputed? Our deluded hopes being converted into griefe, out of paſſion we bely Fate. Had there beene the leaſt ſuſpition of any ſuch inhumane practiſe, Queene MARY would never have ſuffered it to have paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as an act of indifferency without an inqueſt. It was doubtleſſe a poſthumous rumor purpoſely rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make the Great Ones of that Raigne diſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the ſucceeding times. Howſoever it were, the Nobility vnderſtanding by the Phyſitions, that the King's eſtate was deſperate, began every one to proiect his owne ends. The Duke of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> as he was more potent than the reſt, ſo did his ambition fly higher. It was ſomewhat ſtrange, that being not any way able to pretend but a ſhadow of Right to the Crowne, he ſhould dreame of confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Succeſſion of it in his Family. But he ſhall ſore ſo high, that he ſhall ſinge his wings, and fall no leſſe dangerouſly than he whome the Poêts feigne to have aſpired to a like vnlawfull governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

 two obſtacles to be removed, he doubted not by reaſons drawne from their queſtionable Births to exclude them. The next reguard muſt be of the Daughters of HENRY the Seventh. But of the Queene of <hi>Scots</hi> (who was Niepce to MAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GARET the eldeſt Daughter of HENRY the Seventh) he was little ſollicitous. For by reaſon of our continuall enmity with the <hi>Scots,</hi> and thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate hatred, he imagined that any ſhew of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon would put her by, eſpecially ſhee being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the <hi>French,</hi> whoſe inſolent government hee was confident the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would never brooke. In the next place conſideration is to be had of Lady FRANCIS Daughter to CHARLES BRAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DON Duke of <hi>Suffolke</hi> by MARY Dowager of <hi>France</hi> the ſecond Daughter of HENRY the Seventh, who, her two Brothers then alive, had beene married to HENRY GRAY Marquis of <hi>Dorſet.</hi> The two Brothers (as before) dying of the late mortality, the Marquis is in the right of his Wife created Duke of <hi>Suffolke;</hi> and this was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtop to his Ambition. For the removall whereof he intends this courſe: He imparts his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes to the Duke of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> and deſires that a Match may be concluded betweene the Lord GVILFORD DVDLEY his fourth Sonne, and Lady IANE GREY the Duke of <hi>Suffolke's</hi> eldeſt Daughter. And becauſe, if onely right of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance ſhould be pretended, the Ducheſſe of <hi>Suffolke</hi> were in reaſon to be preferred before her Daughter; he vndertakes to perſuade the King not only to diſherit his Siſters by Will and Teſtament, but alſo by the ſame to declare the Lady IANE his next and immediate Succeſſor. <hi>Suffolke</hi> biting at this bait, they complot by drawing the chiefeſt of the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:7277:135"/>
Nobility, to contract Affinity either with the one or tother to procure the generall aſſent of them all. So on the ſame day that Lady IANE vnder anvn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Planet was married to Lord GVILFORD, the Duke of <hi>Suffolk's</hi> two youngeſt Daughters are married, CATHARINE to Lord HENRY el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt ſonne to the Earle of <hi>Pembrooke,</hi> and crouch backed MARY to MARTIN KEYES Groome Porter. <hi>Northumberlands</hi> eldeſt Daughter alſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med CATHARINE was married to the Lord HASTINGS eldeſt ſonne to the Earle of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington.</hi> Theſe marriages were in <hi>Iune</hi> ſolemnized at <hi>London,</hi> the King at that time extremely languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Hauing thus brought theſe things to a deſired paſſe, nothing now remained but to act his part with the weake King. To Him he inculcates,</hi> In what danger the estate of the Church would be, if He dying, proviſion were not firſt made of a pious Succeſſour, and ſuch a one as ſhould maintaine the now establiſhed Religion. How the Lady <hi>MARY</hi> ſtood affected was well knowne. Of the Lady <hi>ELIZABETH</hi> there might be peraduenture better hopes. But their cauſes were ſo ſtrongly connexed, that either both muſt be excluded, or the Lady <hi>MARY</hi> be admitted. That it was the part of a religious and good Prince to ſet apart all reſpects of Bloud, where <hi>God's</hi> Glory and the Subiects weale might be indangered. They that ſhould do otherwiſe, were after this life (which is ſhort) to exſpect revenge at <hi>God's</hi> dreadfull Tribunall, where they are to vndergo the tryall either of eternall life or eternall death. That the Duke of <hi>Suffolke,</hi> had three Daughters neerest to him in degrees of Bloud: they were ſuch as their Vertues and Birth did commend, and from whome the violation of Religion, or the danger of a forraine yoke by any match was not to be

 feared, for aſnuch as their education had beene Religious, they had as it were with their milke ſuckt in the ſpirituall food of true Christian Doctrine, and were alſo matched to Husbands as zealous of the Truth as themſelves; He could wiſh and would adviſe, that theſe might be ſucceſsively called to the Crowne, but with this caution, <hi>That they ſhould maintaine the now eſtabliſhed Religion.</hi> And although Lady <hi>IANE</hi> the eldeſt of the three were married to his Sonne; he would be content that they ſhould be bound by oath to performe whatſoever his Maieſty ſhould decree: for he had not ſo much reguard to his owne as the generall good.</p>

This Will was read in preſence of the Counſaile and the chiefe Iudges of the Realme, and by each of them confirmed, with a ſtrict command that no man ſhould publiſh the contents of it, leaſt it might prove an occaſion of ſedition and civill tumults. The Archbiſhop CRANMER did for a while refuſe to ſubſcribe to it, not deeming it any way agreeable to equity, that the right of lawfull Succeſſion ſhould vpon any pretences be violated: But the King vrging him, and making Religion a motive, which was otherwiſe likely to ſuffer, after a long deceptation he was at length drawne to aſſent. But theſe delaies of his were ſo little reguarded by Queene MARY, that vnder her ſcarce any man was ſooner marked out for deſtruction.

                     <p>But an vnexpected accident did moſt advantage Queene MARYES affaires. Six ſhips had <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> ſet forth on that part of the Kingdome, where it is confined with the <hi>German</hi> Ocean, that he might intercept the Queene, if ſhee ſought to make an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, and to have them readie for all occaſions.

The mariners and ſouldiers induced partly by threats, partly by intreatie, yeild the ſhips to Sir HENRY IERNEGAM for Queene MARYES vſe, and aſſociate themſelues with the new raiſed companies. This was to her a matter of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and that ſuch ſhe deemed it, her ioy well te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified.

But they muſt either make the way, or be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to pray only for her, whom they could not otherwiſe advantage. It happened that <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> had written for more aides.

The Lords that favoured MARIES cauſe laying hold on this occaſion, obſequiouſly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring their ſervices for the furtherance of the Dukes deſignes, decree ſpeedie aides for him; but pretend, that it were dangerous to imploy any other in theſe levies, then ſuch of whoſe loyalty they might reſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, leaſt the like treacherie might be committed as had beene already by Sir EDWARD HASTINGS; and profer themſelues for the execution of this affaire.

The Earle of <hi>Warwicke</hi> finding that the Iudges in ſo great a cauſe admitted not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe of age, with great reſolution heard his condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation pronounced, craving only this favour, that, whereas the goods of thoſe who are condemned for treaſon, are totally confiſcated, yet her Maieſty would be pleaſed, that out of them his debts might be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged. After this, they were all againe returned to the Tower.

 the Aſſembly, <hi>That they ſhould embrace the Religion of their forefathers reiecting that of later date, which had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned all the miſeries of the forepaſſed thirty yeares: and for prevention for the future, if they deſired to preſent their ſoules vnspotted to God, and were truly affected to their Countrey, they ſhould expell thoſe trumpets of ſedition, the Preachers of the Reformed Religion: As for himſelfe, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he might pretend, his conſcience was fraught with the Religion of his Fathers, and for teſtimony hereof he appealed to his great friend the Biſhop of</hi> Wincheſter: <hi>but being blinded with ambition, hee had beene contented to make wracks of his conſcience by temporizing, for which hee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed himſelfe ſincerely repentant, and acknowledged the deſert of his death.</hi> Having ſpoken thus much, he cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the charitable devotions of the Aſſembly, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending his ſoule to God, prepared his body for the ſtroake of the axe. This recantation did variouſly affect the mindes of the multitude, who wondred that he ſhould at laſt apoſtatize from that Religion which he had for ſixteene yeares profeſſed, and in favour whereof chiefly, he perſuaded King EDWARD to endeavour the excluſion of his Siſters from their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Succeſſion. Some write, that being deſirous of life, hee did it craftily out of hope of impunity: but that hope being fruſtrated, to have repented it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. He was ſuſpected (neither were the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſmall) to have adminiſtred a poiſonous potion to King EDWARD: but in his Inditement there was no mention of it, and that the rather, for that the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges had authority only to inflict puniſhment on him for his conſpiracy againſt the Queene.

It is reported, that King HENRY having determined to puniſh his Daughter the Lady MARY with impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment for her contumacy, was by the ſole interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of CRANMER diverted from his reſolutions: And when ſhe was by her Brother King EDWARD to be diſinherited, the Archbiſhop made a long ſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory Oration to the contrary; neither could he be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſubſcribe to the Decree, vntill the Iudges of the Realme generally affirming, that it might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be done, the dying King with much importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie prevailed with him.

It was now bruited, that with his fortune CRANMER had alſo changed his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, inſomuch that to gratifie the Queene, hee had promiſed to celebrate the Exequies of the deceaſed King after the <hi>Romiſh</hi> manner. To cleere himſelfe of this imputation, hee by writing declares himſelfe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to maintaine the Articles of Religion ſet forth by his meanes vnder King EDWARD his Raigne, to be conſonant to the Word of God and the Doctrine of the Apoſtles: in which reſolution he being confirmed by PETER MARTYR, required him for his Second in this religious Duell. But words are not regarded where violence is intended. His death was abſolutely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; but how it might be fairely contrived, was not yet reſolved. Firſt therefore they deale with him as a Traitor. And having for ſome while continued priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the Tower, to alienate the minds of the people who held him in high eſteeme, he is on the thirteenth<note place="margin">The Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> Lady <hi>Iane,</hi> Lord <hi>Guilford</hi> &amp; Lord <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> of <hi>November</hi> together with the Lords AMBROSE and GVILFORD DVDLEY, and Lady IANE, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for treaſon.

And the Cardinall being now in his fiftieth and third yeare, was deemed a little too old to be a father of childen.

But he nothing daunted with their proceedings ſent a Herald to proclaime pardon to ſuch as forſaking WIAT, ſhould returne to their obedience, reſolving withall to force the bridge and gaine entrance into the Citie.

But God is the Protector of Princes, who more eſpecially are his Images and Lieutenants; ſo that the practiſes of Rebels and Traitors againſt their lawfull Soveraignes ſeldome prove ſucceſſefull. WIAT had (not improbably) beene maſter of his deſires, had not God by an vnexpected accident re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded him, or rather ſo blinded him, that by vnneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary delaies he overſlipped his opportunity.

In remounting this piece ſome howers were loſt, notwithſtanding their perſuaſions who adviſed him not to neglect more reall advantages, as indeed he did: for by this meanes he came ſhort of the time prefixed by thoſe Citizens who were fautors of his cauſe. The conſideration wherof made many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire of ſucceſſe and relinquiſh him, ſo that his army was quickely contracted to a ſmaller groſſe. Among the reſt Sir GEORGE HARPER partaker of all WIATS ſtratagems, that he might wipe away the ſtaines of Rebellion and his diſſembled revolt by a loyall treachery, poſted away to the Queene, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed the whole <hi>ſeries</hi> of WIATS proiects.

WIAT hearing that the Earle of <hi>Pembroke</hi> was in armes, betooke himſelfe to a flower march, leaſt he ſhould be forced againſt theſe freſh ſouldiers to oppoſe his panting weary ones. So by noone he approched the ſuburbs, and planting his

                     <p>Having ſpoken thus much, and implored God's mercy, by the helpe of her Gentlewoman ſhe firſt diſrobed her ſelfe of her gowne, then her attire, and vailing her eyes with her handkerchief, laied her head on the blocke, and exhorted the lingring Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioner to the performance of his office, which he at length did, his action drawing teares from the eyes of the ſpectators, yea even of thoſe, who from the very beginning were affected to Queene MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIE'S Cauſe. This was the end of IANE, a Lady renouned for the greatneſſe of her birth, but

 time, and in the opinion of many was thought a fit Husband for the Queene) arrived in <hi>England.</hi> Having beene put beſide the Papacy by others de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault more then his owne, craving leave of the new Pope IVLIVS, he withdrew himſelf to a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in the territory of <hi>Verona</hi> called <hi>Maguzano,</hi> the Religious whereof were <hi>Benedictine</hi> Monkes, of which Order hee himſelfe while hee continued at <hi>Rome</hi> had beene Patron. Having decreed there to hide himſelfe and ſpend the remainder of his dayes, the fame of King EDWARD'S death and Queene MARY'S advancement to the Crowne, drew him againe out of the Cloiſter to <hi>Rome.</hi> He was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant how MARY ſtood affected to the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> and therefore hoped (not without good cauſe) that IVLIVS, who much favoured him having by his delaies attained the Papacy, would ſend him into his Countrey with the honorable title and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Legate. And now he fained to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a double hope of a Kingdome, if not ſecular, at leaſt Eccleſiaſticall, by vertue of his authority Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatine and the dignity of Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Queene MARY had her education for ſome yeares vnder MARGARET Counteſſe of <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> the Mother of POOLE (who was then a childe) and that by Queene CATHARINES meanes, who intended (as it was thought) to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry her Daughter the Lady MARY to one of the Counteſſes Sonnes, thereby to ſtrengthen her Daughters claime to the Crowne, if it ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that HENRY ſhould deceaſe without other law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full iſſue, the Counteſſe being Daughter to GEORGE Duke of <hi>Clarence,</hi> who was brother to EDWARD the Fourth. The Cardinall, whether for this or ſome other reaſons, knowing himſelfe to be in
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:7277:161"/>
deere eſteeme with the Queene, was confident if not of the Crowne by marriage, yet at leaſt of all advantages of her favour. Neither was he therein deceived; for MARY having obtained the Crowne, earneſtly ſued vnto him to reſtore him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to his Countrey; and the Pope, not ignorant how much he would advantage the Apoſtolique Sea, at the Queenes requeſt diſpatched him with moſt ample authority. But the Emperour having a proiect on foot for his Sonne, was ſomewhat jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of the Cardinall: and therefore began ſeriouſly to treat with Cardinall DANDINO the Popes Legat with him, for the concluſion of a Peace betweene him and the <hi>French,</hi> that ſo he might give a ſtop to POOLE, whoſe comming into <hi>England,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors affaires being not yet ſetled, might perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture make all fly aſunder. DANDINO to gratify CHARLES, by FRANCISCO COMMENDONO ſends Letters to POOLE, adviſing him not to ſet forth as yet, foraſmuch as this Legacy vndertaken without the Emperours conſent, was diſpleaſing; and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation for the moſt part, eſpecially the <hi>Londoners,</hi> did ſo hate the name of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> that his Legacy would be held in contempt among them: a Legate therfore was not to be emploied vnto them, vntill perſuaſions had brought them to a better temper. POOLE having received theſe letters in his Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, thought it fitting to expect his Holineſſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. The Pope not brooking the increaſe of the Emperors greatnes by the addition of ſuch Eſtates, and fretting that DANDINO had preſumed to ſtay the Cardinall, recalled DANDINO, and conferred on POOLE alone the Legacy both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>England</hi> for the one affaire, and to the Emperour
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:7277:162"/>
 and the <hi>French</hi> for the treaty of a Peace. He willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vndertaking it, preſently ſet forward from <hi>Trent,</hi> certifying the Emperour and the <hi>French</hi> of his large Commiſſion. The Emperour perceiving that theſe deviſes would be no longer availeable, ſent <hi>Don</hi> IVAN <hi>de Mendoza</hi> vnto him with letters, wherin he plainly diſcovered his feare, that the Cardinalls premature arrivall in <hi>England</hi> might prove an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to his proceedings there, which were great and hopefull: wherfore it was his deſire, that hee ſhould either there attend his pleaſure, or if hee would needs go further he might come to <hi>Liege,</hi> and there expect the event of his deſignes. The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall vpon receipt of theſe letters returnes to <hi>Dilling,</hi> (not far from <hi>Trent)</hi> certifies his Holineſſe of the whole carriage of the buſineſſe, and ſends expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory letters to the Emperor, ſhewing therin what an indignity it was to the Apoſtolique Sea, that his Holineſſe Legat ſent vpon a treaty of Peace, and to reduce a Kingdome to the obedience of the Church, ſhould ſo diſgracefully, with contempt to his Holineſſe, and that by the Emperours com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, be detained in the middeſt of <hi>Germany</hi> in the ſight of the enemies of the Church. That great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine DOMINGO SOTO Ordinary Preacher to the Emperour was then at <hi>Dilling.</hi> By him hee perſuades the Emperour not to hinder this Legati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being it would ſo much hazard the eſtate of the Church, but eſpecially of the Kingdome of <hi>England.</hi> At length with much ado, and that not vntill the Emperour had intelligence, that the Articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Sonnes marriage were agreed on, hee obtained leave to come to <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> but on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that he ſhould there reſide vntill the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour were aſſured, that the marriage betweene

PHILIP aad MARY were ſolemniſed. So to <hi>Bruſſells</hi> he came, where having ſaluted the Emperor, who received him very courteouſly, and that time might not paſſe vnprofitably, with him he begins to put in execution one part of his Legation, which was, to draw the Emperor and the King of <hi>France</hi> to ſome indifferent termes of peace. The Emperor profeſſing, that he would not reiect peace vpon any reaſonable conditions, the Cardinall goes into <hi>France,</hi> to treat with HENRY concerning the ſame thing: who made as faire ſhewes as did the Emperour; but their mindes exulcerated with inveterate hate, made all his paines fruitleſſe. HENRY at his departure em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing him, ſignified the ſorrow he had conceived, that he had not ſooner occaſion to be acquainted with his worth: for had he truly knowne him, his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſhould have beene totally for his advancement to the Papacy.</p>
                     <p>A little after his returne to <hi>Bruſſells,</hi> came the Lords <hi>Paget</hi> and <hi>Haſtings</hi> Embaſſadors to the Emperour from their Maieſties of <hi>England,</hi> who ſignified their joint longing to ſee the Cardinall, and therefore deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he might be forthwith diſmiſſed, that by vertue of his authority he might rectify the Church of <hi>England</hi> wonderfully out of tune by reaſon of the Schiſme wherwith it had beene afflicted. So in <hi>September</hi> hee had leave to go for <hi>England,</hi> but was by contrary windes detained at <hi>Calais</hi> vntill <hi>November,</hi> in which moneth he at length arrived at <hi>Dover.</hi> His entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was moſt honorable, the Kings and Nobles alike ſtriving to manifeſt their joy. And becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the yeare 1539. by Parliament declared Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Eſtate, and by the ſame Law condemned to dy; the Eſtates then aſſembled in Parliament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed that Act, and reſtored him to his Bloud, the Kings themſelves comming to the Houſe extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily

Wherefore he exhorted them ingenuouſly to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the errors of theſe later yeares, and to deteſt them, with ſincere alacrity of minde to accept of, and retaine this benefit, which God by his Vicar's Legate did proffer them. For now nothing elſe remained, but that hee being preſent with thoſe Keyes which ſhould open the gates of the Church, they ſhould alſo abrogate thoſe Lawes, which late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enacted to the preiudice of the Church, had rended them from the reſt of it's Body.</hi>

But many of the lower Houſe, who deemed it a rare feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to have ſhaken off the yoke of <hi>Rome,</hi> eagerly

withſtood the re-admittance of it. But by the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the King and Queene all things were at laſt compoſed to the Cardinalls liking. The authority<note place="margin">The Realme freed from Interdiction.</note> which the <hi>Popes</hi> heretofore vſurped in this Realme is reſtored, the title of <hi>Supreme Head of the Church</hi> is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated, &amp; a Petition drawne by the whole Court of Parliament, for the Abſolution of the People and Clergy of <hi>England</hi> from Schiſme and Hereſy is by the Biſhop of <hi>Winchester</hi> preſented to the Legate, who (they all kneeling) by the authority committed vnto him abſolved them. This being done, they went to the Chappell in Proceſſion ſinging <hi>Te Deum,</hi> and the next Sunday the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> in his Sermon at <hi>Pauls-Croſſe</hi> made a large relation of what had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things being thus ſetled, the Queene in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends an honorable Embaſſy to <hi>Rome,</hi> wherof ſhe had at her firſt comming to the Crowne made promiſe. For having reſolved to replant the Religion of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhe had privily written to POOLE, requiring his advice therin. The Pope was therefore pleaſed to ſend into <hi>England</hi> GIOVANNI FRANCISCO COMMENDONO his Chamberlaine (afterward Cardinall) for the more perfect notice of the eſtate of the Realme. To him the Queene after much privat conference did vnder her hand promiſe obedience to the Sea of <hi>Rome,</hi> deſiring withall, that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome might be abſolved from the Interdict, for the obtaining wherof ſhe would by a ſolemne Embaſſy petition his Holineſſe as ſoone as the Eſtate was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. So now about the end of this yeare the Biſhop of <hi>Ely,</hi> Sir ANTHONY BROWNE, and ED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WARD CARNE Doctor of Law, are by the Kings ſent to proffer their obedience to the Sea of <hi>Rome.</hi> But theſe coſts and paines were fruitleſſe. For before they came to <hi>Rome</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> was dead. In the meane
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:7277:164"/>
 time the Queene conſidering all her actions hitherto to have paſſed with full applauſe, began to treat with the Nobility, to condiſcend, that if not the Royall, at leaſt the matrimoniall Crowne of our Queenes might be impoſed on PHILIP. But it being a matter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out precedent, and that might perchance to an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Prince give ſome colour for claime to the Kingdome, they proved averſe, and ſhee content to ſurceaſe.</p>
                     <p>The next care was of reſtitution of Church lands. But HENRY had ſo divided them, and that among the Nobility, that nothing could be done therein. Only it was decreed, that the Firſt-Fruits and Tenths granted to the King by the Clergy <hi>Anno</hi> 1534, ſhould be remitted: which Decree vpon conſideration of the Treaſuries poverty, and of the many Penſions gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by HENRY to the eiected Religious Perſons, was quickly revoked.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">The Queene thought to be with childe.</note> About the ſame time an abſurd (I might ſay ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous) accident happened by the Queens owne cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity and the flattery of fawning Courtiers. By rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a diſeaſe, which Phyſitians terme a <hi>Mole,</hi> her belly began to ſwell: and ſome other reaſons giving her cauſe to coniecture that ſhe was with childe, ſhee not entertaining the advice of any Phyſitians, but of Mid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>wives and old women, beleeving what ſhe deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſhould be, affirmed that ſhe felt the ſtirring of the <hi>Embryo</hi> in her wombe. To thoſe that are affected with this malady, that fleſhy and informe ſubſtance which is termed <hi>Mola,</hi> doth ſeeme ſometimes to move, but that ſlowly, and with the generall motion of the whole belly.

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:7277:164"/>
FVCHSIVS and other Phyſitians write, doth vſually happen. But theſe flattering hopes betraied her to the laughter of the world, and to her grave. For on the ſeven and twentieth of <hi>November</hi> the Lords of the Counſaile ſent ſome Mandates to the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> to diſperſe certaine formes of Praiers, wherein after thankes given to God for his Mercies to this Kingdome, by giving hopes of an Heire to the Crowne, and infuſing life into the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo,</hi> they ſhould pray for the preſervation of the Queene and the Infant, and her happy delivery, and cauſe <hi>Te Deum</hi> to be ſung every where. Then by Parliament many things were enacted concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the education of the Babe; and much clutter was otherwiſe kept about preparatious for the Childes ſwadling clouts, cradle, and other things requiſite at the Delivery; vntill in <hi>Iune</hi> in the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yeare it was manifeſted, that all was little better then a dreame.</p>

                           </gap>ter</hi> being dead, Cardinall POOLE as yet the Pope's Legate appointed IAMES BROOKE Biſhop of <hi>Gloueester</hi> for CRANMER'S triall, foraſmuch as they iudged it vnlawfull to puniſh an Archbiſhop but by leave from his Holineſſe. IOHN STORY, and THOMAS MARTIN Doctours of Law Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners for the Queene, accompanied the Biſhop to <hi>Oxford,</hi> that the Authority Royall might countenance the Delegates proceeding. In Saint <hi>Maries</hi> Church, they had high ſeates purpoſely erected for them, BROOKE ſitting vnder the place, where the conſe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>crated Hoſt did vſually hang in a Pixe, beſide him ſate MARTIN and STORY, but a little lower, and CRANMER habited like a Doctour of Divinite, not like a Biſhop, was brought before them. Being told that there were thoſe who repreſented not only her Maieſties perſon, but alſo of the moſt holy Father the Pope, hee with due reverence ſaluted STORY and MARTIN, but would not ſo much as vouchſafe to caſt his eyes toward BROOKE, and that not (as he afterward confeſſed) of contempt of the man, whom hee formerly loved, but that hee might not ſeeme to acknowledge the Popes authoritie, hee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by oath to King HENRY obliged himſelfe to the contrary, eſpecially in <hi>England,</hi> where hee could make no pretence of right. Then each of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted him to change his opinion, and returne to the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:7277:168"/>
vnity of the Church: but hee not reguarding their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, they cite him to appeare within foureſcore dayes before his Holineſſe, which with her Maieſties conſent, he promiſed he would. But the Pope not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting his comming, within twenty dayes after by letters to the King and Queene commanded him to be condemned, and committed to the Secular power. After the intercourſe of a few dayes, new authoritie is by the Pope granted to BONER Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and THIRLBY Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> for CRANMERS de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation from Orders both Presbyteriall and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiepiſcopall and he then to be delivered over to the ſecular Magiſtrate to ſuffer for hereſie, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly performed on the fourteenth of <hi>February.</hi> Thoſe ſaintlike men, CRANMER, RIDLEY, and LATIMER, as long as they lived did by letters exhort each other to a generous conſtancie for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the truth of the Chriſtian faith. But the other two Champions having made their way to heaven, and left him alone not plied with ſuch firme exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, out of deſire of longer life his conſtancy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at length to be ſhaken, and that by the ſubtilty and daily perſuaſions of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Frier. So being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced with hope of pardon, he retracts what ever he had before written in defence of his Religion, which retractation was after printed &amp; publiſhed. But that little availed him. For whether that POOLE would not be longer excluded from the poſſeſſion of the Archbiſhopricke, or that (which ſeemes more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) the Queenes inveterate hate and deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge for her Mothers Divorce, which could not bee otherwiſe ſatiated then with the bloud of this grave man, were the cauſe: he being now confident of life is preſently rapt to the place of execution, and there cruelly burned, where RIDLEY and LATIMER had five moneths before beene crowned with Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome.
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:7277:169"/>
 On the day appointed for his execution, a Sermon by the appointment of the Cardinall was preached by Doctor COLE. Thither was CRAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MER brought, and placed conveniently neere the Pulpit, where COLE exhorted him to a conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in that faith, which hee was now content to acknowledge, and that even vnto death, which was now by the appointment of the Magiſtrate to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on him this very day. Gods wrath for the death of FISHER and MORE could not otherwiſe be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed but by his bloud. But before his death, would he by a publique confeſſion teſtifie his ſincere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to the vnitie of the Church, hee ſhould do an act moſt acceptable to God and men. If with this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected newes CRANMER were amazed, I do not at all wonder. But he recollecting himſelfe ſtood vp, and without any ſigne of feare, made a quicke Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the aſſembly, wherein having premiſed many things concerning morality and amendment of life, he repeates the principall points of his doctrine, brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explaines his Faith, affirmeth, <hi>that vnder the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie Papall the Kingdome of Antichriſt was contained and establiſhed, and laſtly demonſtrates how much hee had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded God by the abnegation of the Truth: Hee profeſſeth therefore, that he had reſolved, that his right hand, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he had ſo horribly ſinned by ſubſcribing to the doctrine propoſed by the enemies of Truth, ſhould firſt feele the ſmart of puniſhment;</hi> when hee would have proceeded to ſpeake more, the multitude of <hi>Romaniſts</hi> whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation he had ſo finely deluded, with clamors and ſcofs interrupted him, &amp; hurried him away preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the place of execution. There was then to be ſeene a ſad ſpectacle, and ſuch as would, I will not ſay, have extorted pittie from his very enemies, but have expreſſed teares from a flint: the chiefe Prelate of the Realme lately flouriſhing by reaſon of his power
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:7277:169"/>
and favour of Princes, a man of moſt holy converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for his age, aſpect, feature, learning, gravitie and rare guifts of minde deſervedly moſt Reverend, clad out of intent to expoſe him to mockery in an obſolete garment (for ſo had the Papiſts purpoſely arraied him) and bitterly taunted at to be dragged to death, and that death by the horrid tortures of fire. Being now faſtned to the ſtake, as ſoone as ever the flame began to aſcend, lifting vp his left hand to heaven, he thruſt forth his right hand into the flame, and there with admirable conſtancie continued it vntill it were conſumed, only once drawing it in, and with it ſtroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his beard. At length the raging flame ſpreding it ſelfe, lifting vp his eyes toward heaven, hee cried out, <hi>Lord receive my ſpirit,</hi> and his bodie abiding as immovable as the ſtake whereto hee was faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, hee patiently indured the fines violence, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till hee at laſt expired. His bodie being conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to aſhes, his heart was found intire and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch't. Had any of the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> found the like in any one of their faction, it ſhould have beene recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for a miracle, and that miracle ſufficed to have Sainted him.

and we little ſuſpecting an enterpriſe vpon the Caſtle, they ſudainly with fifteene peeces make a battery vpon the Caſtle, and continue it with ſuch fury, that the thunder of the Canon was all that day heard at <hi>Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werp,</hi> which is diſtant from thence more then one hundred <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles. Having by that time night drew on made a ſufficient breach, and yet in reguard of the deepe dikes filled with water (wherin conſiſted the maine hopes of the defendants) not able to come to an aſſault, the Enemy with great toile and labour by a cut from thence to the ſea draw the dikes ſo low, that by that time the tide was gone out, they march not above navell high through the dikes to the wall (which wee little feared could be done) without reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: finding the place void of defendants they ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily make themſelves maſters of the Caſtle, and had as eaſily taken the Towne, if Sir ANTHONY AGER Marſhall of the Towne had not with ſome few others made head againſt them, and forced them to retreat to the Caſtle, in which conflict that valiant Knight was ſlaine.

                     <p>PHILIP about the ſame time lodging neere <hi>Amiens</hi> with a great Army, HENRY with a far greater attended each motion of his.

But divers conſiderations had tempered their heat. PHILIP being the weaker of the two, ſaw no reaſon why to ingage himſelfe. HENRY had an Army which had twice felt the other victorious, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore loath on them to adventure his already ſhaken eſtate. Wherefore they ſo intrenched themſelves, and fortified their Campes with Artillery, as if they expected a ſiege from each other. Some moneths thus paſſed without any other exploits then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes and light skirmiſhes. At length they mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertaine a motion of peace, both of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that their Armies conſiſting of ſtrangers, the fruits of the victory would be to the Aliens on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but the calamity and burthen of the defeat would light on the ſhoulders of the vanquiſhed, or

Much altercation was had about the reſtoring of <hi>Calais,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> were reſolved to hold, and PHILIP would have no peace vnleſſe it were reſtored to MARY, whom in point of honour he could not ſo forſake.

 of ſo much innocent bloud, that of the Prophet was neceſſarily to be fulfilled in her, <hi>Bloud-thirſty men &amp;c. ſhall not finiſh halfe their dayes.</hi> For ſhe was cut off in the two and fortieth yeare of her age, hauing raigned onely fiue yeares foure moneths and eleuen dayes; wheras her Siſter, who ſucceeded her, moſt happily in a more milde gouernement ruled nine timesas long, and almoſt doubled her age. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the cauſe of Queen MARIE'S death there are divers conjectures. To relate what I finde in approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Authors, it is reported, that in the beginning of her ſickeneſſe her friends ſuppoſing that ſhe grieved at the abſence of her husband, whome ſhe ſaw ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in wars abroad, that ſhe could not hope for his ſpeedy returne, vſed conſolatory meanes, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to remove from her that fixed ſadneſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhe ſeemed to be oppreſled. But ſhe vtterly averſe from all comfort, and giving her ſelfe over to melancholy, told them, <hi>That ſhe died, but that of the true cauſe of her death they were ignorant, which if they were deſirous to know, they ſhould after her death diſſect her heart, and there they ſhould finde</hi> Calais: Intimating thereby, that the loſſe of <hi>Calais</hi> had occaſioned this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall griefe, which was thought to have beene increaſed by the death of the Emperor her Father-in-law. But the truth is, her liver being over-cooled by a <hi>Mole,</hi> theſe things peradventure might haſten her end, which could not otherwiſe be far from her, and caſt her by degrees into that kinde of Dropſy, which Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians terme <hi>Aſcites.</hi> This Dropſy being not diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in time, deceived her Phyſitians, who beleeved that ſhe had conceived by King PHILIP, whereas ſhe alas did breed nothing but her owne death. So mature remedies being not applied, and ſhe not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving a fit diet, ſhe fell into a Fever, which increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by little and little, at laſt ended in her death.

In the meane time, to give ſome ſatisfaction to the Reader, I will make this ſhort addition.</p>
                     <p>Some few houres after the deceaſe of Queene MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY, the Eſtates then aſſembled in Parliament, on the ſeventeenth of <hi>November</hi> declared her Siſter the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ELIZABETH Queene, who was Daughter to HENRY the Eighth and ANNE BOLEN. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving moſt gloriouſly reigned forty foure yeares foure moneths and ſeven dayes, ſhe ended her life and Reigne on the foure and twentieth of <hi>March Anno</hi> 1603, the Crown being by her death devolved to the renouned King of <hi>Scots</hi> IAMES the Sixt, to whome it was ſo far from feeling it a burthen to have ſucceeded ſo good a Princeſſe, that never was any Prince recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with greater applauſe and gratulation of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Many thinke their condition happy, if they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change a CALIGVLA for a CLAVDIVS, or a NERO for a VITELLIVS or an OTHO. But that any Mortall ſhould pleaſe after ELIZABETH, may ſeeme a miracle: and is a great argument both of rare vertue in the ſucceeding King, and of a right iudgement in the ſubject. For this great Lady was ſo farre beyond example, that even the beſt Princes
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:7277:179"/>
come ſhort of her; and they who moſt inveigh againſt that Sexe, contend, that Woman is incapable of thoſe vertues (in her moſt eminent) Wiſdome, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, Learning, variety of Languages, and Magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity equall to that of Men, to which I adde fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent Zeale of Piety and true Religion. But in theſe things peraduenture ſome one or other may equall her. What I ſhall beyond all this ſpeake of her (and let me ſpeake it without offence to my moſt excellent Soueraigne IAMES, the Paterne of Princes, the Mirrour of our Age, the Delight of <hi>Britaine)</hi> no age hath hitherto paraleld, nor (if my Augury faile not) none ever ſhall: That a Woman (and if that be not enough) a Virgin, deſtitute of the helpe of Parents, Brothers, Husband, being ſurrounded with enemies, the <hi>Pope</hi> thundring, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> threatening, the <hi>French</hi> ſcarce diſſembling his ſecret hate, as many of the neighboring Princes as were devoted to <hi>Rome,</hi> claſhing about her, ſhould containe this warlike Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not only in obedience, but in peace alſo, and (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all this) Popery being profligated, in the true Divine worſhip. Hence it comes to paſſe, that <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (which is among the reſt of it ſelfe a Miracle) hath not theſe many yeares heard the noiſe of war; and that our Church (which ſhe found much diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted) tranſcends all others of the Chriſtian world. For you ſhall at this day ſcarce finde any Church, which either defiled with Popiſh ſuperſtitions, or deſpoiled of thoſe Revenues which ſhould main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Profeſſors of the Truth, hath not laid open a way to all kinde of Errors, groſſe Ignorance in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning (eſpecially Divine) and at length to Ethnique Barbarouſneſſe. But to what end do I inſiſt on theſe or the like, they beeing ſufficiently knowne even to the <hi>Barbarians</hi> themſelves, and Fame having trumpetted them throughout the world. Which
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:7277:180"/>
 things when and how they were done, how bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſhe aided and relieved her Allies, how bravely ſhe reſiſted, brake, vanquiſhed her Enemies, I have a deſire in a continued Hiſtory to declare, and will (God willing) declare, if I can attaine to the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of the paſſages of thoſe times, have leaſure for the compiling it, and that no other more able then my ſelfe (which I wiſh may happen) in the meane time ingage themſelves therein.</p>
