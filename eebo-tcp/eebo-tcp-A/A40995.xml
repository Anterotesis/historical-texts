            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

 and from him to that whole Nation that ſprang of him; ſometimes the name doth relate to the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſometimes to the civill ſtate of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Sometimes to both; and ſo here in this place, this Text is for ſubſtance, the ſame with that prayer of <hi>David; Pſalme</hi> 51. 18. <note place="margin">Pſalm 51. 18.</note> 
               <hi>Doe good in thy good pleaſure unto Sion, build thou the wals of Jeruſalem,</hi> make up Lord, thoſe ſad brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that are made both in Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; So here in the Text, Lord finde a way to eaſe thy people of their many preſſures, to quiet the many and publique troubles, that are amongſt us, <hi>Deliver Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, O God, out of all his troubles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prophet <hi>David</hi> having throughout the whole Pſalme put up many great petitions for himſelfe, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97339:4"/>
his owne particular, and perſonall concernements, now he endeth and cloſeth the Pſalme with this zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous petition for the common cauſe, as if he had ſaid, Lord, how ever it fares with mee, doe well to thy Church and people; how ever my cauſe ſpeeds, let the common cauſe proſper; though I ſhould have all gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that I have asked for my ſelfe, yet that would not ſatisfie me without it may be well with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique troubles trouble me moſt: therefore deliver not onely <hi>David,</hi> but alſo <hi>Iſrael O God, out of all his troubles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this diſpoſition and affection which appeares here in this holy man to the common good, is the ſame which is, and ought to be, in all true <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in all the people of God; and that ſhall be my firſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation from theſe words, which I propound thus:</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>1</label> 
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> It is the duty of every one to ſtand well affected to the common good of the Church and ſtate wherein he lives.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſay, it is the dutie of every one, be he high or low, rich or poore, of what ranke and condition ſoever, Magiſtrate, Miniſter, private perſon, every one that hath any relation to <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, it is his duty to ſtand well affected to the common good, that is, firſt, in his mind highly to eſteem it above all his owne private concernements: ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in his will and affections to deſire it earneſtly, to rejoyce in it heartily, to mourne for the want of it deepely: thirdly, in his actions to endeavour it zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly, to ſtudie it, ſpeak for it, plead for it, to labor every way poſſible to promote it. This is to ſtand wel affected.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To the Common good both of Church and State; <hi>Iſrael</hi> in my Text includes both, they are both one and the ſame <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo neere allied, that the ſame men are the ſubject of both, though under a diverſe notion: the Church and Civill ſtate of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally imbrace one another like twins, the State defends and upholds the Church and Religion, and the Church bleſſeth and upholds the State, (as the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97339:5"/>
Widow maintained the Prophet, and the Prophet the Widow) if it goe ill with the one, the other cannot thrive; experience ſhowes, that the ruine of Civill States proves the ruine of Churches, and decay of Religion, and the ruine of Churches, and decay of Religion, proves the ruine of Civill ſtates. <note place="margin">Revel. 2.</note> 
When Chriſt had removed the Candleſtickes from <hi>Epbeſus,</hi> from <hi>Smyrna,</hi> from <hi>Laodicea,</hi> &amp;c. thoſe famous Cities were quickely laid in tho duſt: Therefore, the Doctrine ſaith, <hi>That it is the duty of every one to ſtand well affected to the common good, both of the Church and State wherein be lives.</hi> Religion admits not of that diſtinction, betweene a good man, and a good Citizen: it is impoſſible that he ſhould be a good Common-wealthsman, who is not a true friend unto the Church, nor can he be a good Church man, who is not a true friend to the Common-wealth: as there is no truſting of that man to be true in his Religion, who is not true in his Loyaltie; ſo there is no truſting of that man to be true in his Loyaltie, who is not true in his Religion.</p>

               <note place="margin">Confirmation</note> 
 Theſe things being thus explicated, I come now to the proofe of the point, and here firſt it were eaſie to bring forth variety of examples of godly perſons of all conditions, whoſe pulſes have continually beate to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the common good, ſometimes endeavouring it, ſometimes rejoycing in it, ſometimes bewailing the want of it, ſometimes praying for it, ſometimes prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it before their owne private concernments, yea, before their owne lives; I will inſtance in two or three examples inſtead of all.</p>

            <p>Firſt, Thoſe baſe and unworthy ſpirits, who, as if they were borne onely for themſelves, live onely to themſelves; make onely themſelves the center of all their aimes, and actions, have no publique thoughts, publique endeavours, ſeeke not at all the publique wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, but the feathering of their owne private neſts, is their utmoſt end: ſome there are who minde not the publique cauſe at all, they care not what dammage come to the weale publique, ſo they may ſucke to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thereby ſome private advantage; nay ſome care not though whole Kingdomes be ſet on fire, ſo they may warme themſelves by the flames thereof.</p>
            <p>Secondly, thoſe alſo are to be reproved, who though they be not actors in the common hurt, yet are abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, or at leaſt, not oppoſers: How many men in place and authority, have thereby opportunity to ſtop much evill, and to doe much good for the common cauſe, if they had hearts, but they have no courage for the truth as the Prophet ſpeakes: men can appeare for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and appeare for their friends, but not for God, or for the publique cauſe; O that men would beleeve that neutrality in this caſe, is all one with oppoſition, <note place="margin">Judg. 5. 23.</note> 
               <hi>Curſe ye Meroz, curſe the Inhabitants thereof, becauſe they</hi>

               <hi>come not forth to helpe,</hi> ſilence is not alwayes conſent, but when we ought to ſpeake it is; when God ſets a man in place, and gives ability, and offers him opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to ſhow himſelfe in a good cauſe, then and there for a man to doe nothing, is to doe evill, and to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe guilty of all the hurt that poſſibly might have been prevented, if hee had done what was in his power to doe. This may be applyed to every one whom God hath called to any publique imployment, and given opportunity unto, to doe any publique ſervice; if ye doe not for the Church, for the Common-wealth, what ye may doe, ye betray it, and what ever hurt the troublers of <hi>Iſrael</hi> doe, whom ye have not to your pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er oppoſed, will be ſet upon your ſcore.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This reproofe may yet be brought downe lower, even to men of private condition, wee heard that even ſuch ought to have publique ſpirits, and not minde onely their owne things, but the publique cauſe.</p>

what meaneſt thou, O ſleeper? ariſe, call upon thy God that we periſh not.

How few, how cold, how formall are our Prayers, for a happy ſucceſſe of thoſe great affaires that are in hand? How little doe we in theſe ſtirring times, towards the carrying on of the great worke of Beformation?

what they order; pulling backward all they can, not affording them a good word for all their paines and care, and coſt, and hazarding daily their very lives for the publique ſafetie, yet how little all this is regarded by many, and how ill requited, I cannot ſpeake with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out griefe and ſhame; the <hi>Lord lay not this ſin to our charge.</hi> Thoſe people are farre from promoting the publique good, who doe what they can to diſ-hearten, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage thoſe who are promoting it.

               <hi>David</hi> keeps this method, not only in this Pſalme, but in the 51.

            <p>Secondly, Take this further direction, who ever would pray aright for <hi>Iſraels</hi> deliverance from trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, muſt get a <hi>Heart affected with, and bleeding for Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raels troubles;</hi> none are fit to pray for the publique cauſe but they who have publique ſpirits, and can make the publique weale or woe their owne; wee many times want words in this caſe, becauſe wee want affections, commonly deepe inward impreſſions doe cauſe large outward expreſſions; this hath made the Saints of God begge as earneſtly for the common cauſe, as they could have done for their owne lives.</p>

               <hi>Prophets of Jeruſalem, profaneneſſe</hi> may no longer goe forth, <hi>over all the Land;</hi> that they who ſhould be ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying to ſave Soules, may not buſie themſelves about troubling States and Kingdomes; Pray that God would ſend forth faithfull Labourers into his Harveſt, and provide a burning and ſhining Light for every Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticke of this Land: if the Goſpell of Peace were well Preached throughout the Kingdome, it would be a ſingular meanes to ſettle, and maintaine the Peace of the Goſpell.</p>

               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:97339:15"/>
Thirdly, I muſt yet further put you in minde of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther troublers of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>his adherents,</hi> all <hi>Jeſuited papiſts,</hi> and their abetters, are arch Church-troublers, and State-troublers, and ever were; And ſo long as theſe <hi>Canaanites</hi> live among us, and hold up their heads, let us never looke for peace; <hi>Is it peace Jehu?</hi> ſaith <hi>Joram:</hi> the anſwer is, <hi>What peace?</hi> So long as Idolatrie is countenanced in <hi>Iſrael;</hi> Have we not found by experience, this <hi>Antichristian</hi> and <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſect,</hi> to be alwayes enemies unto Peace, and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters of diviſion, betweene King and people, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and Kingdome? What a ſad thing is it to thinke that this generation of Vipers, which have ſo often ſtung us, ſhould yet be nouriſhed in our boſomes? ſhall they lodge there till they eate out our hearts? <hi>(Sic notus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes?)</hi> Will we beleeve nothing, untill their knives be at our throates, and their ſwords in our bowels? pardon my zeale in this behalfe, it is the cauſe of God, <note place="margin">Cal. 5. 12.</note> 
and the common cauſe; <hi>I would they were cut off that trouble you,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> and yet he was no uncharitable man; Mercy to them, is cruelty to the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, it hath proved ſo hitherto: Yee know what a fire this generation of men have now kindled in <hi>Ireland,</hi> they are blowing the coales here, and God knowes how ſoone the flame may breake out.</p>
            <p>I heare ſometimes in this City, ſome men cry out ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently againſt <hi>Puritans, puritans,</hi> what monſters they are, and ſome amongſt us ſay, they had rather ſide with <hi>Papiſts</hi> than <hi>Puritans;</hi> I beſeech you let mee ſpeake freely, I am not yet learned enough to interpret the meaning of that word <hi>Puritan,</hi> I know that with that ſtaffe, the prophane world beates all that are better than themſelves. I would be loth to countenance the intemperancies and wilde courſes of a froward Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration amongſt us, who ſhame the Religion they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto, of whom, more preſently; but yet I would deſire that reaſonable men would conſider, whether
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:97339:15"/>
partie they had rather truſt their throates with, (if it ſhould come to that) the Papiſts, or the Puritans; and whether partie hath been greater plotters againſt States and Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, I doe not yet deny but that there are troublers of <hi>Iſrael</hi> on that other hand alſo; ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe a ſtrict way of Religion, yet walke not according to the Rules of Religion; ſome deſpiſe Authority, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne Lawes, diſturbe common Order, runne out of ranke; Some in theſe daies uſurpe upon the <hi>Office of the Miniſtery uncalled,</hi> to the great offence of Authoritie, and hinderance of the Reformation in hand; Some u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpe upon the <hi>Office of the Magiſtrate,</hi> who being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men, take upon them to be publique Reformers, not knowing of <hi>what ſpirit they are,</hi> nor conſidering in what Station God hath ſet them. Doubtleſſe, many things are amiſſe in Church and Common-weale, and it becomes every one to the utmoſt of his power, to promote the deſired Reformation, but in a right way, and due Order; every one muſt conſider, not only what is fit to be done, but what is fit for him, or one in his place to doe, leſt inſtead of making up of the breach, <note place="margin">2. Sam. 6. 6. </note> 
we prove makers of breaches, as it fell out in the caſe of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzab.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, I muſt alſo bring into this Catalogue of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and thoſe other turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Sectaries amongſt us, who trouble our people, by buzzing in their eares, that we have no true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, no true Church, no true Ordinances, but all Antichriſtian, and upon theſe grounds ſeparate from our Congregations, and ſet up new Churches among themſelves: experience proves that there is an unquiet ſpirit in many of theſe, ignorant, proud, cenſorious, headſtrong, ſelfe-conceited, ſelfe-exalting, contrarie to the wiſedome that is from above, which is <note place="margin">Iam. 1. 17.</note> 
               <hi>Firſt pure, then peaceable,</hi> humble, meeke, gentle, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>

               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 14. 33.</note> 
 O Pray to God, who is the God of <hi>Order,</hi> and not of <hi>confuſion,</hi> to ſet up order amongſt us betimes, leſt whilſt every man Preacheth what he will, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth what he will, we breake into ſo many peeces, as will but prepare us to become all a prey to the common adverſary.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, I had here concluded, but that me thinkes I heare ſome man bleſſe himſelfe, and ſay, I am none of theſe troublers of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that have yet beene na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. I beſeech you therefore, give me leave to be plaine with you, in naming one kinde of Church, and State troublers more, and then I have done. Every wicked liver, every unreformed perſon, every ungodly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, prophane, uncleane perſon, is a troubler of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:</hi> See the proofe, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4. 1. <hi>The Lord hath a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie with the Land, becauſe of ſwearing, lying, ſtealing,</hi> oppreſſing, committing adulterie; becauſe of theſe the <hi>Land mournes.</hi> Oh, conſider it, are there none ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you? Thou ſayeſt thou art no <hi>Papiſt,</hi> but art thou not an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> one that lives as if there were no God in the world? Thou ſayeſt, thou art no <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke,</hi> but art thou not a <hi>Scoffer at Religion,</hi> and a jearer at thoſe who walke in that way which is called holy? Thou thankeſt God thou art no troubleſome <hi>Sectary,</hi> but art thou not a <hi>prophane perſon like Eſau;</hi> a ſwearer, a drunkard, a fornicatour, a deceiver, one that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt the Goſpell, and art a ſhame to the Goſpell? if thou beeſt, thou art a grand troubler of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and thou haſt a hand in pulling downe judgements upon the Land. Beloved, let every one of us looke to it, leſt while we endeavour to helpe <hi>Iſrael</hi> by our prayers, and contributions, we hurt and wound <hi>Iſrael</hi> by our lives: There is great variety of thoughts amongſt men, about reformation of government, and reformation of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; The Lord ſend forth his truth and Light, and ſhew us all our wandrings, and lead us in the good
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:97339:16"/>
way, in that behalfe; but all ſorts agree in this thing, about the neceſſity of Reformation in manners; O let us every one mend one, every one ſweepe before his owne doore, every one reforme his owne houſe, his owne heart, and then, as ye heard in the ſecond point, we ſhall be fit to intercede for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and pray with <hi>David</hi> here, <hi>Deliver Iſrael, O God, out of all his troubles.</hi>
