            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Eader: I will complement, and put a caſe to you. I met with a man, and upon our Diſcourſe he fell out with me: this man having a good wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, having neither wit, ſtomack, nor skill; I ſay this man may come home by <hi>Totnam-high-Croſs,</hi> and cauſe the Clerk to tole his knell: It is the very like caſe with the Gentleman Angler that goeth to the River for his pleaſure: this Ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler hath neither judgement, knowledge, nor experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; he may come home light laden at his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>A man that goeth to the River for his pleaſure, muſt underſtand, when he commeth there, to ſet forth his Tackles. The firſt thing he muſt do, is to obſerve the Sun, the Wind, the Moon, the Starres, and the Wanes of the Air; to ſet forth his Tackles according to the times and ſeaſons; to goe for his pleaſure, and ſome profit.</p>
            <p>As for example, the Sun proves cloudy; then muſt he ſet forth either his ground Bait or Tackles, and of the brighteſt of his Flies. If the Sun prove bright, then muſt he put on ſome of the darkeſt of his flies. Thus muſt you goe to work with your Flies, light for darkneſs, and dark for lightneſs, with the wind in the South, then that blows the Flie in the Trouts mouth. Though I ſet down the wind being in the South, if the weather be warm, I am indifferent where the wind ſtandeth, either with ground Bait
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54574:3"/>
or Menow, ſo that I can caſt my Bait into the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. The very ſame obſervations is for night, as for day: For if the Moon prove cleer, or if the Stars glitter in the skie, there is as ill Angling that night, as if it were at high noon in the midſt of Summer, when the Sun ſhineth at the brighteſt, wherein there is no hopes of pleaſure.</p>
            <p>I will begin to Angle for the Trout, with the ground Baits with this quality.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing you muſt gaine, muſt be a neat taper Rod, light before, with a tender hazell top, which is very gentle. If you deſire to attain my way of Angling, (for I have Angled theſe forty years) with a ſingle haire of five lengths, one tied to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the bottom of my Line, and a Line of three haired links for the uppermoſt part; &amp; ſo you may kill the greateſt Trout that ſwims, with Sea-room.</p>
            <p>He that Angles with a Line, made of three haired links at the bottom, and more at the top, may kill Fiſh: but he that Angles with one hair ſhall kill five Trouts to the others one; for the Trout is very quick ſighted; therefore the beſt way for night or day, is to keep out of the ſight. You muſt Angle al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes with the point of your Rod downe the ſtream; for a Fiſh hath not the quickneſs of ſight ſo perfect up the ſtream, as oppoſite againſt him, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving ſeaſonable times; as for example, we begin to Angle in <hi>March</hi>; If it prove cloudie, you may Angle with the ground Baits all day long: but if it prove bright and cleere, you muſt take the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and evening, or elſe you are not like to do any good; ſo the times muſt be obſerved, and truely underſtood; for when an Angler commeth to the River for his pleaſure that doth not underſtand to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54574:3"/>
ſet forth his Tackles fit for the time, it is as good keep them in the bag, as ſet them forth.</p>
            <p>I am determined to Angle with the ground Baits and ſet my Tackles to my Rod, and go to my pleaſure: I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at the uppermoſt part of the ſtreame, carrying my Line with an upright hand, feeling the Plummet run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on the ground ſome ten inches from the hook, plumming my Line according to the ſwiftneſſe of the ſtream you Angle in; for one plummet will not ſerve for all ſtreams; for the true Angling is that the plum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met runneth on the ground.</p>
            <p>For the Bait. The red knotted worme is very good where Brandlins are not to be had, but Brandlins are better: now that you may bring theſe Brandlings ſit to Angle with, that they may live long on the hook, which cauſeth the beſt ſport. When you have gathered your worms out of the dung-hill, you muſt gaine the greeneſt Moſs you can find, then waſh the earth very clean out of it, then provide an earthen pot, ſo put your Moſs into the pot, then put the worms to the Moſs into the pot; within two days you ſhall find your worms ſo poor, that if you bait ſome of them on your hook, you ſhall ſee that with throwing of them two or three times into the water, they will dye and grow white: now the skill is, when theſe worms be grown poor, you muſt feed them up to make them fat and luſty, that they may live long on the hook; that is the chiefeſt point.</p>
            <p>To make them luſty and fat, you muſt take the yolke of an Egge, ſome eight or ten ſpoonfull of the top of new milk, beaten well together in a Porringer, warm it a little, untill you ſee it curdle; then take it off the fire, and ſet it to coole; when it is cold, take a ſpoonfull and drop it upon your Moſs into the pot, every drop about the bigneſſe of a green Pea, ſhifting your Moſs twice in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54574:4"/>
the week in the Summer, and once in the winter: thus doing, you ſhall feed your wormes fat, and make them luſty, that they will live a long time on the hook; ſo you may keep them all the year long. This is my true experience for the ground Baits, for the running Line for the Trout.</p>
            <p>The Angling with a Menow, called in ſome places Pencks for a Trout, is a pleaſant ſport, and killeth the greateſt Fiſh; he commeth boldly to the Bait, as if it were a Maſtive Dog at a Beare: you may Angle with greater Tackles, and ſtronger, &amp; be no prejudice to you in your Angling: a Line made of three ſilks and three hairs twiſted for the uppermoſt part of the Line, and two ſilkes and two haires twiſted for the bottome next your hook, with a Swivel nigh the middle of your Line, with an indifferent large hook.</p>
            <p>To bait your hook with a Menow, you muſt put your hook through the lowermoſt part of his mouth, ſo draw your hook thorow, then put the hook in at the mouth againe, let the point of the hook come out at the hindmoſt Fin, then draw your Line, and the Menowes mouth will cloſe, that no water will get into its belly; you muſt alwayes be Angling with the point of your Rod down the ſtream, with drawing the Menow up the ſtream by little and little, nigh the top of the water; the Trout ſeeing the bait, commeth at it moſt fiercely, ſo give a little time before you ſtrike: This is the true way, without Lead; for many times I have had them come at the Lead and forſake the Menow, ſo he that tryeth ſhall prove it in time: let us go to Angling with a Flie, which is a delightfull ſport.</p>
            <p>The Rod muſt be light and tender, if you can fit your ſelfe with an Hazell, either of one piece or two ſet together in the moſt convenient manner, light and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54574:4"/>
gentle: ſet your Line to the Rod; for the uppermoſt part, you may uſe your owne diſcretion; for the lower part, next your Flie, muſt be of three or foure haired links. If you can attain to Angle with one haire, you ſhall have the more riſes, and kill more fiſh; be ſure you doe not over-load your ſelf with the length of your Line: before you begin to Angle, make a triall, having the winde in your back, to ſee at what length you can caſt your Flie, that the Flie light firſt into the water, and no longer; for if any of the Line falleth into the water before the Flie, it is better unthrowne then throwne: be ſure you be caſting alwayes downe the ſtream, with the Wind behinde you, and the Sun before; it is a ſpeciall point to have the Sunne and Moon before you; for the very motion of the Rod drives all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from you, either by day or night in all your Ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, both for Wormes and Flies; ſo there muſt bee a great care of that.</p>
            <p>Let us begin to Angle in <hi>March</hi> with the Flie: If the weather prove Windie, or Cloudie, there are ſeverall kindes of Palmers that are good for that time.</p>
            <p>Firſt, a black Palmer ribbed with ſilver: the ſecond, a black Palmer with an Orange-tauny body: thirdly, a black Palmer, with the body made all of black: fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a red Palmer ribbed with gold, and a red hackle mixed with Orenge cruel; theſe Flies ſerve all the year long morning and evening, windie and cloudie. Then if the Aire prove bright and cleare, you muſt imitate the Hauthorn Flie, which is all black and very ſmall, and the ſmaller the better. In <hi>May</hi> take the <hi>May</hi>-flie: imitate that, which is made ſeverall wayes; ſome make them with a ſhammy body, ribbed with a black haire: another way made with Sandy-Hogges wooll, rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with black ſilke, and winged with a Mallards
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54574:5"/>
feather, according to the fancy of the Angler. There is another called the Oak-Flie, which is made of Orange colour Cruell and black, with a browne wing; imitate that: Another Flie, the body made with the ſtrain of a Pea-Cocks feather, which is very good in a bright day: The Graſſe-hopper which is green, imitate that; the ſmaller the Flies be made, and of indifferent ſmall hooks, they are the better; theſe ſorts I have ſet downe, will ſerve all the year long, obſerving the times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: Note, the lighteſt of your Flies for cloudy and darkneſſe, and the darkeſt of your Flies for lightneſſe, and the reſt for indifferent times; that a mans owne Judgement, with ſome experience and diſcretion muſt guide him: If he mean to kill Fiſh, he muſt alter his Flies according to theſe directions. Now, of late, I have found, that Hogs-wooll, of ſeverall colours, makes good grounds; and the wooll of a red Heyfer makes a good body: And Bears wool makes a good ground; ſo I now work much of them, and it procureth very much ſport.</p>
            <p>The naturall Flie is ſure Angling, and will kill great ſtore of Trouts with much pleaſure: As for the May-Flie, you ſhall have them alwayes playing at the River ſide, eſpecially againſt Raine. The Oake-Flie is to bee had on the butt of an Oake, or an Aſh, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>May</hi> to the end of <hi>Auguſt:</hi> it is a browniſh Flie, and ſtands alwayes with his head towards the root of the tree, very eaſie to be found: The ſmall black Flie is to be had on every Hawthorn Buſh, after the buds be come forth: Your Graſſe-hopper, which is green, is to be had in any Medow of Graſſe in <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July</hi>: with theſe Flies, you muſt Angle with ſuch a Rod as you Angle with the ground Bait; the Line muſt not be ſo long as the Rod: with drawing your flie, as you finde
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54574:5"/>
convenient in your Angling. When you come to deep waters that ſtand ſomewhat ſtill, make your Line ſome two yards long, or thereabout, and dop your Flie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde a a Buſh, which Angling I have had good ſport at; we call it doping.</p>
            <p>A Lord lately ſent to me at Sun going down, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide him a good diſh of Trouts againſt the next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by ſix of the Clock: I went to the door to ſee how the wains of the Aire were like to prove, and returned anſwer, that I doubted not but to be provided (God willing) at my time appointed. I went preſently to the River, and it proved very dark; I drew out a Line of three ſilkes and three hairs twiſted for the uppermoſt part, and a Line of two ſilks and two hairs twiſted for the lowermoſt part, with a good large hook: I baited my hook with two Lob-worms, the four ends hanging as meet as I could gheſſe them in the dark: I fell to Angle; it proved very dark, that I had good ſport, Ang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with the Lob-worms, as I doe with the Flie, at the top of the water; you ſhall heare the Fiſh riſe at the top of the water, then you muſt looſe a ſlack Line down to the bottome, as nigh as you can gheſſe, then hold a ſtraight Line; feeling the Fiſh bite, give time, there is no doubt of loſing the Fiſh; for there is not one among twenty, but doth gorge the Bait: the leaſt ſtroak you can ſtrike to faſten the hook, makes the fiſh ſure, and then you may take the fiſh up with your hands: The night began to alter and grew ſomewhat lighter; I took off the Lob-worms, and ſet to my Rod a white Palmer Flie, made of a large hook, I had ſport for the time, till it grew lighter: then I put on my red Palmer, I had ſport for the time, untill it grew very light; then I ſet on my black Palmer, had good ſport, made up my diſh of fiſh, put up my Tackles, and was at my time appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the ſervice. For theſe three Flies, with the help
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54574:6"/>
of the Lob-worms, ſerve to Angle all the year long, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the times, as I have ſhewed in this nights work: a light Flie for darknes, the red Flie <hi>in medio,</hi> and a dark Flie for lightneſſe: This is my experiment for this kind of Angling, which is the ſureſt Angling of all, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the greateſt Fiſh: your Lines may be ſtrong, but muſt be no longer then the Rod.</p>
            <p>To take a Carp either in Pond or River, if you mean to have ſport with ſome profit, you muſt take a peck of Ale-graines, and a good quantity of any bloud, and mix the bloud and graines together, and caſt it in the places where you meane to Angle; this feed will gather the ſeale Fiſh together, as Carp, Tench, Roach, Dace, and Bream; the next morning be at your ſport very early, plum your ground: you may Angle for the Carp with a ſtrong Line; the Bait muſt be either a red knot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worm, or Paſte: there is no doubt of ſport.</p>
            <p>To take Pearch. The Pearch feeds well, if you light where they be, and bites very free: My opinion is, (with ſome experience) to bait with Lob-worms, chopt in pieces over night; ſo come in the morning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, plum your ground, gage your line, bait your hook with a red knotted worme; but I hold a Menow better: put the hook in at the back of the Menow, betwixt the fiſh and the skin, that the Menow may ſwim up and down alive, being boyed up with a Cork or Quill, that the Menow may have liberty to ſwimme a foot off the the ground: there is no doubt of ſport with profit.</p>
            <p>I will ſhew, a little, my opinion of floating for ſcale Fiſh in the River or Pond: The feed brings the Fiſh to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, as the ſheep to the Pen: There is nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in all your Anglings, for feed, then Bloud and Grains; I hold it better then Paſte: then plumming your ground, Angling with fine Tackles, as ſingle haire for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54574:6"/>
halfe the Line next the hook, round and ſmall plumed, according to your float: For the Bait, there is a ſmall red worm, with a yellow tip on his taile, is very good; Brandlins, Gentles, Paſte, or Cadice, which we call Cod-bait, they lye in a gravelly husk under ſtones in the River: theſe be the ſpeciall Baits for theſe kinde of Fiſh.</p>
            <p>One of my name was the beſt Trouler, for a Pike, in this Realme: he laid a wager, that he would take a Pike of four foot long, of Fiſh, within the ſpace of one Moneth, with his Trouling-Rod; ſo he Trouled three weeks and odde dayes, and took many great Pikes, nigh the length, but did not reach the full length, till within the ſpace of three dayes of the time; then he took one, and won the wager. The manner of his Trouling was, with a Hazell Rod of twelve foot long, with a Ring of Wyre in the the top of his Rod, for his Line to runne thorow: within two foot of the bottome of the Rod there was a hole made, for to put in a winde, to turne with a barrell, to gather up his Line, and looſe at his pleaſure; this was his manner of Trouling: But I will pawn my credit, that I will ſhew a way, either in Maior, Pond, or River, that ſhall take more Pikes than any Trouler with his Rod: And thus it is. Firſt, take forked ſtick, a Line of twelve yards long wound upon it, at the upper end, leave about a yard, either to tye a bunch of Sags, or a Bladder, to Boy up the Fiſh, and to carry it from the ground: the Bait muſt be a live Fiſh, either Dace, or Gudgin, or Roach, or a ſmall Trout: the forked ſtick muſt have a ſlit in the one ſide of the fork to put in the Line, that you may ſet your live Fiſh to ſwimme at a gage, that when the Pike taketh the Bait, he may have the full liberty of the Line for his feed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:54574:7"/>You may turne theſe looſe, either in Pond or River: in the Pond with the winde all day long, the more the better: at night ſet ſome ſmall weight, as may ſtay the Boy, as a Ship lyeth at Anchor, till the Fiſh taketh. For the River, you muſt turne all looſe with the ſtreame; two or three be ſufficient to ſhew pleaſure, gaged at ſuch a depth as they will go currant downe the River; there is no doubt of ſport, if there be Pikes: for the hooks, they muſt be doubled hooks, the ſhanks ſhould be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſhorter then ordinary: my reaſon is, the ſhorter the hook is of the ſhank, it will hurt the live Fiſh the leſſe, and muſt be armed with ſmall wyre well ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; but I hold a hook armed with twiſted ſilk to be better, for it will hurt the live Fiſh leaſt.</p>
            <p>If you arm your hook with wyre, the neeld muſt be made with a ſmall hook at the one end thereof. If you arme with ſilke, the neeld muſt be made with an eye: then muſt you take one of thoſe Baits alive (which you can get) and with one of your neelds enter within a ſtrawes breadth of the Gill of the Fiſh, ſo put the neeld betwixt the skin and the Fiſh; then pull the neeld out at the hindmoſt ſinne, and draw the arming thorow the Fiſh, untill the hook come to lye cloſe to the Fiſhes bodie: But I hold for thoſe that be armed with wyre to take off the hook, and put the neeld in the hindmoſt ſin and ſo to come forth at the Gill; then put on the hook drawn cloſe to the body, 'twill hurt the live Fſh the leſs, ſo knit the arming with the live Fiſh to the Line; then put off either in Maior or Pond, with the winde, in the River with the ſtream: The more you put off in Maior or Pond, you are like to have the more pleaſure: For the River I have ſhewed you before.</p>
            <p>There is a time when Pikes goe a Frogging Ditch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and in the River to Sun them, as in May, June and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54574:7"/>
July, there is a ſpeedy way to take them, and not to miſſe ſcarce one in twenty.</p>
            <p>You muſt take a Line of ſix or eight foot long, arm a large hook, of the largeſt ſize that is made; arm it to your Line, lead the ſhank of your hook very handſom, that it may be of ſuch a weight as you may guide the hook at your pleaſure: you may ſtrike the Pike, you ſee, with the bare hook where you pleaſe: this Line and hook doth far exceed ſnaring.</p>
            <p>The principall ſport to take a Pike, is to take a Gooſe or Gander, or Duck: take one of the Pike Lines I have ſhewed you before: tye the Line under the left wing, and over the right wing, about the body, as a man wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his Belt: turne the Gooſe off into a Pond, where <hi>Pikes</hi> are, there is no doubt of ſport, with great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, betwixt the Gooſe and the <hi>Pike</hi>: It is the greateſt ſport and pleaſure that a noble Gentleman in <hi>Shropſhire</hi> doth give his friends entertainment with.</p>
            <p>The way to make the beſt paſte is, Take a reaſonable quantity of freſh Butter, as much freſh ſheeps Suet, a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable quantity of the ſtrongeſt Cheeſe you can get, with the ſoft of an old ſtale white loafe; beat all this in a Morter till it come to perfect paſte; put as much on your hook as a green peaſe.</p>
            <p>There are many wayes to take Eeles: I will ſhew you a good way to take a diſh of Eeles. When you ſtay a night or two Angling, take four or five Lines, ſuch as be laid for <hi>Pikes,</hi> of fourteen or fifteen yards long, and at every two yards make a nooſe, to hang a hook armed either to double thred, or ſilk twiſt; for it is better then wyre: Bait your Hooks with Millors-thumbs, Loaches, Menowes, or Gudgins: tye to every nooſe a Line bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: theſe Lines muſt be laid croſſe the River in the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt places, either with ſtones, or pegged, ſo the Line lie
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54574:8"/>
in the bottome of the river, there is no doubt of taking a diſh of Eeles; you muſt have a ſmall neeld with an eye, to bait your hooks.</p>
            <p>Now to ſhew how to make Flies: learn to make two Flies, and make all: that is, the Palmer ribbed with ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or gold, and the May-flie: theſe are the ground of all Flies.</p>
            <p>We will begin to make the Palmer Flie: You muſt arme your Line on the inſide of the hook; take your Sciſers, and cut ſo much of the brown of the Mallards feather, as in your owne reaſon ſhall make the wings, then lay the outmoſt part of the feather next the hook, and the point of the feather towards the ſhanke of the hook, then whip it three or four times about the hook with the ſame ſilk you armed the hook: then make your ſilk faſt: then you muſt take the hackle of the neck of a Cock or Capon, or a Plovers top, which is the beſt, take off the one ſide of the feather, then you muſt take the hackle ſilk, or cruell, gold or ſilver thred; make all theſe faſt at the bent of the hook, then you muſt begin with Cruell, and Silver, or Gold, and work it up to the wings, every bout ſhifting your fingers, and making a ſtop, then the gold will fall right, then make faſt: then worke up the hackle to the ſame place, then make the hackle faſt: then you muſt take the hook betwixt your finger and thumb, in the left hand, with a neeld or pin, part the wings in two: then with the arming ſilk, as you have faſtned all hitherto, whip about as it falleth croſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the wings, then with your thumb you muſt turne the point of the feather towards the bent of the hook, then work three or four times about the ſhank, ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten, then view the proportion.</p>
            <p>For the other Flies: If you make the grounds of Hogs-wooll, ſandy, black, or white; or the wooll of a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54574:8"/>
Bear, or of a two year old red Bullock: you muſt work al theſe grounds upon a waxed ſilk, then you muſt arm and ſet on the wings, as I have ſhewed before: For the May-flie, you work the body with ſome of theſe grounds, which is very good, ribbed with a black hair; you may work the body with Cruels, imitating the Colour, or with Silver, with ſuiting the wings. For the Oak-flie, you muſt make him with Orange-tauny and black, for the body, and the brown of the Mallards feather for the wings. If you do after my directions, they will kill fiſh, obſerving the times fitting, and follow my former Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections.</p>
            <p>If any worthy or honeſt Angler cannot hit of theſe my Directions, let him come to me, he ſhall read and I will work, he ſhall ſee all things done according to my foreſaid Directions: So I conclude for the Flies having ſhewed you my true Experiments, with the Rod, I will ſet all labouring ſports aſide:</p>
            <p>And now I am waiting on my Lord with a great Diſh of Trouts, who meeting with company, commanded me to turne Scullion, and dreſſe a Dinner of the Trouts wee had taken: whereupon I gave my Lord this Bill of fare, which I did furniſh his Table with, according as it was furniſhed with fleſh. Trouts in broth, which is reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: Trouts broyled, cut and filled with ſweet Herbes chopt: Trouts calvored hot with Antchovaes ſauce: Trouts boyled; out of which Kettle I make three Diſhes; the one for a Souſed Diſh, another for a Stew'd Diſh, the third for a hot Diſh: the Sauce is Butter, Vinegar, beaten Cinamon, with the juyce of a Lemmon, beaten very well together, that the Sauce is white and thick, or elſe it is no Sauce for a great mans Table: Trouts fryed, which muſt be done, and not put into the Pan, untill the Suet boyle very high, and kept with ſtirring all the time
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54574:9"/>
they are frying, being flowr'd firſt. Trouts ſtew'd: Trouts cloſe, boyled with the calvored Trouts, all in one Ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and the ſame liquor: Trouts butter'd with Egs: Trouts roaſted: Trouts baked: theſe are for the firſt courſe, before the Salt.</p>
            <p>And theſe are for the latter courſe. Trouts calvored cold: Trouts flat cold: Baked Trouts: Trouts maril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that will eat perfect and ſweet three moneths in the heat of Summer: if I did ſay, for the whole year about, I would make it good.</p>
            <p>For the dreſſing of four or five of the Diſhes, I will ſhew you how I did perform them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I will ſhew you for the boyling and calvoring, that ſerves for hot and cold, for firſt and latter courſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, you muſt draw out the Intrails of the fiſh, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the fiſh two or three times in the back; lay them in a Tray or Platter, put ſome Vinegar upon them; you ſhall ſee the fiſh turn ſanguine, if they be new, preſently: you muſt put ſo much water in the Kettle as you thinke will cover them, with a pint of Vinegar, a handfull of Salt, ſome Roſemary and Thyme and ſweet Marjoram tyed in a bunch: then you muſt make this liquor boyle with a fierce fire made of wood: when the liquor hath boyled very well, put in your fiſh by one and one, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your liquor alwayes boyling, untill you have put all in: having provided a cover for your Kettle, ſo put on the cover: you muſt have a paire of Bellowes to blow up the fire with ſpeed, that the liquor may boyle up to the top of the Kettle; ſo the fierce boiling will make the Fiſh to calvor: provided, the fiſh be new killed: you may let them boile nigh a quarter of an hour; when they are cold, you may put them in a Tray or earthen Pan, untill you have occaſion to uſe them: be ſure they lie covered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:54574:9"/>For your ſtewed Trouts, you muſt cut them on the ſide, as for broiling: there are divers wayes of ſtewing; the Engliſh hath one way, the French hath another way, the Italian hath another way: I may ſpeak this; for I have been admitted into the Kitchins, to furniſh men of moſt Nations, when they have been in England.</p>
            <p>We will begin with the Engliſh: He broyleth firſt upon a Charcoale fire: the firſt thing that you muſt have a care of is, when your Grid-iron is hot you muſt coole it with ruff Suet, then the skin of your Fiſh will not break, with care of turning them: when they are nigh broyled, take them off the Grid-iron; ſet on a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing-dish of coals in a Stew-pan, or Dish; put in a good quantity of fresh Butter, ſo much Vinegar as will give the relish, a penny-worth of beaten Cinamon; then put in your broyled fish, and let them ſtew, about halfe an houre will be ſufficient, being turned: adorn your Dish with Sippets, take the fish out of the ſtew-pan, lay them for the ſervice, be ſure to ſqueaſe a Lemmon on them: I will warrant them good victuall.</p>
            <p>The Italian he ſtewes upon a Chaſing-dish of coals, with white-Wine, Cloves, and Mace, Nutmegs ſliced, a little Ginger: you muſt underſtand when this fish is ſtewed, the ſame liquor that the fish is ſtewed in, muſt be beaten with ſome Butter and the juyce of a Lemmon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is dish'd for the ſervice. The French doe add to this a ſlice or two of Bacon.</p>
            <p>I will ſhew you the way to marrionate a Trout or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fish, that will keep a quarter of a yeare in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, which is the Italians rareſt Dish for fresh fish, and will eat perfect and ſweet.</p>
            <p>You muſt take out the Intrailes as you doe of other fish, and cut them a-croſſe the ſides, as you do to broyle, washed clean, dried with a cloth, lay them upon a Tray
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:54574:10"/>
or board, ſprinkle a little ſalt on them, and flowre them as to frie them, ſo take your Frying-pan with ſo much Suet, when it is melted, as the Fiſh may lye to the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide in the liquor, and ſo fry them; and every time you turn them, flower them againe, untill you finde the fiſh fryed ſufficient: when you think the fiſh is fryed, take it out of the Pan, and lay it upon ſome thing, that the liquor may draine out of it; when the fiſh is cold, you may reare it an end.</p>
            <p>You muſt have a cloſe Veſſell to keep this fiſh and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor in, that no winde comes in, according to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity you make triall of.</p>
            <p>For the Liquor. Firſt, you muſt take halfe Claret-Wine, the other halfe Vinegar, two or three Bay-leaves, ſo much Saffron as a Nut tyed in a cloth, with ſome Cloves and large Mace, ſome Nutmeg ſliced; boile all theſe together very well; when the liquor is cold, and the fiſh cold, put the fiſh and liquor into the cloſe Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, with three or four Lemmons ſliced among the fish; make all cloſe that no winde can get into the Veſſell; after eight or ten days you may begin to eat of this fish; the Sauce muſt be ſome of the ſame liquor, with ſome of a ſliced Lemmon.</p>
            <p>
               <label>To dreſſe a Pike.</label>
When the <hi>Pike</hi> cometh into the Kitchin, kill it; then take a handfull of Salt, with water, and rub the fish ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well to take the ſlime off, draw out the Intrailes; wash the <hi>Pike</hi> cleane, put a handfull of <hi>Salt</hi> in the Pikes Belly; then take ſo much water, with a pinte of Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar: if the <hi>Pike</hi> be any thing large, you muſt put in at leaſt three handfull of Salt, with a bunch of Roſemary, Thyme, and ſweet Marjoram, and two or three green
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54574:10"/>
Onyons; boyle your liquor very well with a high fire made of wood; then put in your <hi>Pike,</hi> cover your Kettle, with your Bellows keep your Kettle boiling verie high for the ſpace of halfe an houre or thereabouts: a <hi>Pike</hi> asketh great boiling: for the Sauce, it is ſweet Butter well beaten with ſome of the top of the ſame liquor, with two or three Antchovaes, the skin taken off, and the bones taken out, a little Vinegar, ſo garnish your Dish: when your <hi>Pike</hi> is Dished, take the juyce of a Lemmon and put on the top of the fish: there is no doubt but it is good victuall.</p>
            <p>I could ſet downe as many wayes to dreſs Eeles, as would furniſh a Lords Table: but I will relate but one.</p>
            <p>Take off the skinne whole, till you come within two inches of the taile, beginning at the head: take out the Intrailes, waſh the Eele cleane, drie it with a cloth, ſcotch it all along both the ſides; take ſome Pepper and Salt, mixe them together, rub the Eele well with the Pepper, and Salt; draw the skinne on againe whole; tye the skinne about the head with a little thred lapped round, broyled on a Charcoale fire, let your Grid-iron be hot, rub your Grid-iron with ſome ruffe Suet; the skinne will not burne; this is good; but take the skin off, and ſtew the Eele betwixt two Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, on a Chafing-diſh of Coals, with ſweet Butter, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar, and beaten Cinnamon, they will be better.</p>
            <p>The boyling of a Carp is the very ſame way as I have ſhewed for the Trout, the ſcales on: no better Sauce can be made then the Antchovaes Sauce. The high boyling is the way for all freſh-water Fish: I have ſerved ſeven times ſeven years, to ſee the experiment.</p>
            <p>If there be any Gentleman that liveth adjoyning to a River ſide, where Trouts are; I will ſhew the way to bring them to feed, that he may ſee them at his pleaſure;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54574:11"/>
and to bring ſtore to the place. Gather great Garden-Wormes, the quantity of a pinte, or a quart, chop them in pieces, and throw them where you intend to have your pleaſure; with feeding often, there is no doubt of their comming; they will come as Sheep to the Pen: you muſt begin to feed with peeces of worms, by hand, by one and one, untill you ſee them eat; then you may feed with Liver or Lights, ſo your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire will be effected. And thus I conclude this ſhort Treatiſe.</p>
