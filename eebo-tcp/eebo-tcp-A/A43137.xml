            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42085:3"/>faſhionable diſguiſe to the end of the world; yet neither of theſe <hi>deluſions</hi> ever have been, or can be ſo <hi>ſtrong</hi> or ſubtile as to elude all means of diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: For though a <hi>lying wonder</hi> may be Mechaniſm or Conſpiracy be ſo perform'd as to puzzle a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry curious enquiry into the matter of fact only, and <hi>a Sanctimonious vizor</hi> may be ſo accurately made, as to ſtartle an unwary admirer that gazes only on the outſide of it; yet a careful ſearch into the integrity, charity, and humility of <hi>the perſon,</hi> will certainly diſcover the forgery; counterfeit power and purity taſt alwayes very ſtrong of malice and pride.</p>
            <p>But, thanks be to <hi>God,</hi> we cannot pretend the danger, nor plead the excuſe of ſuch temptations; ſuch is the honeſt genius of <hi>our Religion,</hi> that it dazzles not our Eyes with any ſtrange feats, nor deafs our Ears with unintelligible ſounds, nor amuſes our Minds with uncouth ſeverities, nor of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers any other Proofs for it ſelf, then thoſe its great Maſter hath left it, ſave only the ſtrange ſucceſs of them, againſt the will and intereſt of the greateſt power and policy in the world. VVe are then ſafe from this firſt evil, unleſs we will be ſo humorous as to cheat our ſelves into the <hi>belief of lyes,</hi> which is the ſecond part of their ſad condition.</p>
            <p>To rake up the aſhes of <hi>old Heretiques,</hi> would be here as uſeleſs, as unſavory, and to rake into the wounds of <hi>our own Church,</hi> to ſeek the <hi>Lye,</hi> would be as barbarous; Some Balſom we rather take from
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42085:4"/>the words, for the healing of the ſore of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> if it be not yet incurable; <hi>viz,</hi> Every falſe Perſwaſion doth not amount to this <hi>emphaſis</hi> of error, nor muſt we write on it the doom in my Text, leſt we fall under our own condemnation: A ſmall miſtake may indeed, as 'tis menag'd, grow up to the dimenſions of a <hi>groſs error,</hi> let the vehicle be never ſo innocent, the ingredients make it a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poyſon; But a <hi>lye</hi> is an error which carries its contradiction in its face not at the end of a long chain of conſequences hookt artificially together; which is ſo thick and palpable, that not <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy</hi> onely, but even <hi>Humanity</hi> checks at it, as <hi>being repugnant to that ſenſe or teſtimony which is current through the whole world;</hi> And of this nature there are too many extant: I will not ſearch into this or the other ſect, or communion for them, onely lay down ſome general undeniable <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters,</hi> and whatſoever Doctrines or Propoſitions anſwer them, I hope 'twill be no rudeneſs or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to leave the <hi>lye</hi> at their doors.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Thoſe that deny the being, or providence of God,</hi> cannot juſtly be angry at that reproach, which they roundly put upon the whole world; All men <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> yea their very <hi>Idols</hi> and <hi>Altars,</hi> and the <hi>whole Creation,</hi> do with one conſent condemn theſe; yea, ſo far do they contradict themſelves, that they give the making and menagement of the whole world to ſuch a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42085:4"/>blind Power, which they dare not truſt with the care of that little pittance of it they call their own; And however ſportive men may, in the tranſports of their pleaſures, be with <hi>God;</hi> yet this argues the denial of him to be the greateſt falſity, that it needs ſo much confidence and wildneſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all things that are venerable amongſt men, to ſupport it.

            <p>A ſad charge, as heavy as the doom! That it imports more then bare Infidelity, is plain from the words, which ſignifie,</p>
            <p n="1">1. An unworthy reception of truth; they recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not <hi>the love</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The defeating the deſign of it; were not <hi>ſaved</hi> by it.</p>
            <p>There are too many that receive the <hi>Doctrines and Promiſes of a holy Life</hi> (for that is the ſpecifical ſenſe of <hi>truth</hi> in the <hi>holy Scripture</hi>) with ſcorn and contempt, who, diſdaining the ſneaking guilt of the triflers in my Text, aſpire to that of Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers of <hi>Truth,</hi> for whom therefore a more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful judgment then that here (if any can be ſo)

            <p>A third ſort receive it with a zealous fondneſs, with Paſſions and Raptures, yet not it, but the phraſe, the tone, the action that conveighs it; For let the ſame truth be read in a Leſſon, in a lower key, and with a more compos'd behaviour, and it looſes its warm entertainment.</p>
            <p>And what is all this but flattery and falſhood? It may be the love of ſomething that is agreeable to the Ears, as ſweet Accents or ſmooth Periods are, let the matter be ſerious or frivolous; or to the Fancy, as ſuch diſcourſes as ſooth mens particular tempers, whether they are true or falſe; or to the Underſtanding, as a well-fram'd Hypotheſis of the motions of the Planets; But all this, even the <hi>cleareſt notion of truth</hi> falls ſhort of the <hi>love of it;</hi> This admits it beyond all the chambers of imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and diſcourſe, into the treaſures the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Soul, ſeats it there in full power, caſts out whatſoever is diſtaſtful to it, and ſubjects all

            </p>
            <p>This is their Charge,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.18.</note> 
               <hi>Holding the truth of God in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> or (as in the next verſe to the Text 'tis phras'd) <hi>not believing in the truth, but having pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> as if that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure were flat without the reſiſtance of <hi>Truth</hi> to keen the appetite, as if the wayes to death were not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42085:7"/>plain enough without the <hi>light of the Goſpel</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them thither, and 'twere a glorious conqueſt through all the forces of <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Love, Mercy</hi> and <hi>Vengeance,</hi> to do <hi>violence to the Kingdom of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and ſtorm Hell and Damnation.</p>
            <p>This is the Charge, and how it fits men for this doom, and prepares them for the <hi>groſſeſt errors</hi> I am next to ſhew.</p>
            <p>The cleareſt Principles of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Reaſon</hi> are not ſo convincing as the <hi>Doctrines of a holy life,</hi> which, as the light, bring their own evidence with them, and approve themſelves at firſt ſight to be <hi>holy, juſt and good;</hi> And the <hi>groſſeſt errors</hi> cannot be preſs't with ſuch palpable abſurdities, as any <hi>great and wilful wickedneſs,</hi> which the conſcience confutes, not by formal argument, but with pain and ſhame and confuſion of face, and leaves it no evaſion, or defence but that which amounts to a denial, extenuation: He therefore that is grown ſo hardy as to reſiſt the ſtrongeſt convictions of his own conſcience, and to baffle the painful conflicts of his own ſpirit, who can hear and feel, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe his own condemnation, how eaſie a conqueſt will he make over the weaker perſwaſions of his mind? The ſtrongeſt ſenſe we have implanted by Nature, or renew'd by Grace in our Souls, is, That <hi>of Good and Evil,</hi> which, becauſe 'tis the Guardian of our Innocence and Safety, therefore hath <hi>God</hi> made it ſo quick and apprehenſive, The ſenſe of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42085:8"/>
               <hi>True and Falſe</hi> is much more weak and languid, like the laſt faint returns of a dying eccho; If <hi>that</hi> therefore be grown ſtupid, how can <hi>this</hi> continue in its vigour? When once a man is grown ſo ſenſleſs as to lay by all reverence and pitty of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to endure his own torments and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, he may eaſily deſpiſe the weaker chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ſharpeſt demonſtrations. Beſides, there is <hi>no great ſin</hi> but is attended with ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per miſchiefs which touch the evil man in thoſe parts wherein he is far more ſenſible and tender, then in any the faculties of his Soul, with which either his Body, or his Credit, or his Subſtance are <hi>weary and heavy laden;</hi> And can we think the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> of ſuch a mans Faith can be dearer to him then his <hi>Health,</hi> his <hi>Honour,</hi> or his <hi>Eſtate,</hi> which he ſo readily ſacrifices to his Sins? or, That a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction ſhould trouble his mind, who hath no compaſſion left for theſe? Can the harſheſt diſcords give any offence to thoſe Ears that have been tun'd onely to curſing and calumny? or the moſt ill-ſhapt unproportion'd objects to thoſe Eyes that have delighted in the uglieſt deformities of their own natures? No more offence can the moſt inconſiſtent untruths give him, <hi>who being paſt feeling,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.19.</note> 
               <hi>hath given himſelf over to work all unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with greedineſs.</hi> Thus doth wickedneſs harden and enure the mind for the groſſeſt errors: and the more,</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:42085:8"/>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe it expoſes a man to all <hi>temptations,</hi> and makes him a ready prey for any belief that comes arm'd with the ſame weapons, he hath been ſo often worſted with; If Pleaſure, Honour, and Profit can make a man a Beaſt, a Villain or a Knave, they may as eaſily, where they ſtand for it, make him an Infidel or Apoſtate; If the ſmiles of a friend can ſtrip a man of his <hi>Humanity,</hi> they will ſhake his <hi>Creed,</hi> which ſits not ſo cloſe to him; He who abandons his <hi>Innocency</hi> for a little Railery, would ſure be quickly ſtorm'd out of his <hi>Faith;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what ſpeak I of temptation? He that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in his wickedneſs in defiance to truth needs no <hi>Tempter,</hi> being of himſelf propenſe to invent, or imbrace the <hi>groſſeſt lies.</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="3">3. There are two great depths of darkneſs, whence all thoſe Miſts that be-night mens Underſtandings do ariſe, an <hi>evil conſcience</hi> and <hi>evil affections;</hi> both which have their riſe and growth from an <hi>evil life,</hi> and do beguile men with a ſubtler ſophiſtry, then all outward impoſture, which borrows all its force from them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The evil Conſcience works thus.</hi> To the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive delicate ſenſe of the Soul the evil of guilt is very afflictive; The remembrances of Blood, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine, Oppreſſion, Cozenage, and the like, are not onely frightful ſights, but cruel furies to a man; Something then muſt be done for his eaſe, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live on this wheel, nor lie down with this fire
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42085:9"/>in his boſome, nor can he ſhift off theſe Tortures that ſtick as cloſe to him as the knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf does; The common diverſions of noiſe, jolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and buſineſs will not alwayes laſt, he muſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be alone, and then the Tormenters return; Thus like the evil Spirit in the Goſpel, <hi>He goes about ſeeking reſt, and can find none;</hi> The onely ſure and Catholick Remedy of <hi>Repentance from dead works,</hi> (which by the <hi>Blood of Jeſus,</hi> and the <hi>Promiſe of the Spirit,</hi> we are aſſur'd will be ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) is harſh and ſevere, and requires <hi>cutting off the gangrend Hand, and pulling out the enflam'd Eye,</hi> and other rigours he can no more endure then the diſtemper; 'tis a long and heavy way to the City of Refuge, and when one is there 'tis but an impriſonment. In this diſtreſs ſome Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft muſt be ſought to, ſome eaſier arts found out to palliate the evil, and aſſwage the pain. And for this he hath heard much talk of a goodly and cheap <hi>Robe of Righteouſneſs,</hi> and a choice fucus of <hi>Faith,</hi> with which he may ſo cover and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the monſters, that the all-ſeeing Eye of the <hi>moſt holy God</hi> ſhall not ſee ſin in them; In this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe he preſently puts them, and having thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd them, he apprehends no terror in them; Thus thouſands ſwallow <hi>this enthuſiaſtick lye,</hi> for indeed 'tis very delicious, and gives a great deal of eaſe to the vileſt Sinner, without the leaſt trouble or diſtur bance to his Sin.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:42085:9"/>
            <p>But if the man be frighted out of this phancy into a thoughtful mood, and being arreſted with the ſenſe of God, ſees his nakedneſs through theſe Figleaves, and feels that for all his finery he is yet in pain, and ſomething muſt be done beſides this <hi>mummery</hi> for his eaſe, he next caſts about for what is eaſie, not ſure; And being told, that a ſlight expoſing the evil, by a ſhort confeſſion, a very little attrition, and a round ſatisfaction to the Church, by the help of a few omnipotent words, and in the cloſe of all, a little healing unction, will infallibly effect the cure, and lay theſe terrors; Having ſo <hi>venerable authority</hi> for it, he takes the opiate, which lulls him into a pleaſant <hi>ſlumber and gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs;</hi> and now he cryes, <hi>Soul, take thy eaſe,</hi> and luſt, take thy liberty, and whenſoever the terrors do return, 'tis but repeating the remedy, <hi>Toties, quoties,</hi> and all will be well; But if the charge of this (as the cheapneſs of the other) render it ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious, if reaſon do awaken the man, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him that <hi>God</hi> cannot be impoſed upon by ſuch thin deviſes; and after all his vain trials, he finds 'tis not poſſible by theſe poor crafts to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile <hi>the ſenſe of his God and his Guilt,</hi> ſo as they may peaceably abide together; Having firſt reſolv'd to live and die in his dear wickedneſs, he then ſees it's neceſſary wholly to diſcharge his mind of the firſt great troubler of his reſt, as that which he is moſt deſirous, and will coſt him leaſt to part with: And
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42085:10"/>when he hath well <hi>exorcis'd</hi> the ſenſe of <hi>God,</hi> and ſinn'd himſelf into the hope that he is not, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauds himſelf in that eaſe and freedome that he hath forc't and abus'd his Soul into.</p>
            <p>That this is the uſual method Guilt puts men upon for a little temporary eaſe, is a plain and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent obſervation; It ſets out at <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> and ends in <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> betwixt which how diſtant ſoever they ſeem, there is but one ſhort ſtage, <hi>viz. Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition:</hi> Thus the groſſeſt Lyes become a needful Sanctuary,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>when</hi> Hymaeneus <hi>and</hi> Alexander <hi>put away their Conſcience, they were forc't to ſend their Faith after it,</hi> which would have been very uneaſie to them without it; Thus when men have ſpent their Innocence in riotous courſes, they muſt (<hi>as the Prodigal in the Goſpel</hi>) ſet up ſome ſordid way of living, <hi>ſerve Swine and dyet with them,</hi> to ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The other things that ſo corrupt the mind, as to make it greedy of the <hi>groſſeſt Lyes,</hi> are <hi>evil af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> which cannot be maintain'd nor gratifi'd without them. So are we fram'd that there is little <hi>dry light</hi> in us, our apprehenſions are deeply tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctur'd, if not form'd by our affections; <hi>We believe with the heart,</hi> is as true in <hi>Philoſophy</hi> as 'tis in <hi>Scripture,</hi> for mens moſt unconcerning ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſavour ſomething of the love or reverence wherewith they imbib'd them, how much more their moral and religious perſwaſions? when once therefore the <hi>affections</hi> of men are by their <hi>evil
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42085:10"/>practices</hi> turn'd into brutiſh, or diabolical, they change all things, their Gods, Religions, Creeds, Commandments, Heaven and Hell into their own complexions; How exactly did the <hi>Idols</hi> of the <hi>Heathen</hi> ſuit with their tempers, and the notions too many Chriſtians have of <hi>their God,</hi> with their own deprav'd diſpoſitions? How agreeable to a cruel and ſavage mind is the <hi>Mahumetan zeal,</hi> and their <hi>Paradiſe</hi> to the Intemperate and Unclean? How proper is the temporal reign of <hi>their King Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> to the revengeful and ambitious? How greedily do they ſuck in the breath that declaims againſt good works who are griping and niggardly? How welcome are the new wayes of Salvation by <hi>phancy</hi> or <hi>proxy</hi> to the delicate and lazy? How taſtful is the Doctrine againſt Spirits to a mind that is carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd? and the news of <hi>no God</hi> to thoſe who <hi>would have none of his Laws?</hi> Men fix their <hi>belief</hi> where they place their <hi>happineſs,</hi> and a little perſwaſion will ſerve to rid their thoughts of that which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs their paſſage to it; Soon did the <hi>Indian</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> when he found it obliged him to renounce his dearer <hi>Paganiſm;</hi> But whatſoever ſtory ſooths and cheriſhes their luſts, that firſt ſwells their wiſhes into hopes, their hopes into poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities, and theſe into luſty demonſtrations that it is true; For this reaſon the <hi>Apoſtle St. James</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us <hi>to lay aſide all filthyneſs,</hi>

            <p>The great concernment that he owns, and muſt (as he is God) neceſſarily have in all the affairs of the world, gives men occaſion to <hi>lay all their burthens</hi> upon him in the worſt ſenſe, that is, if they are blind, wicked, and unhappy, they cry out preſently (as he in the Tragedy) againſt, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>From what hath been ſaid of this, I ſhall raiſe three Concluſions.</p>
