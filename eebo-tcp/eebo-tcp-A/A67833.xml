            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Obligation was so natural for me to be Your Preacher, that my declining the Office would have look'd like want of Affection; and this was the Reason why I did not decline it, as otherwise I should have done, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of that great Indisposition of Body which has of late afflicted me. It is the Wisdom of those that are Well, but the Necessity of the Sick, to think upon Awful things; And at the time when You came to bespeak me for Your Service, a Thought of that sort was lying upon my mind, which I found apposite to determine my Subject: That Thought I pursued into the Sermon which I now Publish; and the more willingly, because part of its Matter seems to me to come too little into pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Consideration; although there are not many Things we can consider, that are of greater mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Christian Living. Let me deal familiarly with You, and desire You to make Your self Judge
<pb facs="tcp:56898:3"/>
in the case; Peruse this Sermon sometimes at a retired hour, and contemplate the naked Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is purely Scriptural (for I would not be interpreted to recommend any thing in it that is Mine,) and tell me whether You do not find it well conducing to the great End You aim at; which is (I know) to be a Good Man, and to finish those Commendable Respects which You bear to Your King, Church, and Country, with a just and proper Sense of God: To whose Blessing I heartily recommend You, and rest</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>HEB. iv. 13.</bibl>
               <q>—But all things are naked and opened to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>AFter that the Law has provided against Ungodliness and Wrong never so wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the Magistrate attended on its Execution never so Diligently; yet still Human Justice will find great Obstruction from the bare want of Evidence: Facts will be Obscure; and Circumstances Doubtful, and Allegations Presumptive, and Testimonies Inconsistent; so that the <hi>probably</hi> Guilty must often go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punish'd, lest the <hi>possibly</hi> Innocent should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; which would be the greater Evil of the Two.</p>
            <p>But my Text points at a Tribunal set above the reach of this Obstruction: a Tribunal where
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56898:4"/>
all the Matters of Cognisance are throughly Known, and the Proofs all ready for Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Evidence as unexceptionable as the Justice.</p>
            <p>And this is the very Scope of the Words: Wherein we have (1.) God set forth as the Judge, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>with whom we have to do,</hi> so runs our Translation; but it is somewhat short of expressing the Original; which signifies more fully, <hi>To whom we are to give an Account:</hi> For <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> when it is applyed to Matters in Charge, signifies an Account: As when it is said to the <hi>Unjust Steward (Luke</hi> xvi. 2.) <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; we render it <hi>Give an Account of thy Stewardship.</hi> So then <hi>We are to give an Account unto God:</hi> This is the First In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of the Text.</p>
            <p>And then (2.) to intimate that This Account shall be Clearly taken, and the Judgment upon it lyable to no Exceptions for want of Evidence; It tells us, that <hi>To the Eyes of our Judge all things are Naked and Opened,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifies that which has <hi>no Outward Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> signifies that <hi>whose Inside may be look'd into:</hi> For it signifies prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily a Beast opened down the Chine; as it was the Manner of the Priests to Chine the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56898:4"/>
and open it <hi>so</hi> that the state and found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of every Entrail might appear. And thus All things we do are <hi>so</hi> Manifest unto God, that they are not capable of any Covering; either from <hi>without</hi> by Secrecy or Collusion, or from <hi>within</hi> by Palliation or Denial.</p>
            <p>The Words therefore are an Argument for a Circumspect and Upright Conversation, drawn both from the Omniscience, and the Justice of God; Because God <hi>Knows</hi> all things, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause He will <hi>Judge</hi> all things. But I shall not <hi>now</hi> meddle with the Second Part of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Gods Justice; I shall confine my self to the Consideration of his Omniscience: And in Treating of this, I shall not take in the whole Extent or the Attribute, (as whereby God knows the Nature, State, Qualities, Defects, Powers, and Possibilities of <hi>All Things,</hi> that either Are, or Can be) but I shall speak only to <hi>Those Things</hi> for which we stand Accountable; As the Scope of my Text prescribes me.</p>
            <p>Now the things for which we stand Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable are of three Kinds, <hi>(viz.) Actions, Words</hi> and <hi>Thoughts;</hi> For Each of These are capable of Moral Good and Evil, and <hi>as so</hi> they make up the matter of our Account. My Business therefore shall be,</p>
            <list>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:56898:5"/>
               <item>I. To shew that God does Know Each of these Things: and then</item>
               <item>II. To make some Reflections upon the Doctrine, that may farther conduce to Practice.</item>
            </list>
            <p>That God knows all our Actions, Words and Thoughts, the Scripture is every where Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press. And,</p>
            <p n="1">I. As to our <hi>Actions. Thou art about my path, and about my bed, and spiest out all my ways,</hi> says the Psalmist, <hi>Psal.</hi> cxxxix. 3. And lest we should interpret that this Inspection of God was Peculiar upon the Actions of that particular Man; <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us that the same Inspection is of Universal extent; <hi>Prov.</hi> xv. 3. <hi>For the eyes of the Lord are in every place, beholding the evil and the good:</hi> whence it is Evident that God not only <hi>can</hi> Know, if he <hi>will,</hi> but likewise that he actually <hi>wills</hi> to Know all that we do. It is Profane to imagine that the Divine Nature is Incurious or Regardless: And accordingly it is observable that as Holy <hi>David</hi> calls it <hi>Brutishness</hi> to think in any Case that God does <hi>not Know</hi> what we do; <hi>Understand, O ye brutish among the people, he that formed the eye, shall not he see?</hi> So he calls it Blasphemy to think that God does not <hi>Regard</hi> what we do; <hi>How long shall the wicked blaspheme God, saying, thou God carest not for it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:56898:5"/>II. As to our <hi>Words.</hi> — <hi>There is not a word, in my tongue, but that thou knowest it altogether;</hi> says the Psalmist, <hi>Psal.</hi> cxxxix. 4. And to bring this Home to every ones case, <hi>The Author of the Book of Wisdom,</hi> Ch. i. 10. tell us, that <hi>Gods ear is the ear of jealousie;</hi> that is, an Ear not only Quick of hearing, but likewise always Intent to hear; so that when we sometimes speak that which either Shame or Fear will not suffer us to speak <hi>aloud,</hi> yet the Caution of Whispering will not conceal it from God: For (as that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor goes on) <hi>The ear of jealousie heareth all things; and the noise of whisperings is not hid; and there is no word so secret, that it shall pass for nought.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. As to our <hi>Thoughts,</hi> that is Inclusively, our Deliberations, Judgments, Choices, Wishes and Desires, the <hi>Searcher of hearts</hi> is acquainted with them All. So says Holy <hi>Job,</hi> Ch. xlii. 2. <hi>I know that no thought can be witholden from thee.</hi> But the Psalmist speaks yet Higher to the Point, and cries <hi>Psal.</hi> cxxxix. 1. <hi>Thou knowest my thoughts long before:</hi> Thou Knowest my Thoughts long <hi>Before;</hi> even <hi>Before</hi> they are Conceived. Nor does this Expression give any ground to Argue, that because God <hi>foreknows</hi> our Thoughts (as likewise he does our Actions) that therefore he does <hi>Predetermine</hi> and <hi>Ordain</hi> them; This would
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:56898:6"/>
be clearly to acquit <hi>our selves,</hi> and to charge <hi>God</hi> with the Fault of our Miscarriages: And I doubt not but many would fain have the Charge run <hi>so,</hi> and therefore are Fond of this Opinion: But on the contrary, as <hi>God tempts no man</hi> (in the Words of S. <hi>James</hi>) so much less does he <hi>force</hi> or <hi>predetermine</hi> any one to Sin: No, He leaves us to our Liberty to Think either Better or Worse, and yet this notwithstanding he <hi>foreknows</hi> our Thoughts; Because, Having an Intimate Knowledge of the State of our Souls, of all the Affections, Passions, Springs, and Weights wherewith they are moved, he knows Infallibly how every possible Object, that presents it self <hi>will</hi> determine our Judgments and Choices, tho He <hi>himself</hi> does not Determine them <hi>at all.</hi> As the Man that <hi>sees the Setting</hi> of the Chimes, can tell <hi>several hours before</hi> what Tune they will Play, without any Positive Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence either upon their Setting, or their Playing.</p>
            <p>Thus the Scriptures represent the <hi>Omniscience</hi> of God. And farther, they offer us <hi>Two Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Considerations,</hi> whereby this Notion may be better cleared, and the Conviction of it made to set Firmer upon our Minds.</p>
            <p>The <hi>First Consideration</hi> is that of Gods <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence:</hi> the <hi>Second</hi> is that of his <hi>Power.</hi>
            </p>

Gods <hi>Presence</hi> is that which we call an <hi>Omnipresence,</hi> that is an Universal Presence, In all places, and with all persons: And this the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Book of Wisdom</hi> makes his <hi>Argument</hi> for Gods Omniscience, Ch. i. 7. <hi>God</hi> (says he) <hi>is witness of the reins, and a true beholder of the heart, and a hearer of the tongue; For</hi> (this is the Proof of it, because) <hi>the spirit of the Lord filleth the world:</hi> that is, God <hi>Knows Every Thing,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he <hi>Is Every Where.</hi> And the Psalmist as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serting the Omniscience of God at large, <hi>Psal.</hi> cxxxix. confirms his Argument, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcates the Belief of the Doctrine with <hi>This</hi> Reflection, ver. 6. <hi>Whither shall I go from thy spirit? Or whither shall I flee from thy Presence? If I climb up to heaven, thou art there; and if I go down to hell, thou art there also,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now this Consideration of the Omnipresence of God is useful and proper to prevent those Mistakes in our Opinion of Him, which we are wont to take up by Thinking of him <hi>Weakly,</hi> i. e. <hi>with Resemblance to our selves.</hi> For <hi>so,</hi> In Our First Thoughts, we are apt to <hi>Confine</hi> God to a <hi>Place,</hi> and to <hi>Limit</hi> him to a <hi>Distance</hi> in the Perception of Things; <hi>Because we our selves</hi> are so Limited and Confined. And so we are apt to imagine that a <hi>Constant Inspection</hi> and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56898:7"/>
of <hi>all</hi> Men, and <hi>all</hi> their Actions would beget either Trouble or Weariness, or Distraction in God; <hi>because</hi> any Great Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does so in us. Most of the Great Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathens were overtaken with these Prejudices. Whereas, on the Contrary, the Notion of Gods <hi>Being Every where</hi> Leads our Understanding to apprehend that it is as Easie for Him to observe <hi>Every</hi> Man, as <hi>One</hi> Man; and <hi>Every</hi> Action, as <hi>One Single</hi> Action of our Lives. Remember therefore that God is as <hi>near to our Mouth,</hi> when we Speak, as that Man is, that <hi>Leans his Ear</hi> to our Whispers: He is as <hi>near</hi> to our Actions, when we act in <hi>Secret,</hi> as they are whom we admit into our Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy: He is as <hi>near</hi> to our Thoughts, when we Purpose, Wish, or Design any thing, as is <hi>Our own Soul</hi> that conceives them; and in Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence he is as Familiarly acquainted with them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second Consideration</hi> which the Scripture offers to inculcate the belief of God's Omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is that of his <hi>Power, viz.</hi> that Plastick Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Power, whereby he is the Fountain and Author of all our Beings: From which Topick the Psalmist <hi>thus</hi> argues: <hi>Psal.</hi> xciv. 9, 10. <hi>He that planted the ear, shall not he hear? He that formed the eye, shall not he see? He that teacheth
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56898:7"/>
man knowledge, shall not he know?</hi> The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (You see) reaches each Particular of my Matter, <hi>Words, Deeds</hi> and <hi>Thoughts;</hi> and to shew the Strength of it, I shall consider it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more exactly. If we resolve it into a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Form of Reasoning, it may run thus; All our Faculties of Knowing, all our Organs and Instruments of Information we have from God, and can we think then that <hi>God wants</hi> any for his Own Use? All of us are his Creatures, and can we think he has made any Creature of such a Capacity as to act any thing beside his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, or beyond his Comprehension? This would be a Weak, and (as the Psalmist calls it) a <hi>Brutish</hi> Imagination. But to come to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Instances.</p>
            <p>God <hi>hath planted the Ear, and Formed the Eye:</hi> And yet when all is done, 'Tis neither our Ear that hears, nor our Eye that sees; but 'tis our <hi>Spirit</hi> that hears and sees through these, as its proper <hi>Instruments.</hi> 'Tis our Spirit therefore only that has the <hi>Power</hi> of Hearing and Seeing: And tho <hi>Our</hi> Spirits are limited to the Use and Assistance of <hi>such Instruments,</hi> we must not therefore imagine but that Spirits of a <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Order</hi> can perform all <hi>Their</hi> Perceptions <hi>without</hi> Them. To think otherwise would be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56898:8"/>
as Absurd, as if a Man of <hi>Weak</hi> Eyes should argue that it is Impossible for <hi>Any</hi> Eye to see <hi>without</hi> a Glass. When therefore God or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels are said to have Ears or Eyes, 'tis only in Accommodation to our Mode of Thinking; For when we come to Reason upon the Subject we must acknowledge that it is Part of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to <hi>need no such Helps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas therefore, First, We account that the Sense of Hearing is <hi>Limited</hi> to a Respective Distance; And <hi>this</hi> Thought makes us Bold to <hi>whisper</hi> that, which we dare not Speak aloud; However we account of our <hi>Own</hi> Hearing, we ought not to esteem <hi>That of Others</hi> to be so Limited. Nay when we find by Experience that the Softest Whisper, when conveyed by a <hi>Smooth or Hollow</hi> Surface, will reach our Ear distinctly, though at a great distance from the Speaker; We have so little reason to doubt whether <hi>God hears</hi> our Whispers, that we may be sure (on the other hand) he can command a small Ring of Air to carry our Whispers to the End of the Earth, and make them heard by whoever <hi>else</hi> he pleases. And by <hi>This very Means</hi> the Prophet <hi>Elisha</hi> might hear <hi>what was spoken in the King of</hi> Assyria's <hi>Bed-Chamber, 2 Kings</hi> vi. 12. as well as by the Intercourse or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of an Angel.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:56898:8"/>II. Though <hi>Our act of Seeing</hi> be confin'd to the Assistance of <hi>Outward Light;</hi> we must not conclude <hi>That of Others is so: If I say, per adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture darkness shall cover me, then shall my night be turned into day: the darkness is no darkness with thee; the light and darkness to thee are both alike:</hi> says the <hi>Psalmist.</hi> Nay, we may learn from the <hi>most Contemptible</hi> Creatures, that <hi>Outward Light</hi> is not <hi>Necessary</hi> to Seeing; For the <hi>Batt</hi> and the <hi>Owl</hi> can See <hi>without</hi> it: And perhaps Providence designed these Contemptible Creatures to teach us the Lesson, <hi>that Darkness is no Covering;</hi> and to provoke unto Jealousie and Apprehension that Thousands may see our Retired Actions, whom we see not, and therefore foolishly are not Aware of them: Good Spirits can see us and lament, and Evil Spirits can see us and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at the Issues of our sin and folly.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>It is God that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?</hi> We allow that God gives us the whole Faculty and Power of Knowing; And, if so, to think that we can know any thing in our selves, which God does <hi>not</hi> Know, is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction; for it implies that we have power to Know something <hi>without</hi> God.</p>
            <p>The most awful Faculty that God has given us, and that which lies most under our present
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56898:9"/>
Consideration is that of Knowing or <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring what we have done,</hi> together with the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciousness of that Good or Evil that is in it: Now let us consider how this Faculty performs its Office: How come we to Know at any time what we have <hi>Spoken, Done,</hi> or <hi>Thought,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter once those Acts of Speaking, Doing, or Thinking are past? Is it not by seeing the <hi>Images</hi> or <hi>Impressions</hi> which those several Acts do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce within us? Do we not by seeking find such Images of things, which we have Spoken, Done, or Thought of several years before? Nay do not those Images frequently present themselves <hi>without</hi> our seeking, and make us see them whether we will or no? Which is a Proof that they have a Real Being and Lasting Subsistence within us, and are wholly Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on our Will; for we cannot extinguish or erase any of them at our Pleasure; we cannot do it, would we never so fain. We may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore, that whatsoever we either Speak or Do, Purpose, Wish, or Design, so far as these Acts are of a Moral Concern, and bear Relation to Virtue or Vice, they leave the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of themselves upon our Consciences, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed there in Characters Fair and Intelligible, nay I may add, <hi>Indelible</hi> too: For though it must
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56898:9"/>
be allowed that we Forget many things which we have been Conscious of; yet in that Case, the Notices of such things are not <hi>Erased</hi> or <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished,</hi> they are only <hi>Covered over.</hi> There is no <hi>Forgetfulness</hi> in a Spirit; <hi>Its</hi> Forgetfulness is only Accidental, and occasioned by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments of the Flesh: As we may observe that sometimes a Man of a Faithful Memory, will by the Disorder of a Sickness grow Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and <hi>forget</hi> all that ever he Knew; and yet upon the Removal of his Disease, all his former Notices will appear Fresh again. And how Reasonable is it to believe that our Souls, whether in the State of Separation from the Body, or of Re-union to the Body when Defecated and made free from Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions (so far as <hi>All</hi> Bodies even of the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just</hi> shall be at the Resurrection) I say, how Reasonable is it to believe, that our Souls shall <hi>Then</hi> have a Clear View and <hi>perfect Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi> of <hi>all</hi> that we have done; Though <hi>Now</hi> most of those Notices lie in us like the <hi>Inscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of a Marble <hi>covered</hi> over with Dust and Rubbish.</p>
            <p>Now if <hi>Conscience</hi> be <hi>thus</hi> like a <hi>Written Book,</hi> and Faithful Register of our Behaviour, there is no room to doubt but <hi>God can read</hi> that Book,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56898:10"/>
as well as <hi>we:</hi> Nay, He can Read through all those <hi>Impediments</hi> that Shade it, which we <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not:</hi> Nay he can, when he pleases, make this Book <hi>Legible to all Others,</hi> as much as it is to our selves. For He can so far <hi>Elevate the Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of all Men, or <hi>Open their Eyes</hi> (in that Sense that he is said to have <hi>opened the eyes of</hi> Elisha's <hi>servant, that he might see the host of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels:</hi> 2 Kings vi. 14.) I say, God can open the Eyes of all Men to such a <hi>Spiritual Intuition,</hi> as that <hi>All</hi> shall be able, at a short glance, to Read <hi>each others</hi> History (imprinted on their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences in <hi>Intelligible Signatures</hi>) as <hi>familiarly</hi> as if it were <hi>graven</hi> on their foreheads, or <hi>printed</hi> in a Book. And <hi>thus</hi> we may probably Conceive that <hi>those Books</hi> mentioned by the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> Ch. vii. 10. and by S. John <hi>in his Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Ch. xx. 12. <hi>Books</hi> that are to be <hi>opened</hi> in order to the <hi>Universal Judgment,</hi> are no other than that <hi>Volume</hi> of things Recorded in every Mans Conscience; which being opened and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to View, shall make (as it were) a Tally or <hi>Counterpart</hi> to that <hi>Memorial</hi> which God himself Keeps of <hi>all</hi> we do.</p>
            <p>Having said <hi>thus much</hi> for the Stating or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Gods Omniscience, I shall <hi>now</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to make some Reflections upon the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56898:10"/>
that may farther conduce to Practice.</p>
            <p>God Almighty has planted <hi>Two</hi> Passions in our Souls; whose most proper Use is to deter us from sin; and they are <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Fear:</hi> The Object of Fear is <hi>Punishment,</hi> and the Object of Shame is <hi>Discovery:</hi> and his Omniscience does import <hi>both</hi> these Consequences to sin (<hi>viz.</hi>) that it shall be <hi>discovered,</hi> and that it shall be <hi>punish'd:</hi> For Gods Omniscience does not <hi>termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> in bare <hi>Knowing;</hi> he Sees and Knows in order to farther Acts of Justice; so he tells, <hi>Jer.</hi> xvii. 19. <hi>I the Lord search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doing.</hi> I shall not <hi>now</hi> extend my Reflections so far as the <hi>Punishment</hi> of sin (though <hi>that</hi> be of the <hi>most</hi> moving Importance) I shall insist only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Discovery</hi> of it; and shew what <hi>Shame</hi> is threatned to it from Gods Omniscience. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hereto, my first Inference from the Doctrine shall be <hi>This (viz.)</hi> That <hi>no sin</hi> can be <hi>Secret;</hi> (absolutely speaking, no sin <hi>can</hi> be so.)</p>
            <p>Now did this Notion sit so close upon our minds as it ought to do, it would necessarily be of great advantage to the Cause of Virtue; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause nothing gives more occasion to <hi>sin</hi> in the world, than the contrary Expectation, and <hi>hopes
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56898:11"/>
of Secrecy.</hi> For even after a Man has devested his Soul of <hi>Probity,</hi> he cannot so easily devest it of <hi>Shame;</hi> and therefore when he has never so strong an Inclination to sin, yet still he will <hi>start</hi> at the apprehension of being <hi>discovered;</hi> and be <hi>still</hi> willing to retain that Reputation, which is the <hi>Shadow</hi> of Virtue, though he has been so <hi>hardy</hi> as to shake hands with the <hi>substance.</hi> How many Calumnies, Dissimulations, Frauds and Falshoods; how many of all Kinds of sinful acts (wherein there is any <hi>acknowledged</hi> Baseness and Turpitude) would be absolutely prevented; if so be the Actors, when they began to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the doing of these things, were throughly persuaded that they would come <hi>to light,</hi> and be made known, and <hi>so</hi> expose them to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Reproach? Now, is not <hi>that</hi> sin <hi>sufficiently known,</hi> of which we acknowledge that <hi>God</hi> does know it? And is not the knowledge of <hi>God</hi> sufficiently <hi>Awful,</hi> since He is <hi>most</hi> of all <hi>affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by our Guilt? And how comes it to pass <hi>then</hi> that our Shame is so <hi>Jealous</hi> and <hi>Quick</hi> in regard of <hi>Men,</hi> but so <hi>remiss</hi> and <hi>languishing</hi> in regard of God? How come we to be able to <hi>blush</hi> at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of a <hi>Man seeing us;</hi> When yet the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration that <hi>God</hi> sees us, that the most <hi>Just</hi> sees our <hi>Iniquities,</hi> that the most <hi>Holy</hi> sees our <hi>Filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:56898:11"/>
that the most <hi>Loving</hi> sees our <hi>Unthankfulness,</hi> when <hi>this</hi> Consideration is not able to move the Passion or provoke a <hi>blush?</hi> For we must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that <hi>this</hi> is the common State of that Passion in us; so <hi>partial</hi> and <hi>unreasonable</hi> is our Shame; It acts as if <hi>Men</hi> alone had the Custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our Credit, and <hi>Gods Estimation</hi> were of no Importance to it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>best</hi> Reason that can be given for such an Unreasonable behaviour, can be no other than a <hi>Bad</hi> one; but I take the Best to be <hi>this, (viz.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We presume all <hi>Men</hi> to be subject in some measure to <hi>such Passions,</hi> as would <hi>tempt</hi> them (should <hi>they</hi> be acquainted with our sins) to be <hi>severe</hi> upon us, to <hi>insult</hi> over us, and to <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> our Reproach; and therefore we dare not trust our Secret, and consequently our Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with <hi>Men:</hi> But, on the other hand, we look upon God as <hi>purely Merciful;</hi> and at the same time we look upon it as an <hi>Office</hi> of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to <hi>Cover sins:</hi> So that although God knows our sins, yet we imagine he <hi>alone</hi> shall know them; <hi>For,</hi> by some method of Repentance which we propose to our selves, we hope to <hi>attone</hi> Gods displeasure; and <hi>so</hi> to have our sins both <hi>forgiven</hi> and <hi>covered,</hi> and our selves secured both from <hi>punishment</hi> and <hi>scandal</hi> too. But for
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56898:12"/>
Correction of this Mistake (for so it is) I shall draw my Inference one Step <hi>farther,</hi> and argue from the Omniscience of God:</p>
            <p n="2">II. That All sin shall be brought to an <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal</hi> and <hi>publick</hi> Discovery: so that it is but <hi>despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> hope for any Man to think he shall escape the Shame that is due unto his Guilt.</p>
            <p>That Gods Omniscience carries in it the <hi>Power</hi> of such a Discovery is no Dispute; the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, Whether he <hi>actually will</hi> make such a Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery? And let us fairly consult <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> what we ought to believe concerning <hi>this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apostle tells us (<hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 16.) that, <hi>In that day God shall judge the secrets of all men:</hi> and to signifie that the <hi>Judging</hi> of Secrets implies the <hi>Revealing</hi> of Secrets, he tells us again (1 Cor. iv. 5.) that in order to Judgment, <hi>He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest the Counsels of the heart.</hi> Again he tells us (1 <hi>Tim. iii. ult.</hi>) that of the actions of Men (both Good and Evil) <hi>Some are manifest in this life; and what are Otherwise cannot be hid.</hi> And what can be more Express than that of our Saviour (S. <hi>Luke</hi> viii. 17.) <hi>Nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known, and come abroad:</hi> Which words (as they are not capable of any <hi>adequate</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56898:12"/>
till the day of Judgment, so) the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents interpret them purely to respect the <hi>Process</hi> of That Day. Now the Importance of <hi>all</hi> these Texts is clearly <hi>this;</hi> That God will make a <hi>Discovery</hi> of all human Actions in order to his Judicial Sentence, whether of <hi>Absolution,</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that <hi>Reason</hi> can have to alledge against This, must (as I have intimated already) be founded on <hi>this supposition,</hi> That it is an <hi>Office</hi> of Mercy to <hi>Cover sins:</hi> as indeed the Scripture frequently <hi>expresses</hi> it to be. And <hi>so</hi> undoubtedly it is, <hi>During this Life; Where,</hi> if all sins were Discovered, many Men would be impeded in their Repentance, and many cut off from the opportunity of Repenting: And, <hi>besides,</hi> the World would only be so much the <hi>worse</hi> for the <hi>Example;</hi> For sin would only grow more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent and Shameless, by reason of the <hi>more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent number</hi> of its Party. But <hi>hereafter</hi> the Case will be quite <hi>otherwise: There</hi> Repentance will have no Opportunity to <hi>lose;</hi> nor Ill Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample be able to do harm any longer: And when God passes Sentence upon the Lives of Men, his Mercy will be as much exalted by the Discovery of those sins he shall <hi>pardon;</hi> as his Justice will be Cleared by the Discovery of those he shall <hi>punish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:56898:13"/>I know the <hi>main</hi> strength of the mentioned Objection must be borrowed from those places of <hi>Scripture,</hi> where the <hi>Terms</hi> of <hi>Blotting out;</hi> and <hi>Covering sins,</hi> are applied to God as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per act of his Mercy. It is holy <hi>David's</hi> Prayer; Lord, <hi>Blot out all mine Iniquities:</hi> and so he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces them <hi>Blest, whose sins are Covered:</hi> And God himself says in the Prophet (<hi>Is.</hi> xliii. 25.) <hi>I even I am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and will not remember thy sins.</hi> But <hi>now,</hi> to know the proper <hi>Meaning</hi> of these Expressions, let us begin with the <hi>Last</hi> of them, wherein God says, <hi>I will not Remember thy sins:</hi> Now it is certain that this Phrase of Gods <hi>not Remembring</hi> cannot be taken <hi>literally; because</hi> it is <hi>impossible for God to Forget;</hi> But the Meaning is, that He <hi>will not Remember</hi> so, as to <hi>punish:</hi> And so, in like manner, by <hi>Blotting</hi> out and <hi>Covering</hi> is not meant <hi>literally</hi> the <hi>Concealing of sins,</hi> but only the <hi>Abolishing</hi> of their <hi>Condemning power.</hi> And this we may evidently confirm from the Instance of <hi>David</hi> himself, in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place where he uses these Expressions: 'Tis <hi>Psalm</hi> li. 9. where he cries, <hi>Hide thy face from my sins, O Lord, and Blot out all my misdeeds:</hi> But <hi>here</hi> his Petition is so far from meaning the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment</hi> of his sins from the Knowledge of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56898:13"/>
World, that he was then actually <hi>proclaiming</hi> them, and <hi>registring</hi> them in a Form of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, which he intended not only for the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise</hi> of his <hi>Own</hi> Repentance, but likewise for the <hi>Conduct</hi> of all <hi>Others:</hi> so that we cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret him to have deprecated the <hi>Notoriety</hi> of his sins, but merely the <hi>Wrath</hi> of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might justly have been Condemned for them.</p>
            <p>We may therefore look upon it as one Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Consequence from the Omniscience of God, that all human Actions shall be exposed to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick View and Censure; That a <hi>Light</hi> shall be struck into all the <hi>Works of Darkness, through</hi> all the Recesses of Subtlety, through all the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guises of Hypocrisie: That <hi>then</hi> the <hi>Masque</hi> shall be pull'd off from all <hi>dissembled</hi> Virtues, and every Vice shall appear in its proper Colour, and every <hi>Secret</hi> Injury shall <hi>proclaim</hi> its Author: That there shall be no <hi>summary</hi> Absolutions, no Pardons in <hi>Gross</hi> without Enquiry into the Retail, as the slight Repentances of Men do seem to require; but that <hi>Repentances</hi> shall be <hi>weighed</hi> as well as <hi>Sins;</hi> and Mercy dispensed upon <hi>Rational</hi> Terms, and the Pardon of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners <hi>justified</hi> by the Measures of their Contrition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:56898:14"/>If this Reflection can work in us any more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant Shame for what we have done amiss, it has its proper and wholesome Effect upon us. It is the hope of being <hi>Undiscovered</hi> that makes the Sinner walk <hi>haughtily;</hi> and (on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) the Belief of a Certain Discovery ought in all Reason to render us more <hi>Abject and Vile</hi> in our own Eyes; which is the first step to True Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Shame thus <hi>Taken upon our selves</hi> is the only Expedient the Sinner has to <hi>prevent</hi> the Future: <hi>Penitential</hi> shame will <hi>avoid</hi> the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, and <hi>break</hi> that Blow that will <hi>otherwise</hi> strike us with Unknown Confusion. For be assured That <hi>Shame</hi> for Sin is a <hi>Natural Debt;</hi> and it <hi>must</hi> be paid at one time or other; and we can <hi>escape</hi> it no <hi>more</hi> than we can escape <hi>Death.</hi>

            <p>Indeed there are some Men who seem to be <hi>Proof</hi> against the Influence of this Reflection; I mean <hi>such</hi> as are arriv'd to sin <hi>boldly</hi> and <hi>open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> who as they <hi>seek no Covering,</hi> so they seem to <hi>fear</hi> no Discovery, but <hi>bid Defiance</hi> to Shame. In respect of <hi>such</hi> I shall add One Reflection <hi>more,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi>) That</p>
            <p>Although the Knowledge of <hi>Men</hi> may not have the power of working Shame in a <hi>hardy</hi> Sinner; yet the Omniscience of God, when it
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56898:14"/>
comes to manifest it self, shall bring even the <hi>Shameless</hi> to Shame; and make it appear that, As Shame for sin can <hi>be escaped</hi> no more than <hi>Death,</hi> so it can be <hi>defy'd</hi> no more than <hi>Hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To open the Truth of this Assertion; Let us but consider, How it comes to pass that since sin is <hi>naturally Shameful</hi> (as being a <hi>Baffle</hi> to Man's <hi>Reason,</hi> as well as a Blow to his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) I say, since sin is <hi>naturally Shameful,</hi> how comes it to pass that Men can sin and yet not be ashamed.</p>
            <p>Now this Effect may follow from <hi>Three</hi> Causes, (1.) From <hi>Corrupt Notions.</hi> (2.) From <hi>Common Guilt:</hi> and (3.) From <hi>Impudence of Temper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. Shamelesness in sin may proceed from <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt</hi> Notions. For <hi>so</hi> it is, The <hi>World</hi> has past its <hi>Verdict,</hi> and Christians to their Scandal are led by the <hi>Anticipation,</hi> That there are <hi>some</hi> sins that <hi>have</hi> nothing <hi>shameful</hi> in them. 'Tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed perhaps that <hi>Fraud</hi> and <hi>Lying,</hi> and <hi>Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,</hi> and <hi>Perfidiousness</hi> (and the like) are of a Nature marked with Infamy; But <hi>then</hi> to be a <hi>Witty Scoffer,</hi> to be a <hi>brisk Revenger,</hi> to be <hi>stout in Intemperance,</hi> and the like, are no other then <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shionable Commendations;</hi> and <hi>why</hi> then should any be ashamed for these? <hi>Now</hi> this is a Dream that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56898:15"/>
may hold till the World be better awakened; but when all Actions shall be brought to their <hi>true Standard,</hi> as it will <hi>then</hi> appear, that to <hi>serve God</hi> is Mans greatest <hi>Honour;</hi> so it will appear, that there is Shame in <hi>every thing</hi> whereby we do <hi>offend</hi> him: And that those sins which Men <hi>boast</hi> of in the doing, are as Unworthy and Inglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as those which they acknowledge are <hi>not fit to bear the Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Common Guilt</hi> may make Men sin without Shame. For even in those sins, which the World <hi>owns</hi> for Shameful, Partnership will be able to carry off the Shame: <hi>Thus</hi> a Thief will not be ashamed to be surpriz'd by a <hi>Thief,</hi> nor an Adulterer by an <hi>Adulterer;</hi> though a Man of an Awful Character would produce a Blush from such a one at the surprize: And therefore we may Observe, that they who give themselves up to any Vice, do generally withal give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves up to <hi>Calumniating, i. e.</hi> they take pleasure to <hi>represent,</hi> or to <hi>suppose</hi> all others as <hi>bad</hi> as themselves: And <hi>all</hi> is for <hi>this</hi> very purpose, That they may beat down the Reverence that is due to any Good Example, and so <hi>contemn</hi> the Censures of all Men alike. But this is a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod that cannot take place when <hi>God</hi> comes to make the Discovery; For as <hi>his Holiness</hi> is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56898:15"/>
the Reach of <hi>Calumny;</hi> as none shall be able to say of <hi>God,</hi> that <hi>He</hi> is either <hi>Unrighteous,</hi> or <hi>Friend</hi> to those that are so; so his Awful Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure will not fail to reduce every Guilty mind to its proper Acknowledgments.</p>
            <p>But, III. That which <hi>consummates</hi> the Evil is <hi>Impudence of Temper:</hi> such as the Prophet <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> laments in the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> after that Affluence and Luxury had brought them to a great height of wickedness (Ch. vi. 15.) <hi>Were they Ashamed, when they had committed Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Nay they were not ashamed at all, neither could they blush.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Impudence</hi> is a Temper contracted by Industrious Iniquity, and raised upon the <hi>Ruins of Reason:</hi> It can be no <hi>otherwise;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Shame for sin is so <hi>Connatural</hi> to Reason, that it cannot be extinguish'd but with Reason it self. Which we may contemplate in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Madmen;</hi> the only Cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>why they are not ashamed, being <hi>this,</hi> that they want Reason to reflect upon the Turpitude of what they do. And 'tis certain that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever grows Impudent, he <hi>so far</hi> keeps Reason a Prisoner, suffers it not to act, holds it in servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to his Lusts, and so sets his Soul in the nearest approach unto Brutality.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:56898:16"/>But this is a State that will not <hi>always last:</hi> For when God comes to do Right to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Reason shall be <hi>asserted</hi> to its <hi>Liberty</hi> of acting; and <hi>then</hi> Shame shall be <hi>let loose</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>all its Arrears:</hi> It shall be let loose like an <hi>Armed Man;</hi> and undoubtedly it shall act <hi>then</hi> with the <hi>same Force</hi> upon all <hi>Bold</hi> Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours, that it does <hi>now</hi> sometimes upon those Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Souls that <hi>makes themselves away</hi> to avoid its Lashes: For as <hi>these</hi> flee from <hi>Life</hi> (though the greatest Blessing they have) so they <hi>then</hi> shall flee from God with the same Confusion; And being not able to bear the Terrour of his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, shall voluntarily betake themselves to any place that is <hi>abandoned</hi> by Him, and that is sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply <hi>Hell.</hi> So that the Impudent Sinner seems not to need any <hi>Compulsion</hi> to settle him in the <hi>place</hi> of <hi>Torment,</hi> but that of his Own Shame: <hi>That</hi> will be his <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> his <hi>proper,</hi> his <hi>natural place;</hi> To <hi>Which</hi> (we know) all things move of their <hi>own accord.</hi> And no less is intimated concerning <hi>Judas,</hi> according to our Common Version of that passage (<hi>Acts</hi> i. 25.) where 'tis said that <hi>Judas by transgression fell from his part in the Apostleship, that he might go to his Own place;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:56898:16"/>
as <hi>naturally</hi> as <hi>weight</hi> sinks a Stone down towards the Center.</p>
            <p>These Reflections upon Gods Omniscience are <hi>such</hi> as seem proper to make the Consideration of it Useful to us. And as for the Conduct of our particular Practice, the <hi>best</hi> of all Rules may be borrowed from Holy <hi>David's</hi> Example, <hi>Psal.</hi> xvi. 9. where he says <hi>I have set God always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me: So</hi> let us: God is always <hi>By</hi> us, let us set him always <hi>before</hi> us; His Eyes are always upon <hi>Us,</hi> let Ours be likewise proportionably upon <hi>Him:</hi> Let us keep our minds in a <hi>Lively Sense</hi> of the Venerableness of his Presence, and the Awfulness of his Inspection; And <hi>this</hi> is the best Method to guard us from treating that Inspection <hi>irreverently,</hi> and to keep us <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> of doing any thing <hi>unsuitable</hi> to such a Presence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Come see the man that told me all that ever I did,</hi> cries the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> after her Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation with our <hi>Saviour</hi> at <hi>Jacob's Well:</hi> Think a little upon <hi>that</hi> Conversation, or upon such a <hi>possible</hi> one with <hi>thy self:</hi> Think what Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, what Strugling of several Passions started up in that <hi>Womans</hi> Breast, so soon as she found <hi>One,</hi> whom she look'd upon as a pure <hi>Stranger</hi> to her, to break in upon <hi>all</hi> her <hi>Secrets:</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:56898:17"/>
The same shall <hi>one day</hi> be <hi>every ones</hi> Case; The same <hi>Jesus</hi> (though in more <hi>awful</hi> Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces) shall <hi>tell</hi> every one of us <hi>all that ever we did:</hi> And say <hi>then</hi> where lies our Wisdom but in a Constant Endeavour to do <hi>that</hi> that will <hi>bear the Telling?</hi> Happy are they that pursue this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour!

               <p>MY publishing the foregoing Sermon puts me in mind of a Debt of the same Kind to Your self, which I shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge by publishing that which follows. Why it was not publish'd when first de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, the Sermon it self will speak my Apology. I <hi>there</hi> represent Good King <hi>Jehosaphat</hi> giving <hi>such Counsel</hi> to <hi>His Judges,</hi> as was not given to the Judges of this Realm in the Year 1686. &amp;c. And although, preaching upon such an Occasion, I thought it no less than my <hi>Duty</hi> to <hi>Speak</hi> what I did; yet to Print it (which was beyond my Duty) would have been no other than an Officious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56898:19"/>
The Printing it <hi>Now</hi> gives me a Fresh Admonition to be Thankful to God for the wonderful Providence whereby we were delivered from those fearful apprehensions which possest us at that Time; and whereby we are settled in such a state of Happiness and Freedom, that any One may say what is Consonant to Law and Justice, without fear of Thwart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Measures of the Government; or hazard of being brought under Censure for it. And Your self may now <hi>Safely</hi> (which then you could not) espouse the Dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as a Testimony of my Respect, who am</p>

                  <q>Take heed what ye do, for ye judge not for men, but for the Lord.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THE Heathens themselves did never set about any Solemn Business, but they began with Religious Offices: And <hi>Hierocles</hi> (one of them) gives us account of the Notion on which this their Piety was grounded; He says, <hi>They pray'd to the Gods, before they set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Business, for Two Reasons</hi> (1.) <hi>That they might procure the Divine Assistance in what they went about,</hi> and (2.) <hi>That in Contemplation of that Assistance, they might act Soberly and in such a manner as to do nothing Unworthy of it.</hi> The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are as Enforcing, as the Example is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable; and I hope there is no Soul in this Assembly so Loose as not to be suitably affected with Both: I hope none here is so Profane as to account <hi>Going to Church the Great Importance of a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56898:20"/>
Circuit;</hi> or so Inconsiderable as to think that the Administration of Justice is a Business of such a Nature as may be done well enough without particular Regard to Gods Assistance: Let a Man but weigh the <hi>Words</hi> now read unto you, he shall find Reason in them sufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute any such Apprehension.</p>
               <p>They are the <hi>Words</hi> of King <hi>Jehosaphat,</hi> of whom the <hi>former Verse</hi> tells us, That <hi>He set Judges in the land throughout all the Cities of</hi> Judah: and in <hi>this</hi> Verse, He is brought in as giving In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and Caution to those Judges in this Form, <hi>Take heed what ye do, for ye judge not for men, but for the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Explication of which Words I shall use no other Method than the making of this <hi>Paraphrase</hi> upon them in the <hi>Person</hi> of the King: <q>Ye Men (and <hi>Now,</hi> ye Principal Men) of <hi>Judah!</hi> I have advanc'd You to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy, and made You the Guardians of Peace and Justice; It is become Your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to give Life to the Laws, to redress the Injur'd, to check the Insolent, and to bound the Unruly: Power and Honour always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend Your Persons, and Submission waits on Your Decrees: But this notwithstanding, let me advise You, Be not over-much Pleased with Your Station, but rather <hi>Take heed,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56898:20"/>
and be afraid: For Magistracy does not only advance, it likewises Indicates and Tries; Your Honour is ballanc'd with Duty, and Your Power is clog'd with Temptation; Please not Your selves therefore in thinking that I have confer'd on You the Power to do Great things, but rather <hi>Take heed what ye do:</hi> For You cannot but be tempted to do Amiss; You will find Your Integrity assaulted through Every Passion. Among those Persons over whose Causes You will Preside, some are Great, and they may possibly byass You by Your Fear; some are Bountiful, and they will not fail to bait Your Desire; some are Insinuating, and they may chance to warp You by Affection; But <hi>Take heed,</hi> and remember that <hi>Ye Judge not for Men.</hi> I my self, Your King, what a Temptation must I needs be to You? You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but reflect in all Your Transactions, that You are Mine by Original Duty, Mine by present Obligation, Mine by all Future Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectances; and what Prudence then can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der You from concluding that My Pleasure ought to be Your Supreme Rule? But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that <hi>You Judge not even for Me:</hi> For though I can communicate that Power to You, which I have received from God; yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prescribe any other Ends and Uses of that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56898:21"/>
Power, than what God himself has prescribed both to You and Me; I can give You Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Judge, but God has fix'd the Mark and Scope of Your Judgment in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable Measures of Right and Truth: Remember therefore that <hi>You Judge for the Lord;</hi> It is <hi>Gods</hi> Business that Your Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter engages You in; 'Tis His Cause You have now undertaken.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this Effect that <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Wise King</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned his Judges: and it well became <hi>Him;</hi> but I am aware that to the Manners of <hi>Other Men</hi> there must be Other Measures; and for such a One as I am, to pursue the same Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to Persons of that Conspicuous Order were too great an Indecency.</p>
               <p>I shall therefore choose to extend the Concern of the Advice to All that either <hi>do,</hi> or <hi>may</hi> any way Relate to Publick Justice.</p>
               <p>And the Words will very well bear that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension; When we consider that in the Transa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of Judicature, many may be said to Judge <hi>in Effect,</hi> besides him who pronounces the Last Sentence: For as in a Clock, though the <hi>Hand</hi> only indicates the Point of Time; yet the <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Spring,</hi> and every subordinate <hi>Wheel</hi> influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Motion to that Point which the Hand does Indicate: so in the Administration of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56898:21"/>
they that <hi>Inform</hi> and <hi>Testifie;</hi> They that <hi>Inquire</hi> and <hi>Report,</hi> they that <hi>Colour</hi> and <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent</hi> what is alledged, do all <hi>judge in Effect,</hi> i. e. They have all a necessary Influence upon the Issue; and the <hi>Sentence</hi> of the Judge is no more than the <hi>Index</hi> of a Judgment, which Remoter Agents do move and direct to.</p>
               <p>To All therefore that either <hi>do,</hi> or <hi>may Relate</hi> to Judgment; The Words offer these two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>

               </list>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>The Judgment is for the Lord:</hi> By Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I mean (suitably to the Notion of the Text) that <hi>Business</hi> which this <hi>Honourable Assembly</hi> is by and by proceeding upon; (<hi>viz.</hi>) The Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of Justice in all its Acts and Offices, whether <hi>Punitive, Coercive,</hi> or <hi>Decisive:</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which Judgment the <hi>Vulgar</hi> Opinion is, that it is indeed the <hi>Great Civil</hi> Affair, the Prime and most important Business of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; And this Opinion is <hi>True,</hi> but it is <hi>Short;</hi> For my Text alledges that this Judgment is moreover a <hi>Religious</hi> Affair, and the very <hi>Business of God: Ye Judge for the Lord:</hi> And the Truth of
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56898:22"/>
this Assertion I shall clear to you in these <hi>Four Positions;</hi> Each of them bringing in a several In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance for the Proof of it; (<hi>viz.</hi>)</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. That the <hi>Power</hi> of Judgment is Gods <hi>Right.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. That the <hi>Matter</hi> of Judgment is Gods <hi>Cause.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>III. That the <hi>Issue</hi> of Judgment is Gods <hi>End:</hi> and</item>
                  <item>IV. That the <hi>Formal</hi> Judgment, that is, The <hi>Sentence</hi> of Judgment is <hi>Gods Sentence.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>The first Position is <hi>this,</hi> that the <hi>Power</hi> of Judgment is Gods <hi>Right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>None may doubt but that every <hi>Supreme Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate</hi> is <hi>vested</hi> with a proper Judicial Power; which Power He may either Exercise <hi>Himself,</hi> or else <hi>Delegate</hi> it to any Others whom he shall think Fit for the Exercise of it: But <hi>this</hi> I as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert; That no Supreme Magistrate can pretend to the Right of this Judicial Power from any <hi>Human Title,</hi> or manner of Acquisition: It is a Prerogative <hi>above</hi> any Station or Character that <hi>One Man</hi> can advance <hi>Another</hi> unto; And Every one that <hi>has</hi> it, has it <hi>derived</hi> to him <hi>from God,</hi> in as real a Sense, as <hi>he</hi> can be said to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive</hi> it <hi>to</hi> any Inferiour and Deputed Minister or Judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:56898:22"/>Our Saviour has told us what we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in this Matter, from his <hi>Own</hi> Case: Who upon the Insinuation of <hi>Pilat,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Judge, that He was <hi>One who had Power either to Condemn, or to Release him,</hi> makes this Reply; <hi>I know thou couldst have no power over me, unless it were given thee from above:</hi>

                  </gap>, (not from <hi>Rome,</hi> but) <hi>from Heaven;</hi> from <hi>Cesar</hi> indeed <hi>Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately,</hi> but <hi>Fontally</hi> and Originally from <hi>God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And so <hi>Sacred</hi> a thing is the <hi>Exercise</hi> of this Power, that not only <hi>Princes themselves,</hi> but even their <hi>Deputed Ministers</hi> of Justice are <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> honoured in the <hi>Scripture</hi> with the <hi>Style of Gods;</hi> as sustaining Gods <hi>Person</hi> in Judgment, and acting in <hi>His Right.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Evidence that the Holy <hi>Scripture</hi> brings in to this Assertion is Abundant: And He whose Curiosity seeks for Conviction of <hi>another kind,</hi> let him Consider <hi>this Instance: (viz.)</hi> The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate <hi>Bears the Sword</hi> (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> expresses it) which is the Ensign of the Judicial Power, and imports a <hi>Jurisdiction extending over Life; and he Bears it not in vain</hi> (says the same Apostle) that is, He has Right to use it: But <hi>now,</hi> let any one Consider by what possible <hi>Human Right</hi> the Magistrate can acquire a Jurisdiction that <hi>extends Over Life:</hi> For no Man has this Right
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56898:23"/>
in <hi>Himself;</hi> no Man has Power over his <hi>Own</hi> Life; and <hi>How</hi> then can any <hi>confer</hi> it on A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother?</p>
               <p>I know any Man may forfeit his Life by his Crimes; but when he has so done, no Other <hi>Man</hi> can <hi>take that Forfeiture, without Gods Claim:</hi> And therefore after a Man has <hi>deserved</hi> to Die never so Justly, it is not Lawful for him to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute that Judgment upon <hi>himself;</hi> Nor yet can he, by his <hi>Own Act,</hi> render it Lawful for any <hi>Other</hi> to execute It upon him; And therefore the Magistrate, which <hi>bears the Sword</hi> for that purpose, and has the <hi>Only</hi> Right of Executing this Judgment, is for <hi>that very</hi> Reason call'd by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the same place, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of God,</hi> as Invested with <hi>Gods</hi> Authority, and acting in <hi>His</hi> Right; who as he is the only <hi>Author,</hi> so (<hi>therefore</hi>) He is the <hi>only Lord of Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. The <hi>Matter</hi> of Judgment is Gods <hi>Cause;</hi> I call the Matter of Judgment such <hi>Matters</hi> and <hi>Cases</hi> as properly fall under <hi>Judicial Cognisance:</hi> And they (for the greatest part) are <hi>such</hi> as are <hi>Intrinsically Moral,</hi> involving Good or Evil in their Own Nature: <hi>such</hi> as are all the <hi>Concerns</hi> of Truth, Right, Equity, Mercy; and all the Contrary Violations that proceed from Maiice,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56898:23"/>
Falshood or Unfaithfulness. Now <hi>All these</hi> are properly <hi>Gods Cause;</hi> For they were the Matters of <hi>His Law</hi> before they were of <hi>Man's;</hi> and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Laws in Respect of those are only the Transcripts of that which is Divine and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: And that is the Reason why the Just Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of all such Cases (which is the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of True and Righteous Judgment) is said in the Holy Scripture to be the Direct and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Service of God,</hi> and is required of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates under that Notion. And this is the Reason why the Heathens, though they knew not the True God, were yet interpreted to honour and serve the True God by the Offices of Justice and Judgment: For so the <hi>Fathers</hi> doubt not to assert that God prospered even Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Nations for <hi>this Reason;</hi> and particularly that the <hi>Romans</hi> extended their Empire to that height of glory by Gods blessing upon their <hi>Eminent Justice.</hi> For as the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Book of Wisdom</hi> argues (on the other hand) concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Perjury in those Idolaters; that <hi>when they swore falsly,</hi> though it were <hi>by False Gods,</hi> yet they were <hi>punished by the True,</hi> because the <hi>sin was against Him:</hi> (Meaning that every Deviation from the <hi>Natural Law,</hi> or the Dictates of our Consciences, is a sin against <hi>that God that planted
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56898:24"/>
these Dictates</hi> in us, in order to this that they should be our Law:) So likewise (on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary) so long as those Idolaters did observe these Natural Dictates, and assert and maintain them in their Publick Judgments, they <hi>pleased and served the True God</hi> (though to them Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known) and were accordingly prospered and blessed by him for it.</p>
               <p>It is no Doubt but that in Cases where the Matter under Determination appertains to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Right,</hi> the Cause is <hi>Gods,</hi> and an <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Determination</hi> of them is His Proper Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: But we must allow that there are many Cases of Judicial Cognisance, whose Matters are <hi>not</hi> of Natural, but only of <hi>Positive</hi> Right; which happens as often as Laws are enacted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout things that are in their Own Nature <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.</hi> Now it is certain, these Matters do not Directly belong to Gods Cause; and yet they do <hi>Consequentially;</hi> Because Indifferent things do generally carry in them the Advantages and Encouragements of Necessary Things; And, whether they do or no, God will have our <hi>Obedience</hi> approved in <hi>Indifferent</hi> Things as well as <hi>Necessary.</hi> We conclude therefore that <hi>Moral</hi> Things (which are most commonly the Matter of Human Laws) are Gods Cause
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56898:24"/>
by <hi>Antecedent Relation;</hi> and that <hi>Indifferent</hi> things when they once are <hi>made</hi> Matter of Human Laws, do then become Gods Cause by Espousal: And therefore it is that <hi>Both</hi> are charged <hi>upon the Consciences</hi> of Men by the <hi>Apostle;</hi> and Both are to be observed for the sake of <hi>God;</hi> Or in Case they are <hi>not</hi> observed, the Animadversion upon those that do not observe them, is no less than a Judgment executed in <hi>Gods Behalf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. The <hi>Issue</hi> of Judgment is Gods <hi>End.</hi> The <hi>Political End</hi> of Judgment is the Maintenance of the <hi>Laws,</hi> the securing of <hi>Rights,</hi> the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of <hi>Industry,</hi> and the establishing of <hi>Peace;</hi> in <hi>which</hi> consists that <hi>Political Happiness</hi> that Every Government aims at: But God has a <hi>Greater End</hi> in it than <hi>All this,</hi> and that is the <hi>making of Men Internally Good and Virtuous,</hi> and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them the <hi>Foundation</hi> of a <hi>Future Happiness,</hi> a Happiness that will last when all the Polities of the World are past off the Stage and expired.</p>
               <p>So that we ought to look upon <hi>Judgment as a Part of Gods Providence,</hi> whereby he governs the World to his most holy Purposes. For as we all acknowledge that God has a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence whereby he <hi>does</hi> govern the World; so if we enquire into the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of that Providence, we shall find it to be no other than a <hi>series of several Methods to make Men Good;</hi> to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56898:25"/>
which End this of Human Judgment is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing in the most Eminent manner. For no doubt but <hi>Judgment</hi> is the <hi>greatest possible Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal</hi> Bond of Human Virtue; and the <hi>most effectual</hi> Check of disorderly Passions: It guards Men from doing Ill by a Wholsome Fear; and those that have done Ill, it brings to <hi>Repentance</hi> by Suffering: Insomuch that in the Scripture it is recommended as the great <hi>Disposition to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi> and the great <hi>Preparatory to the salvation of God:</hi> For the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> speaking of the <hi>Coming</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> and <hi>explaining</hi> as it were that <hi>future Message</hi> of <hi>John the Baptist; Prepare ye the way of the Lord,</hi> he does it in these Words, <hi>Isaiah</hi> lvi. 1. <hi>thus saith the Lord, keep ye judgment and do justice, for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be revealed.</hi> And to the same sense is that Passage <hi>Psalm</hi> xcvii. where after it has been said (verse 1.) <hi>The Lord reigneth, the earth may be glad thereof;</hi> it follows (verse 2.) <hi>justice and judgment are the establishment of his throne;</hi> As if, according to the Ordinary nature of Things, God could not <hi>Reign,</hi> where the <hi>Government did not assert him:</hi> He may in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion <hi>hover</hi> over a People; but he can never <hi>pitch his Tent and Dwell</hi> amongst them, unless the <hi>Magistrate fix him a Throne,</hi> by looking to that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56898:25"/>
                  <hi>Point,</hi> which S. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore calls the <hi>very End of Magistracy,</hi> viz. <hi>To be a terrour to evil doers and a Praise to them that do well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thus</hi> God has put into the hands of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate not only a <hi>Godlike Power,</hi> but likewise <hi>the Power of a Godlike Retaliation;</hi> For as <hi>He</hi> makes <hi>them</hi> Govern; so they may (and who questions but that they ought to) <hi>make Him Govern Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I know indeed that God has had a <hi>Church</hi> in the World (and <hi>that</hi> the most glorious Church that ever was in the World) without the <hi>Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Magistrates:</hi> But that was in an Age of Visible Miracles, and at a time when the <hi>World</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> stood <hi>notoriously distinguish'd;</hi> and while those that were of the Church were kept so <hi>Humble by Persecution,</hi> and <hi>Mortify'd by Poverty,</hi> and <hi>Sober by the Daily Expectation of Death,</hi> that they needed no Other Laws to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain their Appetites: But <hi>now</hi> that the <hi>World it self</hi> is come <hi>into</hi> the Church, and Men can maintain their Temporal Hopes and Passions, and their Christian Profession together, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible but that the <hi>Tares</hi> of Common Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption should <hi>choak</hi> and wast the <hi>Good seed,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less the <hi>Magistrate step</hi> in to <hi>weed</hi> and to pluck up, and assist in the Cultivation of the Field.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:56898:26"/>IV. The <hi>Formal</hi> Judgment, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Judgment, is Gods <hi>Sentence.</hi> For says the Psalmist, <hi>God is judge himself, Psal.</hi> 1. 6. And though Delegated Powers act <hi>for him</hi> at present, and pass the Sentence; yet he Recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizes and Imputes that Sentence, and <hi>takes it into his Own Account.</hi> We are aware that God <hi>has appointed a Day in the which he will Judge the World in Righteousness;</hi> And the Rule of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in that Day (as the Holy Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouches) shall be <hi>this,</hi> viz. <hi>Men shall Reap as they Sow; and He that hath done Wrong, shall receive for the Wrong that he hath done:</hi> Now the very <hi>same</hi> being the Rule of all Human Judicature, we ought to look upon every <hi>Judicial Sessions here</hi> to be no other than a <hi>Particular Dispatch</hi> of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, <hi>subordinate</hi> and preparatory to the <hi>Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Judgment.</hi> Thus when <hi>wrong</hi> is Recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by Human Judgment, the Judgment of God is <hi>so far</hi> Prevented. If indeed the <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence</hi> it self happen to be <hi>Wrong and Injurious,</hi> then (in the Psalmist's Style) <hi>The poor committeth himself to God, that he may take the matter into his own hands:</hi> Thus, I say, it happens should the Sentence of Judgment be in it self Wrong and Injurious; But both the Law, and Good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners look upon this as the Supposition of an
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56898:26"/>
                  <hi>Impossible</hi> thing (<hi>Turpe est Impossibile,</hi> says the <hi>Rule</hi> of Law) and therefore without farther supposing it, I shall form <hi>This Conclusion, viz.</hi> That Every <hi>Sentence of Human</hi> Judgment is <hi>Ingredient to the Retribution of the Great</hi> Day; and that All that Men suffer <hi>here</hi> for their Crimes (if they suffer it with a just <hi>sense</hi> of their Crimes) shall <hi>then</hi> be imputed to such a Measure of their Purgation; and All the <hi>Impunity</hi> that Guilt meets with <hi>here,</hi> shall be reckon'd for in the Sentence that shall <hi>then</hi> be passed. I say not, that a Man may <hi>work out</hi> his Future Absolution by any satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that he can make here to Publick Justice; or that he <hi>cannot</hi> be Absolved in the Future <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> such satisfactions here paid: Blessed be the Love of Christ, whose Satisfactions are All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient! But this I say, that since God has made True Repentance a necessary Condition, without which none can lay hold on that Satisfaction which Christ has made; and no Repentance is True that does not engage a Man to make what Satisfaction he is able <hi>himself,</hi> both to <hi>Men</hi> by Compensation for Injuries, and to <hi>God</hi> by Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for Guilt; And since Men <hi>left to their Own</hi> Discretion, are usually so Indulgent to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as not to reach the Measures of <hi>such</hi> a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, but to take up with that which is
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56898:27"/>
slight and deceiving; upon <hi>this</hi> Consideration I say, <hi>Kind and Friendly is the Force of Publick Justice</hi> that does oftentimes terrifie and compel Men to Repent: Happy is the <hi>Necessity</hi> that procureth <hi>Vertue;</hi> But especially, Adorable is the <hi>Mercy</hi> that will <hi>accept</hi> of that Vertue which Necessity doth procure!</p>
               <p>Thus I apprehend my self to have sufficiently cleared my first Proposition: And now the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of my Business is to shew, that this <hi>Consideration</hi> is of Great Importance to make Men act as they ought to do in every Relation they bear to Publick Justice. And this I shall do Distinctly according to the Method of my former Positions, shewing what Arguments for Integrity do Naturally arise from the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Each of them.</p>
               <p n="1">I. The Doctrine of the First Position was <hi>this;</hi> That the Magistrate in Judgment Sustains the <hi>Person of God,</hi> and acts for Him. Now this Consideration is of a Reasonable <hi>Force</hi> to keep the Magistrate Just and Upright in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations; and no other <hi>but</hi> this.</p>
               <p>For let the Magistrate suppose himself to <hi>sustain any other</hi> Person, or to act <hi>by</hi> or <hi>for</hi> any <hi>other</hi> whatsoever, but only God, he shall find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self immediately faln under the power of such
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56898:27"/>
Reasons as will <hi>pervert</hi> him from being Just; <hi>because</hi> there is no Person in the World, but God alone, whose Ends may not <hi>sometimes</hi> be better served by <hi>Injustice: Gods Ends</hi> are always served by Justice, and no bodies <hi>always so,</hi> but His.</p>
               <p>And hence Springs the Great Difficulty of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Just, and the necessity of that <hi>Caution,</hi> which we find so frequently inculcated to Magistrates in the Holy Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> That they should be <hi>Strong, Couragious, very Couragious:</hi> Because it is but Needful that <hi>He</hi> whose Duty will not permit him to <hi>Oblige</hi> in what is <hi>Unjust,</hi> should arm himself against the <hi>possible</hi> Malevolence of Many, who will account themselves <hi>Disoblig'd</hi> by the Direct Issues of <hi>Justice.</hi> He therefore that will be Just, must <hi>harden</hi> himself against all the Impressions of <hi>Interest;</hi> tho in <hi>that</hi> he may seem <hi>Imprudent;</hi> against all the Impressions of <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> though in <hi>that</hi> he may seem <hi>Ill-natured;</hi> against all the Impressions of <hi>Benefits,</hi> though in <hi>that</hi> he may seem <hi>Ingrateful;</hi> nay, against all the Impressions of <hi>Vulgar Pity,</hi> though in <hi>that</hi> he seem <hi>Hardhearted:</hi> He must render himself <hi>disengaged</hi> from all the World, and from <hi>Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self above</hi> all; Because <hi>Self</hi> is undoubtedly the greatest Byass to Human Prevarication.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:56898:28"/>But these (in the mean time) are <hi>Difficulties,</hi> which I think no <hi>other</hi> Consideration can enable a Man to surmount, but only the <hi>Respect of God,</hi> and the <hi>Conscience</hi> of doing that service which God himself doth both Require and Reward.</p>
               <p>I know indeed that <hi>to be Just</hi> is in <hi>it self</hi> a very <hi>glorious</hi> thing, without any farther <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Prospect: And therefore there are some <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> (naturally <hi>Generous</hi>) which though it shall happen that they have not much of <hi>Religion,</hi> will yet <hi>despise</hi> all the Temptations of <hi>Interest,</hi> and be Just <hi>for the very Glory of being so:</hi> But <hi>then</hi> we must observe that <hi>Glory</hi> it self is <hi>another</hi> Byass, and can draw Men from their Integrity, as well as any other Passion; And so it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens that a Man, that could not have been bribed with <hi>Gold,</hi> will yet be bribed with <hi>Air,</hi> that is, the <hi>Affectation of a Popular Fame.</hi> An Instance of this kind is intended in that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, <hi>Ex.</hi> xxiii. 3. where 'tis said, <hi>Thou shalt not countenance a poor man in his cause:</hi> Intimating, that when a Poor Man has a Bad Cause, though there can be no <hi>Other</hi> Temptation, yet there may be that of <hi>Vain-glory,</hi> to be Unjust: Because a Sentence given in behalf of a Poor Man is <hi>so Popular</hi> and <hi>Specious,</hi> that though it
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56898:28"/>
should be <hi>Unjust,</hi> yet it may gain a Man the <hi>Reputation</hi> of a more Impartial Justice. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed when a Man comes to <hi>affect Glory</hi> from any thing, though from <hi>Vertue</hi> it self, he is faln into the <hi>Temptation</hi> of preferring the Glory <hi>above</hi> the Vertue; and <hi>so</hi> of <hi>Leaving</hi> the Vertue for the Glory's sake, if at any time they shall happen to be Divided. So Important a Reason there is for that Precept of the Apostle, <hi>Let him that glorieth, glory in the Lord:</hi> To which let me subjoin; <hi>Let him that will be just, be just for the Lord; Because</hi> it is impossible for any one to be accurately <hi>Just for any other Prospect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. The second <hi>Position</hi> was <hi>this,</hi> That the <hi>Matter</hi> of Judgment is <hi>Gods Cause:</hi> And <hi>this</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration is very forcible to engage all <hi>Others</hi> to bring in their <hi>Respective</hi> due Assistances to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Justice.</p>
               <p>'Tis a Notion to be met with more than once among the <hi>Heathen Moralists,</hi> that <hi>A Good Man is a Perpetual Magistrate;</hi> and that, though he be not <hi>made</hi> so by the <hi>Governing Power,</hi> he is made so by <hi>Nature;</hi> that is, A Good Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be a Friend and Patron to the <hi>Laws;</hi> His Love to Vertue and the Publick Good will not suffer him to be <hi>Unconcern'd,</hi> when he sees <hi>them</hi> broken and contemned. And if it be so with a
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56898:29"/>
                  <hi>Good Man;</hi> I am sure it cannot be otherwise with a <hi>Good Christian:</hi> It is impossible that <hi>such</hi> a one should see and <hi>bear with Indifference,</hi> that the Concerns of Truth, the Offices of Morality and Religion (which I say are the general Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Law) those Duties wherein <hi>Gods Honour,</hi> and the <hi>Common Welfare,</hi> nay the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salvation</hi> are so nearly concerned, should be broken and neglected without a proper Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.</p>
               <p>We all conclude that <hi>He</hi> wants Compassion, and sins against the Law of <hi>Humanity,</hi> who will suffer the Poor to perish for want of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving; But if the Perishing of <hi>Souls</hi> be of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Moment than the Perishing of <hi>Bodies,</hi> I am sure he has <hi>less Compassion,</hi> and sins more against the Law of Humanity, who will suffer <hi>Good Manners</hi> to be <hi>run down</hi> for want of Asserting, I do not say that every Good Christian should rise up like <hi>Phineas,</hi> and execute the <hi>Judgment of Zeal</hi> (as the Rabbins call it;) but this I say, that every Good Christian ought to have a constant Regard to the <hi>Ends</hi> of Publick Justice, which are the <hi>Restraint of Vice,</hi> and the <hi>Maintenance of Good Manners;</hi> and to these Ends he ought never to be <hi>wanting</hi> in any sort of <hi>Prudential</hi> As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:56898:29"/>And in this Point I humbly wish that the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> would be pleased to hear me as <hi>their</hi> Particular Remembrancer. Whether they are Magistrates or no, let them always bear in mind, that an <hi>Awful Example</hi> carries Magistracy in <hi>it self;</hi> and he that lives <hi>Christianly</hi> is the <hi>Best</hi> Justiciary; <hi>he</hi> gives the Best Assistance to Publick Justice, and cures most Crimes among the People.</p>
               <p>God has given <hi>this</hi> Precept among other Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Laws, <hi>Lev.</hi> xix. as <hi>that</hi> which has a most direct Influence upon the Affairs of Publick Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, <hi>viz. Thou shalt in any wise rebuke thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and not suffer sin upon him.</hi> The Charge is given to All, but it obliges the Gentleman <hi>most,</hi> whose Fortunes give him the Advantage of Executing it with the happiest success: For in Matters of Duty, Our <hi>Power</hi> is always the <hi>Measure</hi> of our Obligation.</p>
               <p>It is an Ill Crisis, when Mens Religion comes to be so <hi>Modest,</hi> that they will not <hi>Rebuke</hi> sin, or keep Vertue in Countenance, for fear of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading the <hi>Preachers Office;</hi> as if it were pure Officiousness in Others, and exceeding the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of <hi>their</hi> Obligation.

Father of All, came to distinguish <hi>You</hi> from the Crowd of Indigents, and to prefer You to such an <hi>Unequal</hi> Distribution. Can you say it is for Services <hi>already</hi> done?

               </p>
               <p>It would trouble me to doubt of any of your Zeal for that Religion, which You and the Laws profess: Look where you will, you will never find any Constituted of a more <hi>saving Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> than <hi>that</hi> is: But be pleased to bear in mind, That to <hi>appear</hi> for Religion, and <hi>not</hi> to appear against <hi>Vice,</hi> is in effect a Contradiction; and he that will not assert his Religion better than <hi>so,</hi> is in the <hi>nearest</hi> hazard of losing it.</p>

But much more Inexcusable is the Evil, whose <hi>Product</hi> is likewise evil; this is a Double Sin: And so is every Iniquity interposed in the Administration of Justice; It is a <hi>solemn</hi> Evil in the <hi>Act,</hi> and yet a <hi>Worse</hi> in the <hi>Effect</hi> it produces. <hi>Ex.
