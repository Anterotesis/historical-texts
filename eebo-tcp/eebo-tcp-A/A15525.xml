            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

According to the Greeke Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, <hi>

                  </gap>, Our latter thoughts bee wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser then our first,</hi> I went ouer it againe by Catechizing Questions and Answeres in my Charge, when I had once finished it by Lectures or Sermons. All this while, I had not a peece of a purpose to publish it (being resolued it shold serue as <hi>Seede,</hi> for that portion of the Lordes fielde, and Husbandry committed to my care and trust,) partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause diuers learned <hi>Commentaries</hi> of Moderne Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, both forreigne and domesticall, and some of them in our <hi>Mother-tongue</hi> were already extant vpon this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, but especia'ly, for that Iiudged my selfe farre vnsuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for such an enterprise.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:20835:3"/>As there was small reason after such burning lampes, to erect my obscure light, so I saw great reason to esteem my worke very vnworthy the publike view of this lette<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and iudicious Age. Yea, though sundry of my fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helpers in the Lord (who by occasion of their businesse in our Citty, were partakers of part of these Labours) both by word and writing, out of other Diocesses, solicited me both earnestly and often: For all this, I suffered it to lye by mee, rudely drawne out in Papers, for mine owne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate vse. At last (being much mooued thereunto by three seuerall Letters, I was willing to part from my Coppie, with expresse charge to him who receyued it, (a Friend in <hi>London)</hi> vpon good Reasons rendred, that it should onely bee surueyed by some skilfull Ministers, to haue their opinion and aduice about the fitnesse of the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cre it came vnto the authorized Licenser: for two eyes see more then one. And in matters of this kinde (it is wel knowne to some) I haue not trusted my selfe: Euerie man in his ownc cause is party, and therefore partial. Loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers on, often see more then the Actors doe. But being preuented, it was put into the Examiners hand, before I had set too my last hand. Afterward, it was by my friend, sent downe to me to be polished and perfected. Perceiuing how heauens prouidence had brought it thus vppon the stage, that it might both see and giue light, what was I that I should resist it? Where it may be marked, that where God leadeth the way, there it is safe following and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming after. I yeelded the more willingly, considering the motion and opinion of many Iudicious friends (touching the fruitfulnesse of it) did cal it out; also, for that my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weake endeuours in this kinde, namely my Dictiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Scriptures, found gracious acceptation &amp; enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
<pb facs="tcp:20835:3"/>
of this present worke I haue the more reason to hope well, not onely because of the excellency and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of the matters handled, and namely, in the manie and maine differences betweene the ancient faith of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> to whom <hi>Paul</hi> wrote, and the newe vpstart opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our seduced <hi>Romanists,</hi> against whom wee preach and write: but also for the vnusuall and not vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble manner of teaching by <hi>Interpretations, Doctrines, Reasons,</hi> and <hi>Vses:</hi> a forme wherein neuer any Comment on this Epistle was set foorth before. As <hi>Iacob</hi> when his Sonnes were to trauaile into <hi>Egypt</hi> for Corne, prayed for them, saying, <hi>The God almighty giue you mercie before the man;</hi> so to this Treatise being to trauaile into many places, I wish that it may finde fauour in their eyes that shall reade it. To which purpose (gentle Reader who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer thou be) suffer me to aduertise thee of some fevv things, whereof I thinke it requisite thou shouldst take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, somwhat to excuse such faults, as in such a worlde of matter I could not but run into, beeing a man, and more subiect to erre, then inumerable other men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. First, thou hast here but an Epitome &amp; abridgement of longer discourses; for the points of doctrine were large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed &amp; furnished in my Sermons, which in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogue are contracted. Wherein if you meet with some tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tologies and super fluities, or with dislocations, som things not set in the right place, or claudications and defects; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it I pray thee to the multitude of businesses, being 3. times at least euery weeke in the publike vse of my Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, whilst I did peruse &amp; prepare this to the Presse.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Whereas some Doctrines are but lightly touched &amp; left bare without any amplification, it is eyther because they were more obvious and casie; or else are enlarged
<pb facs="tcp:20835:4"/>
in some part of the Booke, or because the volume would haue swolne too much, if I had dilated all alike. Looke for these tearmes, <hi>Coherence, Scope, Sum, Parts, Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, Doctrines, &amp;c.</hi> but sometime pointed in the Margent, yet mostly noted in the body of the Booke, as will be of any heedfull Reader, easily obserued.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Howsoeuer this whole Booke seeme, and indeede is bigger then at first was thought of, (the Epistle beeing exceeding rich in Doctrines, whereof thou hast scarse the gleanings,) yet the particular Dialogues, will be deemed rather too compendious; Matters being rather pointed at with the finger, then explicated to the ful; not so much the truth spoken out, as an hint giuen what might be spoken, leauing good grounds of Meditation, to such as haue the gift and Art of Meditating.</p>
            <p n="4">4. These things were preached in a popular Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (for the most part,) where care was had to vtter high things, in homely plaine words; therefore the learned are to beare with it, if they alwayes finde not the sublimity of the stile, to answere the Maiesty of the matter. I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther speake fiue words to edification, then a thousand to vaine ostentation. And because I did not enioy the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of body in equall tenour, during the handling of this Epistle, the Reader therefore may not looke for equal exactnesse of stile and stuffe, in euery part of this Booke.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I had a care to accommodate my selfe, as for man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, so for matter to my Auditory, &amp; in that regard haue pressed some points further then some other, and passed by or lightly passed ouer more pertinent to the text, to driue home some others more fitting to the times and persons, where and with whom I do liue. Howbeit this thou shalt finde vniuer sally thorow the whole Booke, that both the
<pb facs="tcp:20835:4"/>
naturall sence of words and phrases, and the Analysis or artificiall disposition of the Text, with <hi>Summe, Scope,</hi> and <hi>Coherence</hi> of euery Sentence, is constantly and faithfully (I trust) deliuered. But for as much as there was an Ocean of hard and dark some, both things to be entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and Texts to be interpreted, wherein I mette with great diuersity of Opinions among Expositors, so as it was difficult (if not imposible) for such an one as I am, to hit the marke in euery passage of this Epistle; therefore in my best humblenesse and reuerence, I submit my Spirit vnto the Prophets, being not onely desirous, but beseeching the Learned Teachers and guides of our English, Church in loue to shew me my faylings, whereof I feare they shal find not a few, not slight ones.

                     <p>A Difference and dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betweene the Iewes &amp; Gentiles, which was abused by the malice of Satan, and was likely to haue much hindered the course of the Gospell, yea, to haue stifled and choakt it in the verie Cradle and beginnings. For, the Iewes which did beleeue, did thinke thorough the suggestion of some false Apostles, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. that the Legall Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were to be still obserued, as necessary to Salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that vnlesse men were circumcised, and kept the Law, they could not be iustified and saued by Christ.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:20835:6"/>
Whereas the beleeuing Gentiles did knowe by the Doctrine of the Gospell, their exemption from <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> Law, being taught, that in the death and passion of our Lord, all Legall rites were fully determined; and that Faith alone in Christ, was sufficient to Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication before God. Heereuppon, arose no small discorde betweene Iewes and Gentiles, which were mixed together; the Iewes bearing themselues inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently because of their priuiledges, despised the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles as enemies of <hi>Moyses</hi> Law; and the Gentiles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting ouer the Iewes, as reiected of God, for the contempt of Christ. To compound this dissention, <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle framed this Epistle; First, shewing that neyther Gentiles by their naturall Woorkes, or Iewes by their Legall deeds, could be Iustified: for somuch as the one violated and brake the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and the other, the Lawe of <hi>Moyses:</hi> therefore, both the one and the other, were to be Iustified tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Christ alone, apprehended by a true and liuely Faith. After this generall Doctrine, reaching vnto the ninth Chapter, there he doth in more perticular sort, represse both the insolency of the Iews, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, that the promises were giuen, and became effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall onely to the true <hi>Israel,</hi> euen to such as were of the faith of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to all the Elect of God which beleeue in Christ, and not to the carnall seede which came of <hi>Abraham,</hi> onely according to the flesh. Then in the 11. Chapter, conuerting him to the Gentiles, he perswadeth them vnto humility, that they should modestly behaue themselues toward the Iewes, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as diuers of them were dayly called to the Faith, and towardes the second comming of Christ, God would graffe in againe the whole Nation, and make them the Members of the Christian Church. When the fulnesse (or bodie) of the Gentiles should enter into the same, then the blindnesse of the Iewes should cease, it being neyther totall nor final, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20835:6"/>
in part, and for a time. In the 14. Chapter againe, <hi>Paul</hi> setteth vppon Iewes and Gentiles, exhorting them both, with many and waighty reasons, vnto Brotherly loue and peace, not to be diuided one from another, or to iudge and contemne one another, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Dayes and Meats, and such things as were of a middle nature. The rest of the Epistle, is spent in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations to Morrall Good-workes, both speciall in respect of a Calling, and generall belonging to all Christians, Chap. 12. and part of the 13. where poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall duties be vrged, both of the Maiestrate, and of the Subiect. Finally, after diuers salutations, and familiar matters, he doth verie grauely conclude the Epistle, with admonition to take heede of false Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, with giuing of Thankes and praises of God.</p>

touching the Gentiles, he doth demo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stratiuely proue from verse 18. to the end of the Chapter: the reason is, because being transgressors by manisold and gric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous sinnes, both against God, thorow impiety, and men thorow vnrighteousnesse, monstrous and vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, they were worthy of aeternall damnation, so farre off was it, that their woorkes could Iustify and giue them life eternall.

                        <p>Not by his owne merits, either foreseene or present, as <hi>Origen</hi> thought, but by the eternal decree of God, who set him apart for that seruice of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Paul was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate. 1. to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life. 2. to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of both to beleeue as a Christian. 3. to preach it as an A ostle.</note> the Doctrine of saluation, as it is heere saide put apart to <hi>Preach,</hi> to wit; to the Gentiles, Acts 23. which was both from the instant of his birth, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2, 15. &amp; at the time of his calling to the Apostleship, and from euerlasting, by an eternall election, as <hi>Chrysostom</hi> and after Peter <hi>Martyr</hi> affirmeth.

Secondly, by the Efficient cause, It is reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from Heauen of God himselfe, and teacheth the Grace of God; therefore called the Gospell of God.

                        <p>There be heercof sundrie Arguments, which may perswade all men, and some which will, and doe perswade Gods Children. First (that which was tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched before) the great Hermony and constant consent of one part of this Booke with another, in such a huge variety of infinite matter, yet no repugnancy; howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer some diuersity may be found. Secondly, the Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty of the matter in great simplicity of words. Thirdlie, the efficacy, power, and vertue thereof, working in the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20835:11"/>
hearts of sinners for their conuersion, which no other Writing in the world, doth or can effect: for mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in their reasons and wils being corrupt, are as contrary to the Doctrine taught in these Bookes, as darknesse to light; Heauen to Hell; yet are they by the mighty efficacy hid in them, reconciled to them; so as they willingly yeeld, approoue, and honor them: also the power of them maketh euen the wicked to feare and tremble, as in <hi>Foelix.</hi> Fourthlie, the euents<note place="margin">Foelix.</note> of Prophesies so many hundred, yea, so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares fore-shewed. (As the Seede of the Woman promised to <hi>Adam,</hi> the bondage of <hi>Iacob</hi> in <hi>AEgypt,</hi> the Captiuity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the Birth of <hi>Iosiah</hi> and of <hi>Cirus;</hi> reuealing of Antichrist; and innumerable such like) and made before, yet accordingly fulfilled in their due time, doth bewray them to be from that all seeing veritie. Fiftly, the Penmen of the Scripture (as <hi>Moyses, Dauid, Iob, Mathew, Paul)</hi> discouering their owne cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and infirmities, euen to their owne great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice, and crack of their own estimation in the world, and so vnpartially reporting the foul blemishes of their owne people and Country-men, doth testifie that they were gouerned by the holy Spirit of truth, in the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them. Sixtlie, there be sundry examples and sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in the Bible, to which euen the Heathen and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan; yea, and Iewish Writers (being enemies to Christ) doe giue testimony to the truth of them; as in <hi>Iosephus</hi> and others: and the witnesse of an enemy, it is of no smal credit and force. Seuenthlie, the strange preseruations of these Bookes, notwithstanding the strange malice of the Deuill, and the mischieuous pollicies and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of his most wicked Instruments to suppresse and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingnish them, yet that they should be so kept, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine intire without losse of any Booke, nay, of any Iot or Tittle (as very Iudiciously learned men do think) this diuine protection doth argue, that their Authoritie is diuine. Adde vnto all this, the constant Testimony
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20835:12"/>
which so many worthy Martirs by their death &amp; blood haue giuen to this truth. Lastly, euery one of Gods Children haue the witnesse of his owne Spirit, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of the Scriptures to testifie in the consciences of them, that they are inspired of God, and doe containe a diuine infallible truth.</p>

                        <p>That our Sauiour hath his denomination some times according to one Nature; as here he is called the Sonne of God.

to passe, that that which is proper to the one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is attributed to Christ, denominated or named af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the other; as heere the Sonne of God is said to bee made of the Seede of <hi>Dauid,</hi> which is a propertie of his humaine Nature, and yet affirmed of his Diuine, for this Vnion sake, because the person is one. See the like <hi>Acts</hi> 20, 28. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2, 8. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4, 10. in all which, that which is peculiar to the Manhood, is affirmed of Christ as God, by reason the persou is one.</p>

                        <p>But these Natures which are so straightly linked in one person, they are not confounded, but remaine diuerse in themselues, their properties and actions?</p>

                        <p>It is true, they doe so. The Manhood is not the Godhead, though the Man Christ be also God: nor the Godhead is not the Manhood, though the Son of God be also very Man; neither is the God-head Mortall, fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, nor did it hunger, was weary, or suffer, or dye, or rise againe, or ascend, or pray; nor the Manhood is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, Incomprehensible, Inuisible, present in euerie place, &amp;c. but the Natures with their properties and workes, remaine still distinct one from the otherꝭ how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer they be conioyned most neerely in the person of our Redeemer.

Thirdly, by grace of Personall vnion, thus the Man Christ is the Sonne of God, being knit to the person of the Sonne. <hi>Luke 1. That holy thing which is borne of thee, shall be called the Sonne of God.</hi> Fourthlie, by Generation: thus the second person in the Trinitie, is the Eternall Sonne of God, by Eternall and vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueable Generation, being begotten from all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the substance of his Father: heereof called his onely begotten Sonne. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 13. and that Sonne of the Euerlasting God. <hi>Math.</hi> 16, 16. by an excellency, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he alone is in a peculiar manner, God with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Coeternall, Coequall in the substance and glory of the God-head, before all Worlds; and the Head of our Adoption and sonship: this dignity being giuen to the faithfull to bee Sonne of God, by beleeuing in the Name of this Son. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1, 12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3, 26.</p>

Thirdly, that hee might giue his spirit to the elect to sanctifie them, for the spirit being God, none but God could giue him. Fourthly, that he might raise vp himselfe from the dead, and all his members with him, at the last and great day. Fiftly, that hee might bee a maintainer of that saluation which hee

                     <p>Thus much; not to be louers of God actiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but passiuely; to be right deare to God, of great account &amp; price in his sight, euen as it were his chiefe delight, being loued both by praedestination, and by present Iustification, without any merit.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>The great worthinesse and dignity of a true Christian, that the great God sets his loue vpon him to take pleasure in him; which is more, then if all the Princes of the Earth should ioyne and conspire toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to loue one man. Secondly, that they be happie Men which be Gods Children, for they haue God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and fauourable, in whose fauour is life, and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whose loue depends all felicity, both earthly and heauenly; they cannot be miserable whom God lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth; and they cannot but be miserable whom God hateth. Thirdly, that the loue and free good will of God, is the root of all other benefits: namely, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Sanctification, and Remission of sinnes are deriued from hence, that God louing vs, wee loued not him, but he loued vs first. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4, 10. Also, God so loued the World, that he gaue his Son. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3, 16. Fourthly, this should prouoke his Children to returne dilection and loue to God, of whom they are beloued. Fiftly, godly persons ought to be very deare vnto vs, and of great reckoning, sithence God our Father loues them. We should loue where he loues,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:20835:18"/>
and deale well by them whom he will honor so much. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5, 1. Sixtly, that all iniuries done to the Saints, cannot but prouoke God to indignation; as it would greeue vs to see any abused whom we loue.</p>

                     <p>Such, as being separated from the World, are consecrated to Christ, and haue his Spirit giuen them to worke holinesse in them: so as Saints bee persons sanctified by the Spirit, to liue holily and iustly. From hence we learne, two things: First, that such as still a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in their sinnes, and wallow in the mire of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane life, seruing diuers lusts and pleasures, they are no beleeuers, nor beloued of God; for all Beleeuers are Saints, that is; they are holy persons, louing and practising holinesse. Secondly, that they shall neuer be Saints in Heauen, who first be not Saints in Earth, Saints in <hi>Via</hi> inchoatiuely, ere they be Saints in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria,</hi> perfectly.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>What meaneth this, that it is said they were called to be Saints?</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That by an effectuall vocation God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (as it were) by speaking the word, did make them to be such indeed and truth, as they were called and named to be; to wit, Saints, or holy: and that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his gracious good will and pleasure, as was implyed in the Word (<hi>Beloued</hi>) to shew, that our Christian vocation floweth from his mercy.</p>
                     <p>This is moreouer well to bee obserued, that <hi>Paul</hi> hauing said of himselfe, in verse 1. that he was [<hi>Called to be an Apostle</hi>] and now twise, in verse 6. and 7. saith of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that they were [<hi>The Called of Christ, &amp; called to be Saints</hi>] that the word [<hi>Calling or Vocation</hi>] is vsed in a double sense, either in a more strict mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; for a Calling to a Function or Office, eyther ciuill; as to bee a Magistrate, a Captaine, &amp;c. or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall, immediatly, as to be a Prophet, an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, &amp;c. or mediate, called by the Church, as were
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:20835:18"/>
Doctors and Pastors: or else in a more large significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for calling into the common society of the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church; and this is eyther vnto the knowledge and profession of Christ, as of Hipocrites, by a generall and externall calling, when the word soundeth in the eare, to the enlightning of the mind, and some slight or slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der change of the heart; or, it is vnto the faith of Christ and vnto saluation through him, when both mind and heart are mightily perswaded by the Spirit, to obey the Caller, by belieuing his promises, and indeuouring to doe things commanded. This is an internal and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all calling, which <hi>Paul</hi> heere ascribeth vnto all the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine Christians; not that there were amongst them no counterfeits and vnbeleeuers, but because by Law and Iudgement of Charity, we are bound to esteeme all such for truely called and Saints, who outwardly professe themselues to be so, and doe not by their conuersation declare and euident the contrary, leauing to God the iudgement of certainty. Now, whereas hee writeth of these <hi>Romanes:</hi> that they were called to be Saints, or holy; we are further to learne a difference betweene Nature and Grace; that first we are by Nature vncleane and vnpure, destitute of personall holinesse: though not without foederall holinesse, being the seed of faithfull parents, men are not therefore called of God, because they are holy, but therefore they be Holy: because they are called of his Grace. Moreouer, couertly the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle heerein takes away the difference betweene <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that the <hi>Iewes</hi> may not boast, as if all holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse were in their kindred, and were tyed only to their stocke (as they foolishly dreame) for the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are called to the same glorious condition of holinesse. Touching Saints, the word noteth not any absolute perfection where there is no want: for no doubt but both <hi>Romanes, Corinthians,</hi> and others, who <hi>Paul</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth with the Title of [<hi>Saints</hi>] were sundry wayes faulty; but such as be consecrate to God, and besides the</p>

From whence we learne, that it is the dutie of euery faithfull Man, to reioyce for the well-doing of others, when they thriue and prosper in godlinesse. The Reasons of this duty be these following. First, because we are mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers one of another, and therefore ought to suffer to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and to reioyce together. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12, 26. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the well-doing, and spirituall prosperitie of other Christians, redowndeth to vs, who haue an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in all their guifts, as touching the vse and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of them, though not for the propriety of them; for euery Saint is the possessor of his owne graces, yet in the fruition and benefits, there is a communion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which we professe in our Creed, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Communion of Saints. Wherein we haue iust and great matter of reioycing and thanksgiuing. Thirdly, to reioyce at the welfare and the well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Brethren, is a Testimony, that wee haue Christ his Spirit, which is a Spirit of Charitie, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Enuy out of the hart, and in stead thereof, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting brotherly loue. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5, 22. 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 14, 4. This do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, serueth to reprooue the enuious and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, which either little regard and reioyce not at all;

or which is worse, doe repine and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>First, because all graces come to vs, through him our Mediator. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1, 14, 16. Secondly, because all thankes are accepted for him. 1. <hi>Peter.</hi> 2, 5. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all ability to be thankfull is giuen of him: for he with the father and the spiritis Author of euery grace. Now the same way which God takes in bestowing his graces, we are bound to follow it in returning thankes, that is; by Christ our High-Priest.</p>

Secondly, that God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be called vpon, as a witnesse of the trueth. Thirdly, that the matter be of waight and importance, not slight and triuiall. Fourthly, that there be such necessity, that without it we cannot be beleeued, it being a thing very requisite for the good of others, that credit should bee giuen to our wordes, as it did verie much behooue the <hi>Romanes</hi> to thinke well of <hi>Paul,</hi> whome they had neuer seene, and to beleeue him. From hence, are taxed three sorts of men: First, such as are common swearers vppon euerie light occasion, as prophane worldlings do.

Thirdly, such as are too scrupulous of an Oath, when there is iust cause to take it: as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists, who deny vnto the Christians, lawfull vse of Magistrates, Lawes, and Oathes (contrary to these eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Testimonies of Scripture: as <hi>Deut.</hi>

                     <p>This Particle [<hi>My</hi>] sheweth, that he speaks not of God his spirit, but of his owne spirit, and feruent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, 2. Tim. 1, 3. and it teacheth vs in what manner God is to be serued (1. Religiously worshipped) not in shew and ostentation; not in hipocrisie; not coldly and perfunctorily; not constrainedly, and by compulsion; not in body only, but in soule also: with Readynesse, 2. Cheerefulnesse, 3. sincerity, 4. feruency and innocency of heart; for these are things wherin Gods seruice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth. His internall worship standeth in Faith, Hope, Loue of God, feare of his name, Confidence, peace, ioy in the Holy-Ghost, patience in suffering, and obedience in doing his will; Prayer for his protection &amp; benefits, and thankfulnesse of heart, for his mercies of all sortes. His externall seruice, is placed in publicke prayer, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and hearing his word with reuerence and attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Communicating in the Holy Mysteries, prayses, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of Psalmes, &amp;c. All which parts of his seruice, wee are bound to performe vpon these Reasons. First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we were created of God, out of nothing. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because by the blood of his sonne, wee were redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med out of hell. Thirdly, out of many dangers of bodie and soule, we haue beene preserued. Fourthly, with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and manifold good things, we haue beene all our life long, plentifully and graciously blessed. Fiftly, God hath giuen vs both commaundement by his authoritie, and freedome with happy liberty, that wee may serue him. And lastly, promiseth to vs, not only felicitie on earth, but in heauen, so we will serue him: for Godlines hath the promises both of this life, and of that which is to come.</p>

Secondly, it may be meete that the flocke should know this Loue and Care of their Pastor, for them to enkindle the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of him the more: and especially, to gain their harts to receiue his instructions.

Thirdly, the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities of the Churches encreasing euery day more and more, occasioned the alteration of his purpose. <hi>Paul</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to giue this reason of his not comming to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> when he had decreed it: That the estate of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches where he remained, required his longer presence and helpe, for their better profiting in the Gospell, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15, 22. His imployment in other Churches deferred his comming
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20835:24"/>
to <hi>Rome,</hi> though he much &amp; long desired it. Whence let vs learne, that God according to his vncontrouleable wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doth order and direct the course of the Ministery to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he pleaseth: sometime causing the raine of Doctrine, to fall vpon one Citty or Country, and sometime on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: as hee seeth it meet for the commodity of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and for his owne name and honour. Also obserue, that God vseth to crosse the purposes of his Seruants and Saints being in snew good and holy, bringing to passe his owne decrees, at a further time; and after a farre other manner and way then men had determined. When God would preferre <hi>Ioseph,</hi> it was disliked of his Father and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, yet God brought it to passe by another meanes then they dreamed. <hi>Paul</hi> purposed to come to <hi>Rome</hi> to establish them, but he must doe it at such a time, &amp; in such a fashion as God would: for after many troubles suffered at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> he was sent bound to <hi>Rome,</hi> and God turned <hi>Paul</hi> to preach to the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> whereas he had meant to teach in <hi>Asia;</hi> yet <hi>Paul</hi> sinned not heerein, that his will was not agreeable to Gods secret will, for it is sinne to a man to transgresse his reuealed will. Hence it is, that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian with a good mind, may will that which God willeth not; as a good Child, with a good affection, may wish his fathers life, whom the Lord will haue to dye; againe, a man may wish with an euill mind, that which God willeth well; as a wicked Child may euilly desire his fathers death, which God iustly purposeth. Finally, note that Sathan casteth innumerable hinderances in the way of Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, to stop the edification of the Church, which should prouoke all the Seruants of Christ, with greater feruency to pray for the free passage and good successe of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; that the word of God (mauger Sathan and his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) may runne and be glorified: and if their prayers be not heard, yet to wait vpon God with patience, and to continue constant; considering, that <hi>Paul</hi> did not at the first obtaine what he earnestly and often craued touching his repaire to <hi>Rome:</hi> but at length, if they perseuer, God

will grant that which shall be expedient for his Church.</p>

Furthermore we learne, that where the Gospell is truely preached, it is neuer preached without fruit to life; because, wheresoeuer the Gospell is preached, there God hath a people, which must serue to a double vse: first, to encourage Ministers to teach: &amp; second ly, to encourage the people to liue vnder teaching Pastors.</p>

So as this Text consisteth of two parts: First, a profession, [<hi>I am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed:</hi>] Secondly, a Reason [<hi>For.</hi>] And whereas he saith [<hi>He is not ashamed</hi> it is a <hi>Liptote</hi> or <hi>Meiosis,</hi> because more is meant, then is spoken. For, it is as if hee had saide, I am so farre from being ashamed, and I do glory and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in it so, as I esteeme nothing so honourable: Insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating to the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that they ought likewise so to do, as he their Apostle did: according to that which he spake plainly (and without any figure) vnto the Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, Chap. 6, 14. Now when he tearmeth the Gospell (1. the Doctrine of free Iustification by Christ) [the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God] he meaneth not of his Creating power, or his reuenging power vnto destruction; but of a power ioyned with fauour and loue for saluation; not of his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall power, but of his Organicall Ministerial power;

For, by the Gospell, God mightilie moueth the hearts of the elect (when the houre of their conuersion commeth) infusing the Holy-ghost, which stirreth vp the vnbeleeuing heart, and makes it able to beleeue, whereby righteousnesse and saluation is obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thorow Christ.</p>

no cause to be ashamed of it. Secondly, the Nature of the Gospell, being a gladsome and ioyfull message. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the subiect of the Gospell, which is Christ: of whom, if we be ashamed before men, he will be ashamed of vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. Fourthly, because it is the Instrument of Gods power, to beget Faith. Fiftly, the effect of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, which is saluation, the greatest of all benefits; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it hath all safety in it, comprehending deliuerances of all sorts, both Temperall and Spirituall. For, whereas there be sundry and many kinds of saluations or safeties; as of our goods and persons, by good lawes and iust Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates; against sicknesle and diseases, by Phisitions and wholesome medecines, from violence and iniuries of ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; by valiant Captaines and Souldiors, from extremity of weather; by builders of houses or Masons, from colde, by Garments: as all these enemies, dangers, effects, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, came by sinne, and be effects of transgression, so our deliuerance and safety from them, is a fruit of Christ his redemption, and of that faith which embraceth it: but heere is chiefely meant, that saluation which is spirituall, and is of the soule, from sinne and eternall death, whereof there be two parts; the first part, is deliuerance from guilt and punishment of sinne, by remission; the second, is bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sednesse and eternall life in the possession of Gods fauour and loue, whereof there be three degrees. First, in this life, at the time of regeneration, when sinne being pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned through Faith, and the soule renewed by the Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ghost, it beginneth to liue that life which is eternall. The second at death, when the Soule seuered from the body, is receiued into <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome, to rest in heauen, with the Spuits of iust men. The third, at the day of Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, when the whole man shall be glorified with Christ euerlastingly. This is that Saluation, whereunto the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell bringeth the embracers of it. Moreouer, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is preached to some vnto destruction, it happeneth by the infidelity of men. For the Gospell of it owne Nature, and by the counsell of God, is appointed to bee cause of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:20835:28"/>
Saluation. Wherein it diftereth from the Law, whose ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is to reueale wrath for sinne, not to iustify and saue sinners, propounding life indeed, but it is vnto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect keepers: whereas the Gospell offereth and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth Saluation to the beleeuer, euen to euery beleeuer, without difference of Nationꝭ and so the promises of the Gospell are vniuersall, both in respect of al beleeuers which receiue it; and also, because no Age, Sex Nation, Estate or condition, is excluded from perticipation of Christ, &amp; life eternall, so they belieue. Lastly in the tenth Chapter of this Epistle, verse, 13, 14, 15. <hi>Paul</hi> frameth the Ladder (as I may so speake) by which, the Gospell causeth men to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend, and climbe vnto the marke of eternall Saluation in Heauen; whereof, the first steppe is sending of Teachers to preach the Gospell. The second, is preaching. The third, is hearing of the Gospell preached. The fourth, Faith by hearing. The fift, Confession and Inuocation of God. The sixt and last, is Saluation it selfe.</p>

Lastly, we belieue men which are lesse faithfull then God, by many thousand degrees: and if we belieue the witnesse of men, how much more ought we to receiue the testimony and record of God? 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 5, 9. By these reasons, we must fight against all motions of vnbeliefe, and inforce our selues to vse all good meanes to preserue and increase Faith.</p>

This Text then, dooth well and fitly serue to a double purpose and end. First, it is brought in, as a reason of the definition of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, set down in verse 16. For, if by the Doctrine of the Gospell be plainly and effectually shewed and taught, the onely right way of attaining righteousnesse before God, (which neither Law, nor Philosophy, nor anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther learning can teach) then is the Gospell the mighty Instrument vsed of God, to saue beleeuers. Secondly, it briefly putteth forth the whole state and proposition of the disputation, following to the end of the 11. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to wit; That by Faith alone (without Woorkes) elect sinners be Iustified, before the iudgement of God. Which is proued by a testimony of <hi>Habakuk.</hi>

                     <p>The integrity of humaine Nature, beeing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed wholy to the will and Image of God: this inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity is only to be found in Christ inherently, and such as he will impute it vnto of fauour and mercy. By the righteousnesse of God in this place, we may neither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand his essentiall righteousnesse, whereby he is iust and righteous in himselfe; louing Innocencie, hating Iniquity. <hi>Psal.</hi> 11, 7. &amp; 45, 7. nor yet his Distributiue Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciary righteousnesse, whereby he rewards the Good, and in seuerity of Iudgement is reuenged on the Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1 23. 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 5. for these are not, or can bee communicated to men by Faith: neyther yet by Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse is meant, that habite of Iustice and Charity, infused of God into our minds, whereby wee are made apt to do good-workes. For this is manifested by the Law, and stands in working, not in beleeuing. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3, 20, 21. But whither we vnderstand the perfect Iustice of Christ in his Nature, actions, and sufferings, satisfying fully Gods wrath for sinne, with the communicating &amp; application thereof, to elect sinners by Faith; or the Mercie, grace, and clemency of God, declaring it selfe in freely pardoning sinners, iustifying them also, renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hearts withall, that they may loue the Law, &amp; abhorre vice. Lastly, giuing them pure and sincere acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and manners, which be the necessary fruits &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of forgiuenesse of sinnes and imputed Iustice, it skilleth not much. For, in many places, the word [<hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse,</hi>] signifieth the goodnesse and mercy of God, remitting sinnes, and deliuering from the punnishment thereof, for the merit of Christ, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 31, 2. and 35, 4. &amp; 1. Sam. 12, 7. and often elsewhere; and may so bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken heere. Howbeit, the best Interpretation, is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it of the full obedience of Christ to death, impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to faithfull persons for remission of sinnes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:20835:29"/>
Iustice before God: which is therefore called [<hi>The Righteousnesse of God</hi>] because it is his meere guifte, and commeth not by workes, or any humain strengths. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9, 30. Secondly, it alone satisfieth the most rigorous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Iustice of God; and makes sinners iust, not before men, but in the sight of God.</p>

                     <p>Not from one Faith to another, but from one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Faith to another: from weaker faith to stronger, from a lesser Faith to a greater. Whereas this phrase [<hi>From Faith to Faith</hi>] by diuerse Interpreters is diuersly expounded: as from an vnformed Faith, to a formed, which is Popish: from the Faith of the Preacher, to the Faith of the hearer: (Thus <hi>Augustine,</hi> but amisse) for a mans owne faith iustifieth: therefore, from faith of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, to faith of posterity, is amisse: also, from the faith of the old Testament, to the faith of the new (as <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom</hi> thought) not wel, nor fitly: from the Faith of one Article, to the Faith of another (as <hi>Anselme</hi> writeth:) from the faith of things present, to the faith of thinges to come, as the resurrection, &amp;c: From the faith of God promising, to the faith of man beleeuing, as <hi>Ambrose &amp; Martyr</hi> thinke; yet the fittest and best exposition is of the measure of one and the same faith: from faith begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:20835:30"/>
to Faith encreasing toward perfection; Faith, so much the more it groweth, so much the more it maketh men sure of their Iustification: there be the like phrases to this, else-where, in holy Scripture, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 84, 8. from strength to strength, &amp; 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3, 16. from glory to glory, first, from one degree of strength and glory to another; so heere, from an infirme Faith, to a firme Faith. Therefore the meaning of this forme of speech, is, as if it should bee said, that this righteousnesse of God is gotten not by the workes of the Law, but by the Faith of the Gospell alone; for degrees of Faith alter not the kind of Faith; a weake and a strong Faith be but one Faith, which without deed doth iustifie; according to that which is afterward writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for explication of this Text, in Chap. 3. verse. 22.</p>

                     <p>These few things: First, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> citeth not so much the verse, as the Booke of Scripture wherein it is written. Secondly, that he contenteth himselfe, to proue Doctrine by authority of Scripture. Thirdly, that he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth but one Testimony. Fourthly, that the Doctrine of free pardon and imputed righteousnesse, is hard to bee perswaded vnto men, yet hath witnesse from the Prophets. It hath euer seemed to humane reason very repugnant, and a thing vnlikely to be true; that a wicked liuer, a periured
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:20835:31"/>
person, a common lyer, a railer, an oppressor, an vnchast liuer, a blood-sucker, or such like; only by belieuing the Gospell, should suddenly become iust, and be accounted righteous and vnblameable. Against which Doctrine, the Papists to this day like Dogs doe barke, railing at it, and the Preachers of it, saying; that it ouerthrowes all Lawes and Discipline, and takes away out of mens society, all vse of punnishments and rewards, laying open a gappe to all wickednesse, (if it should be preached,) that without righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous works, without any habite or actions of iustice, only by Faith in Christ, sinners may bee iustified with God. Therefore, out of good discretion, to stoppe the mouths of calumnious slanderers, and to put humane reason to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, <hi>Paul</hi> citeth this place of the Prophet, least he bee thought to haue brought in a Doctrine full of nouelty and absurdity; it being receiued long before in the Iewish Church, by authority of propheticall Oracle, which is three times alleadged in the new Testament. First, Heere. Secondly, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3, 11. Thirdly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. to illustrate this Doctrine of iustice and life eternall, to be had by faith alone; and howsoeuer the Prophet who first vsed these words, might aime (in part) at the refreshing and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the godly in those troublous times, vnder <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezar,</hi> when their captiuity was sharpe, and their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance long deferred; yet because temporal deliuerance were Tipes of eternall, and depended vpon Christ, it is not to be doubted, but <hi>Paul</hi> hath rightly applied it to the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall deliuerance, by the <hi>Messiah</hi> to come, through Faith. Wherby the elect (both vnder Law and Gospel) were safe, and made pertakers as well of Iustification and remission of sinnes presently, as of life eternall in the Heauens. Which concord, in this great trueth of righteousnesse by<note place="margin">Papists must blame the Prophets and Apostles, and not vs.</note> Faith, betweene the Prophets and Apostles, it is implied not obscurely, by this Particle [<hi>As</hi>] and whereas <hi>Paul</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribeth vnto holy Scripture, the authority to proue the question in hand; whether Faith or workes do iustifie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; we may note further in what estimation wee

ought to haue the written word; namely, to account it the perfect rule of al diuine truth: acording to which, we ought to examine and iudge of al controuersies in matter of Faith and Religion; for it is the wont of this blessed Apostle when he will confirme any Christian Doctrine, or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine any doubt or question, which may arise about it, still to runne vnto Scriptures for probation; which shewes the Scriptures alone to be a sufficient directory, and a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Iudge of all controuersies in Religion.</p>

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:20835:33"/>
righteousnes of the Law, men do giue it to God. There is good vse of this difference, and is to be held constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because it freeth the trobled Conscience from snares and perplexities, when hee shall perceiue, that though he lacke good Workes, and be full of wicked manners, yet vnto the forgiuenesse of sinnes, and absolution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, it is enough only to beleeue in Christ, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the gospel. Secondly, it takes from man, al cause of reioycing and glorying in himselfe, that he may glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry only in this; That he knowes God to be mercifull, to pardon his sinne, and accept him for righteous, when by his sinfull Workes, and transgressions of the Lawe, hee deserued death. Ier. 9, 23.</p>

                     <p>The drift and purpose, is to confirm the maine and grand proposition, that sinners are Iustified and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the Faith of the gospell. The argument is from the contrary; Sinners are not Iustified by their Works, therefore by Faith. For, in the cause of Iustification, faith and workes haue the condition of contraries. <hi>Rom</hi> 11 6. Now, touching things which be immediately contrarie the maxime and rule is; that when the one is denied, the other is affirmed; and what is taken from the one, is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the other; it doth then necessarily followe, that righteousnesse must be had by Faith, seeing it cannot be had by workes. Aud why not by workes? Was it not the common and generally receiued opinion, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:20835:33"/>
Philosophers, and the Iewes themselues; that Workes were the cause of righteousnesse? To this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Obiection, the Apostle answereth, by a reason ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the contrary effects, as thus; Men cannot bee righteous by their Workes, because their workes: were wicked and vniust, &amp; therefore punished of God which he proueth by a distribution of Gentiles, vnto Chap. 2.

                     <p>In holy Scriptures [<hi>Wrath &amp; Anger</hi>] bee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise attributed vnto men, then vnto God. For, it is in men properly, as it is a perturbation of the minde infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming or stirring vp to Reuenge. Wrath, in his proper acception, is an appetite or desire of reuenge, for some contempt or hurt, done or supposed to be done to our selues or others, whom we affect. When men see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues neglected or wronged, straight way they are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to take vengeance on the party: thus it is in Men; the truth whereof, appeareth in <hi>Came, Esau, Achab,</hi> &amp;c. whereas in God, wrath is (no affection) but a iust act of God, punishing wickednesse, or the punishments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues of warre, famine, pestilence, sicknesse, &amp;c. inslic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for iniquity; so it is vsed in this Text. For it is here set against righteousnesse of God, spoken of verse 17, which (as wee haue saide) signifieth both his mercifull goodnesse, freely bestowing Iustice and life eternall vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:20835:34"/>
beleeuers: and also, Iustice or life, giuen and bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed graciously. Therefore, by wrath, we must vnderstand both his indignation, reuenging impiety; and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge or paines themselues, according to the Hebrew phrase. Now, this wrath is saide to be [<hi>Reuealed</hi>] that is; to be declared by examples, and by experience testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. For howsoeuer sundry wayes Gods wrath bee Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed against sinne (as by the light of nature) euerie mans Conscience, naturally accusing and tormenting him for euill doing. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. Secondly, by the Gospell, whose voice is not only Consolatory, speaking pardon and life vnto beleeuing offenders, but Comminatorie,<note place="margin">This is by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, and not of the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence &amp; Na ture of the Gospell.</note> threatning death eternal to impenitent persons and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeuers, as Mat. 3, 10. Luke 13, 3. Ioh. 3, 18, 36. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the Law, whose office is to reueale wrath, and the curse against euery transgression. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. v. last. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4, 15. yet our present text, would bee taken of that daily experience, which witnesseth, that God is wrathfullie displeased with the worlde for sinne: and euen at that time when the Apostle wrote, there were greeuous mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series of sword, plague, and famine abroad in the world. Also, it is plain by the verses following, that <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of such iudgements as God had executed vpon all men, for contempt of his Maiesty, especially of spirituall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments in hardning mens hearts, and giuing them vp to vile lusts, and a Reprobate mind, Verse 24, 28.</p>

sinne. The duties whereunto it should prouoke men be; First, to beware of murmuring, in time of calamity; for this is to fight Gyant-like against God. Secondly, to be patient, and contented, because it is Gods doing for iust ends: this is to submit vnto God. Thirdly, to sue and seeke, first and principally vnto God for remouing calamities, as <hi>Israelites</hi> in <hi>Iudges, Nininuites</hi> in <hi>Ionas</hi> did.</p>

                     <p>This verse with the rest that follow to the end of the first Chapter, doe by a very plaine and distinct order, more fully explicate and declare the matters briefly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely set downe in the 18, verse; as first, what that truth is which the Heathens did vniustly detaine, viz: the principles of Nature imprinted within them, both of God and of morall dutyes; and how they came by this naturall light, in this verse and next. Secondly, how by vniust detaining that truth, they proued impious to God by vnthankfulnesse and Idolatry, and iniurious towards themselues and their Neighbours, from verse 20, till 32. in which verse, lastly is taught what that wrath and punnishment is, which is from God in Heauen, reuealed and sent vpon such wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of men. Now the first word or Particle of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Text [<hi>Because</hi>] or, [<hi>For</hi>] bewraieth this verse, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon the former, as a reason thereof taken from the effect. He had said, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> violently oppressed truth, and as a Iaylor his Prisoner, so they kept in the same, which yet desired to burst out into actions as the Sun out of the Clouds: this he proueth thus, because such as had a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine light and knowledge to leade them to God in some sort to know him, and to discerne betweene good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill in common life, could not commit such impieties to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, such vncleannesses against themselues, and such Iniustice to their Neighbours, but that they must bee iudged guilty of vnrighteous detention and suppression of the truth. If happily any would alleadge for the Heathens in their defence, that they wholly wanted the knowledge of the truth, and so are vntruely charged for with-hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; for answere to this secret obiection he affirmeth; that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> had the knowledge of God, both by light of Nature, verse. 19. and by the view of Gods works v. 20.</p>

                     <p>No, but knew somuch as they were capable to knowe, according to such meanes as they had, yet the Philosophers and wise men knew much of God, which they did not reueale to the common people. There are some things to be knowne of God, which are incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible simply, and cannot be known of Gods regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Children, much lesse of Philosophers; as his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit diuine essence, &amp; most glorious maiesty, which dwels in a light that none hath accesse or aproach vnto. 1, Tim. 6, 16. Also the reasons of his will and counsell touching the gouernement of the worlde, and especially of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, for they ought not to be searched, nor can be tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and found. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 33. And other things there be, which though they bee comprehensible, yet are not known without reuelation of the word and spirit (which Heathens lacked) as the Doctrine of the Trinity, of Christ his Incarnation, free Iustification by Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Sinnes by a crucified Christ, Resurrection, &amp;c. By that therefore which may be knowne, is meant that which by ir-bred principles of truth, remayning in man after the fall, as some sparkles and fire-brands after a great fire; and by strength of naturall reason, as also by sight of the creature, the Gentiles coulde attaine vnto, viz. that there was a God, &amp; he insensible and spirituall,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:20835:37"/>
and for properties most mighty, most iust, most wise and good, which things they saw God the first cause could not bee without, seeing men, which were his effect and work, had such qualities in them. Whereas this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is said here to be manifest (in them) it is expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Chap. 2, vers. 15. written in their hearts, neither in the Creatures, nor in the Philosophers, nor among them, nor to them, but in themselues, euen within their hearts: by which it is plaine, that he now speakes not of the Iewes, which had their knowledge of God from the word, but of the Gentiles and of those inward notions and principles which be natural; whereof some be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templatiue, shewing them of God that hee is, and what one he is: and some practicke, teaching them the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene that is godly and wicked, iust &amp; wrong, honest and vnhonest, morally good and euill. Hence outwardly did arise the seeds of Arts, Sciences and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciplines, and within a conscience, iudgeing of a mans owne deedes, whether good or ill; and admonishing of the diuine iudgement, approouing and rewarding what is well done, abhorring and reuenging euill actions; as Chap. 2. 15. This iustifieth that saying of <hi>Augustine,</hi> that by <hi>Adams</hi> fall all supernaturall things (such as enabled to please God, and concerned eternal life) are quite lost; whereas mans naturall guiftes are but onely wounded and impairied, not wholy extinct, somuch abiding as is sufficient to free him from excuse, not to bring him to eternall life; that must bee done by the Grace which Christ hath brought in the Reuelation of the Gospell as before, Verse 15. 16. 17.</p>

                     <p>God himselfe, who is the Authour of true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as it is written, God shewed it them: this witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to vs, that beside naturall light of minde, God did concurre withall, continually helping nature, and the weaknes of natural discourse, giuing strength to natural faculties and powers (much maymed by originall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption;)
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:20835:37"/>
that they might doe their office the better, in collecting and concluding effects by consideration of causes. Hence it came, that amongst the Heathens there were such worthy men, as <hi>Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca, Pliny, Plautus, Plotinus, &amp; Paracelsus,</hi> besides other moe which haue diued so deepe into the secrets of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and haue written so many true thinges very lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly, both of Celestiall creatures, and humainc duties; euen because God was present by efficacie to stirre vp those instructions and principles which himselfe had first engrauen in Mans nature. If any bee desirous to know what the meanes are, by which God shewed and manifested in them what might bee knowne of him; it was neither inquisition and search of the written word, nor illumination of the spirit, nor humaine instruction, nor Angelicall Reuelation, nor miraculous operations, or diuine visions, for these were the priuiledges of his Church &amp; people; but the meanes were meere naturall, as principles ingrafted, discourse of reason assisted with a diuine concurrence, &amp; obseruation of the Creatures, by which (being visible) well marked and duely consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, their minds were erected (as by a ladder) to think vpon the nature and properties of God, which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible and inuisible. For God being an essence separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from matter, and not subiect to senses, must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of men by some outward signes of wordes (as to the Iewes,) of Creatures as to the Gentiles; who by the beholding and experience of things created, haue their knowledge of the Creator more and more polished and encreased. The Doctrine and lesson which from all this<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> wee are to learne, it is, that whatsoeuer knowledge of God or duties the Gentiles got, they were beholding to God for it: who though he vsed certain Organs and Instruments both within man and without him, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender this knowledge, yet this honour still remaines to God, that hee bee the Authour and giuer of it, and hence is entitled a God of Knowledge, which serueth
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:20835:38"/>
to reprooue such of wicked vnthankfulnesse, las forgetting God, doe ascribe their great knowledge in diuine, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and humaine things vnto their owne industry, or to the second causes which were vsed for this is to rob God of his glory. Withall it must admonish vs, that fithence God delights in meanes and workes by them, (albeit hee is not tyed to them) that therefore howsoeuer it is our sinne to set them in Gods roome, by trusting in them, or referring all praise to them: yet it is our duty not to neglect them when wee haue them at hand, least wee be found to tempt God.</p>
                     <p>Nowe I pray you passe forward vnto the 20. verse, which seemeth (as I conceiue it) to be joyned to the 19. by a Preoccuption; For it might be obiected, that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inuisible, is vnsensible also, and therefore could not be knowne, because nothing commeth to the vnderstanding but by the senses; to which the Apostle replyeth, first by concession, that indeed God is not to bee seene and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by sense: and then by a secret correction, that (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding) beside that inward manifestation of himselfe by naturall instinct, or imprinted light, hee hath outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the things created, reuealed himselfe, and what may be knowne of him.</p>

Thirdly, that hee must needs be Almighty, which made all things out of nothing,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:20835:38"/>
and sustained such a masse of Creatures. Fourthly, the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, variety and distinction of his Creatures declare his maruelous wisedome.

                     <p>It made them excuselesse (that is) it tooke from them excuse of ignorance, which they could not plead for themselues. That this must bee the exposition of these words (so as they are without excuse) appeareth not onely by the testimony of sundry learned men; as of <hi>Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir,</hi> auouching that God reuealed himselfe to Heathens, not to this end, on Gods part to take away excuse but the same hapned thorough their owne default, that they had no other vse of their knowledge: So faith <hi>Pareus</hi> this came <hi>eorum culpa,;</hi> so <hi>Gualter, Gentium vitie</hi> by their own fault; so <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> by a consequent and euent vppon abuse of their knowledge, not as a proper directly intended end: but also by strength of reason for the end properly, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally and by it selfe, why God by those two Bookes of Nature and Creatures did manifest himselfe so farre as hee did to men, was his owne Glorie and mans Happines sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate thereunto; that men acknowledging and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying him whome they knew might be blessed, as Ver, 21. doth not obscurely insinuate. In that it sell out otherwise, this was accidentally through Sinne, blotting out and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facing Gods Image, the remainders whereof (being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alperuerted) are weaker then to leade men to their ends, strong to remoue excuse of ignorance.</p>

                     <p>They could not do so, because they thought ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue was in their owne power.

                     <p>First, that God loues to cleare his Iustice, from murmuring and complaints.

In all which, the Apostle saith, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Vaine</hi>] both because they were deceiued of their opinion, neither obtained the end they aimed at. For, whereas they thought (by such their deepe and wise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions)
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:20835:41"/>
to haue procured Gods fauour also, to enioy his blessings, and escape calamities, and to gaine vnto themselues an opinion of great wisedom, they met with the quite contrarie. For, they offended God, purchased many temporall plagues, and spirituall too; and at last, were wrapt in cternall destruction, because (like fooles which had their vnderstandings darkened, they prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their owne vanities before truth, shadowes before substance, Idolles before the true God; like Children, which set more by a Rattle or a toy, then by Treasure, Gold, and Siluer, and such precious things From which we may learne, vvhat yssue and successe may bee looked for, of all humane inuentions in Gods seruice, and what they will proue at length, who frame their opinions and worship of God, not according to that truth seated in the heart by God, and shining in his workes, or after the prescript of his word. All such will not only be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate of their expectation, and finde that all their glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wisedome, is but meere blindnesse, foolishnesse, &amp; darknesse: but will incurre the high displeasure of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and pull on their owne heads, his heame vengeance, as these Idolatrous Gentiles did. An happy thing were it for Papists, and all other superstitious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which forsaking the sure directions of God, follow their owne peruerse reasonings, and thrust vppon God Will-worships and good intentions (as they be called) to take warning in time by the harmes which came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Heathens, for their rash godlesse presumption in this kinde, whereof more shall be said in the subsequent Verses.</p>

O Paul why doe you accuse the Heathenish people of foolishnes and darknesse of mind; doe you not knowe that they tooke themselues to bee wise, and had a same among men for great wisedome, yea &amp; had the name (their teachers I meane) of Philosophers, that is persons studious, and louers of wisedome? The Romaynes had their <hi>Cato,</hi> and diuers others renowned for great wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:<note place="margin">Act. 7, 22.</note> and Greece had her seauen wisemen. In Egipt were men learned in al wisedome; and do we not reade of wise men which came out of the East from amongst Heathens, to enquire where the king of the Iewes should be borne? To this obiection the Apostle answereth, first granting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that in their owne opinion, and by profession to the world, they were esteemed for wonderfull wise men; yet indeed and very trueth they were fooles: because by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and leaping out of the boundes of that knowledge which God had imprinted in their mind, and manifested in his woorkes; and following their owne witty inuentions and sharpe conceits, they fell from that worship of GOD whereunto their engrauen light, and the sight of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ature called them, vnto most grosse &amp; abhominable Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry; not only making such their Gods as were but Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atures, yea the basest Creatures, euen creeping things had diuine honour giuen them: but changing (what lay in them) the true Immortall and Spirituall God, and his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Maiesty into earthly corruptible and contemptible shewes and similitudes, which they adored religiously, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking the right spiritual worshippe of the onely true God, and so became fooles or rather mad in their folly, because

                     <p>Vpon what pretences and apparance of reason did the wisest of the Heathens maintaine their heathenish Idolatry, in making Creatures Gods, and woorshipping God by Images, also making pictures and shapes of God: what had they to say? what did they professe to bee the ground and motiue of such su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition?</p>

                     <p>Their pretexts and excuses deuised out of humane witte (wandering from light of nature) were sundry; not much vnlike (and some the very same) with these which our Papists stragling from the light of the worde, now doe vse in the very like case for defence of their abhominable Idolles; and which sometime the Israelites did pleade for<note place="margin">Fxod. 32.</note> themselues, when they declined from Gods loue and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,<note place="margin">Ezek 8. 10.</note> to such their owne inuentions. As first, that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Spirit separate from sense, therefore the people whose vnderstandings were grosse, must haue God visible by some shape. Againe, that they were not so foolish as to thinke the Images to be God, but only tokens and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances, and helps whereby to come to God: that as men come to Emperours by vnder-officers, so accesse to God must be by Saints, and inserior Gods; which excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and such like, are answered by <hi>Athanasius, Ambrose,</hi> and <hi>Augustine.</hi>

                     <p>Now let mee know of you, in what respect the true God is called incorruptible; seeing mens Soules and Angels be so too, and how his glory can be said to bee changed, seeing it is immutable as himselfe is? For me thinks it doth wel follow, that God being incorruptible cannot change; and as himselfe is, so is his glory exempted from change, why then doth Paul say, they changed it?</p>

                     <p>The Angels and mens Soules be incorruptible, that is, free from corruption, alteration and change; not ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally by themselues, but by the will of God, who him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe is such of himselfe, most necessarily and euerlastingly exempt from chaunge and mutation: yea and his glory also absolutely considered, is such as shall abide the same
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:20835:43"/>
for euer, though heauen and earth passe away, it shall not alter: but his glory being relatiuely considered in respect of men as it is to be honoured and worshipped of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Creatures, it may bee and is often changed by the lewd impiety of wicked Idolaters, who corrupt his glorie two wayes; both by making vnto them Gods, which by nature are not so, giuing diuine honour and seruice to things Created: and secondly by representation of God in visible shapes and Images, adoring him in and by such pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and shewes as men fancy of him; and after both these sortes did the Gentiles dishonour God, worshipping for Gods such as had not diuinity in them, also by framing similitudes of God to which they attributed diuine honor by erecting vnto them Temples and Altars, also offering sacrifices and prayers vnto the figures of men, beasts, and creeping creatures, so foolish they were and without vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</p>

                     <p>That is not so, for they turned his glory into a base similitude, as of creeping things, which is a great dishonour to him.

which was the very Root and Mother of such abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Children and branches, as filthy lusts and vniust acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be: that which he called the changing of his glory, in verse 23, now he tearmeth the turning of his truth, that is, those true principles touching Gods eternall power and God-head, engrafted in their mindes; and that which before he named the Image or likenesse of a corruptible man, is heere named (falsity or a lye) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it represents him falsly, and ascribeth to him a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kind of worship: for God will not be eyther pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied by an Image, or serued in an Image, or by or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one.

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, because when God is represented by an Image, something is attributed and giuen to him, which he is not; as that he should be visible, finite, incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensible, mortall, corruptible, earthly. Secondly, that is denied him, and taken away from him, which in trueth is his owne, namely; his eternity, immensity, inuisible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, immortality. So euery Image of God, is a false and lying representation.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>First, because from Idolles was taken away that which they were, for they were no more counted wood and stone, though in truth they still were so. Secondly, that was yeilded to them by Idolators, which they were not; as namely, the likenesse of God, to wit; of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and nature of God.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That there be two degrees of Idolatry. First, to make Images of the Deity. Secondly, to serue and giue them worship, by outward gestures of kneeling, lifting vp hands, praying before them, offering Incense, &amp;c.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <p>When it is said [they worshipped the Creature aboue the Creator] is it meant they worshipped both Images &amp; God, but Images more then God?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>No, they did not somuch as giue the second place to God, but wholly neglected him, being whollie ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to the worship of the Creature.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Is this true in all Idolaters which worship Images?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It is so: for whatsoeuer they pretend, yet God is not worshipped at all, where he is not worshipped a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and alone: therefore, is Idoll-seruice tearmed in

                     <p>What learne we from the end of the sentence, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he saith of God, he is to be praised for euer?</p>

                     <p>Thus much, that Idolaters haue no good successe of their enterprise with their practise: for, howsoeuer they seeke to rob God of his glorie, and to change his truth for a lye, yet he remaines God, to bee praised and blessed for euer: for all that men can do, is not able to alter Gods glorie or truth, he abideth alwaies one and the same, like himselfe, God, woorthy to be blessed for euer. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9, 5.</p>

                     <p>This speech of [<hi>Deliuering vp</hi>] our Apostle seemeth to haue taken it out of the Psalme 81. 12. where God saith thus, <hi>My people haue not hearkened &amp;c. therefore I haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered them vp vnto the frowardnesse of their hearts, that they might walke after their owne counsels.</hi> This [<hi>Deliuering vp</hi>] comprehends the soure actions, whereof the first is, that God with-draweth his grace, both light of knowledge,<note place="margin">God blindeth men saith August when he doth not ealighten them, and hardens whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he doth not sosten.</note> and gouernment of his spirit; which being remoued, the sinner must needs fall into wickednesse, as a staffe falleth when the hand is remoued which vpheld it; and as the earth is couered with darkenesse when the light of the Sun is gon from it; or as a Ship must sinke when Mariners are all gon out of it. In this action God is iust, for it is a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous thing with God, to forsake such as first willingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from him, and to take his grace from such as do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne<note place="margin">2 Chro. 15. 2.</note> it, and hate to bee ledde by it. The next action of God in giuing vp a Sinner, is, that beside forsaking him, he also stirreth vp his lusts, and enclineth them vnto euill, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst which, <hi>Dauid</hi> prayeth in 119. Psalme: <hi>Lord incline not my heart vnto Couetousnesse.</hi> And of this <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, God turneth the hearts of Kings whither he will, as the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers of water: also in the Psalme it is written, God turned the hearts of the Egyptians, that they should hate his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Israel; vnto which may be added, sundry such like sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences out of <hi>Esay</hi> 63. <hi>Ioshua</hi> 11. 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.

                        </gap>, that beside suffering, and forsaking, God deliuereth by a certaine incitation; that though he put the motion of Sinne into no mans heart, yet he inciteth, inclineth and disposeth it whither hee will; as one that hath power, not onely ouer the bodies, but ouer the mindes of men also. God, sayeth <hi>Augustine,</hi> worketh in the harts of men, to incline their wils whither soeuer it pleaseth him, either to good things, according to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or to euill things, according to his Iustice; and that by his iudgement, being sometime open, &amp; sometime secret, but alwayes iust. His third action is, offering and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting occasions of sinning, to such as bee already desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of his grace: whereunto pertaineth that in the Psalm, that their Table should be a trappe and stumbling blocke.<note place="margin">Psal. 69. 22.</note> And who knoweth not that false Prophets were a snare to <hi>Achab,</hi> &amp; occasions of his error? 1, <hi>Kings.</hi> 18. And that the aduersities which hapned to the Egyptians in their owne Land, and to the Israelites in the wildernes, were occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to the one of more hardning, &amp; to the other of blasphemy and infidelity? These occasions happen, both inwardly by motions and thoughts suggested to the minde, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by troubles, pleasures, plenty, &amp;c. Which when they light vpon a good heart guided by Gods grace, turn to their good, and further them to amendment of life; but if they happen vpon a wicked minde, they are occasion of greater and more sinne, vnto which yet by inbred corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they are prone enough. The last action of God in this iudgement of [Deliuering] is the putting ouer an vngodly person, which refuseth to be ruled by God, vnto the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and power of Sathan, and their owne vile passions, to bee more and more defiled and alienated from God: that as they like best to bee led by them, so they should be giuen vp to their own deuises which they loue; which fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vnto them from God, as a punishment, and all execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of punishment hath the condition of goodnesse and iustice in it; and seeing all men that so are punished, do first by their iniquities deserue to bee deliuered; and finally are
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:20835:47"/>
not compelled, but doe euill freely by their owne consent; therefore God so effecteth this punishment of giuing vp to vncleannesse, as hee is in no wise authour of the vncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, as it is a sinne: for he is a God who willeth no iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, no vnrighteousnes shall dwell with him: and as hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely hateth sinne, being contrary to his most holy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and pure Law, so hee will extreamly and eternally pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish it: wherein he could not be iust, were hee the author of sinne, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>That in the vncleane actions of the wicked, God is more then a sufferer, euen a iust auenger, and so by his will and power, willeth and effecteth their wicked workes as his righteous iudgements.

Also if we shall shut out God from dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the works of wicked men, wee should depriue him of more then the one halse of the gouernment of mankinde, and rob him to his great dishonor, both of his prouidence and omnipotency; if wee make him but an idle beholder and looker on, and a bare sufferer, as if something might be done which he would not haue done, or could not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, then where is his Almightinesle? And how truely is it written, that none can resist his will? &amp; he works all things after the counsell of his will, and doth whatsoeuer pleaseth him in heauen and earth? for by this Doctrine of naked and idle permission, something should bee done, which God is not pleased nor willing to haue done.

The third thing is Anti-iustice, the recompence or retribution for former offences; this is from God as Author: for it is iust<note place="margin">Esay. 3, 10, 11</note> with God, to render to men after their workes, good<note place="margin">2 Thes. 1, 6, 7.</note> to them which do good, and euill to such as do euill: &amp; here we haue the end wherefore God deliuereth to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane and vile lusts, that by order of Iustice he may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay sinners their due.</p>

                     <p>First, it is a fruit of the flesh. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5, 20. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is the breach of Charity. Thirdly, it disgraceth our profession. 1, <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 2, 3, 4. Fourthly, it is a sport to Sathan, who delights himselfe in setting vs togither by the cares. Fiftly, it is an offence to God. Sixtly, it is a scandall to his Church, 1, <hi>Cor.</hi> 11, 12. Seauenthly, the end of it is very fearefull, whereas peace is both pleasant and profitable. Lastly, it maketh vs vnlike to Christ and good men, who seeke and pursue peace: and like to Sathan and wicked men, who delight in strife and warre. Therefore the best way is, either not to open the flood-gate of debate, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opened to stop betimes, for none knoweth what will be in the end; as in deseases, so debates stay them in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>

                     <p>First, it is a member of the old man. Secondly, it is a breach of the law of God which commaundeth sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, and forbiddeth guile.

Fourthly, they both report false thinges, or speake trueth to an euill end.

Lastly,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:20835:55"/>
how vnfit we are to any good, and that al the good wee haue or doe, it is giuen vs, 1 Cor. 4, 7. Finally, pride in the minde is the same, that a swelling is in the body.</p>

                     <p>In two things: First, in choise of their Calling or Trade of life. Secondly, in their marriage and choise of their yoake fellow. This may appeare by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our first Parents, whose marriage God their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made. Secondly, by the example of <hi>Isaac, Iacob, Sampson,</hi> who were ruled by their Parents in their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. Thirdly, by 1. Cor. 7. Fourthly, Children are more in power of their Parents, then their other goods. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the Law of Vowes, <hi>Num.</hi> 30, 4, 5. for if a promise made of a Childe to God, is of no force when parents dissent, much more may parents breake the promise which their children shall make of themselues to other men. Lastly, Marriages made without consent of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are against the Law of Nature, and of the Lord, &amp; are commonly accursed of God.</p>

                     <p>First, it is against the fift commandement, which saith, honour them, Ephes. 6, 1. Secondly, it is against the Instruments of our life, education, and learning. Thirdly, it is against the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which bear the image of Gods authority.

                     <p>First, it is against Gods commandement and nature. Secondly, it maketh men also to bee mercilesse to vs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause wee cannot pitty them that are in misery; the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were full of cruelties, as also the Turks in their wars, shedding the bloud of men, women and children without all pitty; casting men to beastes, and causing men to kill one another at sword playing.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the forenamed sins which are 23. in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, we are generally to obserue these few and short notes. First, that he first setteth downe one worde (vnrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesle,) which comprehends them that follow, as kindes and parts of vnrighteousnes. Secondly, that they are here to be considered not simply as sinnes, or causes of sinnes, but as effects and punishments springing from the root of Idolatry. Thirdly, that he nameth not all the branches of iniustice to men, (see more <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19. 20. <hi>Col.</hi> 2, 8.) but the most principall and such as then reigned most amongst the Heathens. Fourthly, that though an imputation bee here laid vpon al the Heathen, who are vniuersally blamed without exception, because few among them liued ciuilly,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:20835:57"/>
and all were by nature giuen to them; yet no doubt all were not alike guilty; and further howsoeuer all these sins were not found in euery one, yet all were guilty of some one or more of them. Moreouer, he doeth accuse the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> directly to bee faulty in these transgressions, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly framing his speech vnder the persons of others, to decline enuy; letting them rather see in the mirrour of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens liues, what themselues were by nature, then plainly charging them to do such things. Lastly, there is a great difference betweene godly Christians and prophane Heathens, in respect of these vices; which howsoeuer Gods regenerate children may fall into some of them, of frailty and by strength of temptation; yet they are not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen wholy, and for euer ouer vnto any of them, nor bee full fraught with them.</p>

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:20835:58"/>
euill to them who do euill, life to the righteous, death to the sinners. This iudiciary law is called iudgement or iustice, because by the immutable order of iustice, it is requisite that rewards and paines be repaied to men as recompence of their workes. It is tearmed the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, because it doth not belong to God as a contingent effect of his free will, which he may doe, or not do as he will; but as a naturall attribute is in God, and by him vnchangeably expressed and executed, 2. <hi>Thes.</hi> 1, 6, 7. Whereas the <hi>Gentiles</hi> are saide to know this iudgement, the meaning is; that they well vnderstood the law and iudgement of God, to allot death to them which did such crimes, and that vnto such crimes death did so firmely and necessarily cleaue by Gods iudgment, as whether God did inflict, or for some time spared, yet the doers of such things were worthy of death, that is, some kind of punishment tending to destruction: euen of Hels destruction, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> were not altogether ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, as by <hi>Virgil</hi> and other Poets may be collected. This iustice of God the Heathens knew, by light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Secondly, by witnesse of their owne Conscience, and by experience in the daily examples of diuine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge. Hence <hi>Draco</hi> appointed death to the breakers of his lawes, and <hi>Gentiles</hi> iudged Adulterers vnto death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38, 24. Also the Barbarians, <hi>Acts,</hi> 28, 4, bewray murtherers worthy to dye in their iudgement.</p>

                     <p>The general purpose, is to shew the guiltinesse of the Gentiles, but especially to discouer &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue a close kinde of sinners, who tooke themselues to be righteous &amp; without fault, because they reproued others, and could not themselues
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:20835:59"/>
be blamed of the world; these sinners the Apostle tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them, that it is little helpe to them, that the world cannot iudge them, seeing they are iudged of their own Conscience, and of God. The text hath a reproofe in the first words. Secondly, a reason in the rest.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>This indeed is the commonly receined opinion, that the Apostle hauing in the latter end of the former Chapter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued and conuicted open and bold offenders, doth now in the beginning of this Chapter blame another kinde of trespassers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Gentiles, which were more polliticke, and sinned with more cuning, neither doing openly nor allowing such grosse crimes as were mentioned before, but taxing and condemning them both morally by precepts, as did <hi>Cato, Socrates, &amp;c.</hi> and ciutlly by their lawes, as <hi>Solon, Lycurgus, Draco &amp;c.</hi> Yet in secret and priuately did the same things. Some also there be which thinke that <hi>Paul</hi> hauing reprehended such as abused their contemplatine knowledge, and contrary there vnto bad run into foule Idolatry against the first Table, now taxeth such as abuse their practicke knowledge, trespassing against their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, contrary to the knowne rules of common equity; but what doe you thinke of the connexion of this Chapter with the former?</p>

                     <p>The first Particle of this Text [<hi>Therefore</hi>] doth well cleare it to me, that this whole sentence is inferred and dependeth vpon the former words in the last verse of the precedent Chapter, so as he doth not take vp a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of a new sort of sinners, but goeth on still to conuict the same transgrcssors, but with a new <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Hitherto he hath reasoned from the effect of euill workes done by the <hi>Gentiles</hi> against God and men, to wit; the wrath and punishment of God reuealed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted vpon them, whereof it followeth strongly that the Heathen by their works deseruing damnation, could not thereby challenge Iustification. Heere he argueth and concludeth the same thing from a Testimony or iudgement of euery mans owne Conscience, not from that particular morall iudgement of some learned
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:20835:60"/>
Philosophers, as <hi>Scneca, Plato, &amp;c.</hi> or that ciuil iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of certaine Law-giuers, condemning to punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, vices which themselues did; but from the vniuersall iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is in al men naturally, and bindeth all. Sithence all men doe condemn themselues, yea euen for such things as they blame in others, yet themselues do them: it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cth that euery one without all excuse, is guilty in the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of GOD, and therefore cannot be iustified by their workes.</p>
                     <p>The summe of this first verse is thus much: ye acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodge, &amp; account them which doe such euils (as before spoken off) worthy of death: yet you your selues do know that either in whole or in part, priuately or publikely ye do such thinges; therefore in your owne iudgement you are condemned whatsoeuer ye doe pretend for your excuse. <hi>Paul</hi> by an Apostrophe directeth his speech vnto one man, to shewe thereby that it is the condition and case of euery one: for there is none liuing but must approue that iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of GOD in <hi>Verse</hi> 23. and which doeth not many things against it euen by the witnesse of his owne consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The parts then of this Chapter, be principally these two. First, by a new reason he proueth that Heathen men cannot be iustified by their workes, <hi>Verse</hi> 1, 2. Secondly, hee remoueth and answereth both the generall pretences and excuses of all men, <hi>Verse</hi> 3, vnto <hi>Ver.</hi> 12. and the spcial allegations, first of the Getiles, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ve. 12. vntil 17. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of the Iewes from <hi>Ver.</hi> 17. to the end of the Chapter.</p>

The reason is, euery man doth something, which he knoweth to be euill, and to deserue Gods ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance: either he committeth some outward and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fault, for which not himselfe alone, but the worlde can censure him: or howsoeuer he so suppresse his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of wrath, enuy, reuenge, hatred, couetousnesse, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, pride, &amp;c. as they doe not breake out as pussles and botches in his face and hands, yet they boile with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and like sparkles out of a furnace, so there rise vp out of the corrupt and vncleane soule, many noysome lustes and desires, whereof they cannot be ignorant in whom they be. <hi>Socrates</hi> one of the best mannered Philosophers could say, that by nature hee was incontinent, though by Philosophy he brideled that affection from running into action. The vse of this instruction is twofold. First, it stoppeth the mouth of all Iusticiaries which seeke to establish a righteousnesse by their owne workes, as if
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:20835:61"/>
they could stand iust before God, and by their owne deeds; whereas euery man hath his owne heart to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him (and therefore, God much more to iudge him) as guilty of doing one thing amisse, or other, or many things rather. Whereas an absolute freedom from all faults is required in him who will bee pronounced righteous by his owne doings. Secondly, heere is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition for all men, but chiefly for such as haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to gouerne and iudge other, that they be verie carefull to auoide (what may be) to become selfe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demners and Iudgers, by failing in such matters, as by their place and office, they are driuen to sentence and punish in their inferiours. For it is a thing full of disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie and scandall, when a man may worthily haue it replied vnto him; <hi>Physitian heale thy selfe.</hi>

                     <p>This verse was a proof of that which was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the first verse: for there he saide, that men which condemned themselues, are without excuse; but are so
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:20835:62"/>
guilty, as they cannot escape: the reason heereof is now rendred, because the iudgement of God is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to truth; and therefore, though men would blinde themselues, putting out their owne eyes, yet that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done; and were it done, it cannot help, for God will finde them out. By iudgement is meant, both Gods gouernment of things and persons in this world, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, his iudiciary power, in inflicting paine; and also the action of the last and great day, when God will giue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence to euerie man, as his workes be.

The first is the hope of impunity, by the lenity of God, giuing good things out of his bounty or kindnesse, bearing with the abuse of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits out of his patience, and forbearing a great while to punish, out of his long sufferance; therefore say sinners, he will neuet punish.

                     <p>No verily: for the Apostle prooueth heere the quite contrary, because none can bring the workes of the Law perfect; therefore none can looke to be iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God by his workes. Again, it is not written, God will Iudge [For,] but according to our workes. Moreouer, they cannot merit, because they are not our owne. Fourthly, because they are a debt due to God, the creature oweth all to the Creator, but he is Debter to none. Lastly, there is no proportion betweene them &amp; the reward; the one being finite, the other infinite, both in time and measure: but howsoeuer good workes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee an euen rule of merit with God, as they be with men, yet they are a manifest rule of equity. For it is good reason that it go well or ill with vs, as we haue done ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good or euill.</p>

                     <p>True, because they are our owne, and bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, so be not our good workes, for they are wrought in vs by Gods Spirit, and be vnperfect.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Not so, but the quite contrary: for where there is in any an opinion of merite, there can bee no good workes done, because in such persons all thinges are done of selse-loue, with respect to their owne welfare, and not out of loue to Gods glory: and such workes as<note place="margin">Note this.</note> are done out of selfe-loue to merit withall, cannot bee good; for though the substance of the worke be good, yet the manner and end of it is naught, and thus are no good workes done in all Popery.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>There be indeede differing readings of this text: for some read it thus: To such as by continuance in wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing seeke eternall life, <hi>God shall render glory, and honour, and immortality.</hi> Others thus: to them which by patience in wel-doing, seeke glory, honour, immortality [<hi>Hee will render</hi>] eternall life; and (indeede) thus the wordes stand in the Originall, if ye vnderstand the worde [<hi>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>] out of the sixt verse, to supply the sense. But others read thus: To them which by patience seek eternal life, God [<hi>Will render</hi>] the glorie of good workes, honour, &amp; immortality.</p>
                     <p>The cause of this difference, is two-fold: First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some do ioyne the word [<hi>Render</hi>] which is supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, vnto glory, &amp;c. Others, vnto eternall life. Secondly, some do couple [<hi>good workes</hi>] with Patience or continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: others, pull it thence, &amp; put it after glory; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they are seuered one from the other, in verse 10. and so ought to be heere. Howsoeuer, for substance of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it much mattereth not, what reading wee choose, because the drift and intent of them all is one; to teach vs who they bee, to whome the rewarde of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting

life shall bee rendered; namely, to such as by patience continue in goodnesse: yet I do followe, the first reading, as carrying a plaine sense, agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the scope of <hi>Paul,</hi> though with some transpositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the words; and hauing diuers good interpreters, as guides vnto me of this my choise. The words do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine two markes of such as shall inherit eternall glorie and honour. One is, that they patiently perseuer in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good: the second is, that they seeke eternall life; this is the butte and end of their desires, not worldly things, as riches, honour, pleasure; but that life which lasteth for euer and euer, euen so long as God himselfe (who is this life) dooth last and endure: of these two markes let vs deale with the latter, though it be not first named in the Text.</p>

                     <p>By life, is meant the happinesse of the Saints in heauen, and it is called eternall, because there shall bee no end of it: also to seeke it, is to feele a want of it, and with great care to desire it, and labour to obtaine it.

                     <p>That this is the marke of a godly man, to desire and study aboue all things, how to bee saued in the day of iudgement. This indeede is the desire of the wicked, euery one hath a desire to be saued, but in diuers things their desires do differ from the desires of the godly. First the desire of the godly is constant, so is not the desire of the wicked, who desire it by fits. Secondly, the godly desires saluation, that God may be glorified in his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which comes of grace: the wicked seek their owne welfare, because they would be happy, which comes of nature. Thirdly, the wicked so desire saluation, as they do not minde the way thither, which is wel-doing, or a
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:20835:68"/>
iust and godly life: the godly in his desires, is lead as well to the way and meanes, as to the end and scope.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Then there is a necessity to do good workes, or to line well, seeing this is the way which conducteth to happinesse?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>True, there is so; because God commaundeth them, and appointed them as the course wherein his children must runne towards heauen: but these good workes cannot bee done without many difficulties and perils; and therefore, wee haue neede of patience and perseuerance, which is the second marke of him that shall be heire of heauen.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>It is the grace of God, whereby we are strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to endure troubles for wel-doing vnto the end.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It is so, and for many iust reasons: as first, that God is constant in his loue towardes vs, therefore our loue and seruice to him ought to bee constant. Second, is Christs example, who kept on his course in wel-doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, through many afflictions, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12, 2. Thirdly, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life is promised only to such as continue to the end, <hi>Math.</hi> 10, 22. Fourthly, eternall death is threatned vnto such as faint and giue ouer, before they haue run to the end. Fiftly, the wicked are constant in il-doing. Sixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly many godly persons haue abid with patience in wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doing, whose steps we must tread in, <hi>Heb. 6,</hi> 12. to these may be added Gods commandement.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, losse of goods. Secondly, danger of life. Thirdly, reuilings and slanders raised by Satan &amp; wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men. Lastly, the great labour and paines that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to wel-doing.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas</speaker>
                     <p>By considering these few, and such like things:
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:20835:69"/>
First, that it is better to loose the worlde then to loose our soules. <hi>Math.</hi> 16. 26. Secondly, that such as will loose their liues for Christs sake, shall saue it. Thirdly, that it is a blessed thing to be reuiled for righteousnesse sake. Lastly, that the paines about godlinesse will bee recompenced by the fruit which followes, and there is more labour a great deale in committing sinne, then in doing good works.</p>

                     <p>That the godly how infamous soeuer they bee in the world, yet they are glorious with God, and honourable in his sight; for they shall be placed on his right hand, and set vpon thrones. Secondly, that their glory is immortall and neuer withering. Thirdly, that their estate is full of manifolde glory, which the Apostle would teach, by the heaping of sundry words here, as if there were not words enough to expresse their happinesse: seeing therefore the end of well doing will be such, we ought with patience to abide and continue in well doing.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>For Infants which be glorified, they are saued by the free election of GOD, by grace of the couenant, and also by Christ, into whome they are ingrafted by faith, which would be fruitfull in good works, if they did liue till they were men: for true iustifying faith can neuer bee without good works, in such as for yeares and strength are apt and able to do them, no more then the Sunue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out light, or a good tree without good fruite. Touching such as bee conuerted at the eleauenth houre, in the houre and moment of death, as the Theese vpon the Crosse was, I say of them that for the time they liue after their conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:20835:69"/>
their faith will be working, for it is operatiue and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be idle, because it is liuely, and life is actiue, as was seen in that repentant Theese, whose faith brast forth by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of sinne, reprehension of his neighbour, petition to God, glorification of Christ, and Apologie for his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency: yea if such as take the life of faith, when they bee to leaue the life of nature, might bee suffered to continue in this world, they would also continue in good works. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh here of such as were of full age, and also might doe good workes being spared to liue, that by well liuing they might honour God, and bee at length for euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more honoured with him.</p>

                     <p>Scripture vsually diuideth nations into Iewes and Gentiles, or Iewes and Greekes; because the Hebrews held all people beside themselues to be Greekes, and these ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting all beside themselues to be barbarous; hence the Greekes are subdiuided into Greekes and Barbarians. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 14. 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 12. Iewes are first named be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their prerogatiue to bee Gods people: also they excelled others in the knowledge of God; and therefore were more seuerely to bee punished for their disobeying the trueth. Hence it is, that as they were first for the order and preheminence of estate; so they are first placed here in the order of punishment, for abusing so great dignity and vnderstanding. Also it is to bee obserued that heere the Apostle beginneth to wrap the Iewes in the selfe same reproofe with the Gentiles, because hee intendeth directly and more specially to reprehend them, vnto whome ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore easily by little and little hee slideth, turning his speech by name to them alone hereafter at the verse 17. When he

sayth, <hi>Behold thou art called a Iew &amp;c.</hi> And in that he wold not spare his own kindred but named them first, he shewes himselfe vnpartiall.</p>

                     <p>He confirmeth by this sentence, that which before hee saide of the equall conditiou of the Iew and Gentile, whome he had matched in punishment; whereas they see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be vnequall, for the Iew had the law of Moses (as a great light) to guide them, so had not the Gentiles, but the small and dimme light of nature: therefore it seemeth a respect of person to condemne them to equall paynes, which were not equall in the meanes to keepe them from sinning. The Apostle answereth, that howsoeuer the cause might be vnequall, yet God in distributing paine, was not moued with respect of person: hee did not looke vnto the countrey or kindred of the Iew, or of the Gentiles, when hee inflicted punishment vppon them: but notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the difference of countrey, God did alike punish the Gentiles which had no written lawe, and the Iewe which had a lawe written by Moses; because whosoeuer doeth transgresse, whither it be without a law or with a law, they are worthy of death. Hauing then hitherto from the 3. verse answered the generall pretext of all men, nowe hee bendeth himselfe to take away the more speciall excuses and shifts (as bucklers against Gods iudgements:) first of the Gentiles, vntill verse 17, and then of the Iewes to the end of the Chapter.</p>

                     <p>The outward qualities, as riches, pouerty, birth, country, friends: some of these qualities are of our own election as to be a Captaine, a Souldior, a Magistrate, a Minister. Some put vpon vs by God, as Country, birth, riches, and pouerty. The meaning then of these wordes is this, that God is not moued with any of these qualities to loue or to hate, to refuse or to receiue any to fauour, no nor yet with any guifts either naturall, as wit, memory, vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, or gotten by labour, as Learning, Arts, experience.</p>

Secondly, Gods decree was before eyther there were men or woemen, that is; before they had any being. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there must needs be a reiecting of some, where some be elected. Fourthly, that which moued him to make this

difference, was not any condition or qualities in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but his good pleasure. Fifthly, the elect are not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued but by the merits of Christ: the others are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned but by the desert of their sinnes: adde hereunto that God is not tyed vnto any law, and therefore cannot wrong any or offend against equity.</p>

                     <p>Verie many and great. First, so it is commanded<note place="margin">Iohn 13, 17.</note> in sundry places. Secondly, the end of our knowledge,<note place="margin">Iames 1, 22.</note> is practise. Thirdly, knowledge without practise, it is<note place="margin">Iohn 14, 23.</note> not only vaine, but verie hurtfull. Fourthly, if wee pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise<note place="margin">Rom. 2, 4, 5.</note> that we know, we are like to Christ and the Saints.

                     <p>To answere more distinctly the obiection which the Gentils or Iewes might make for themselues. The Iew he might obiect, that seeing he had the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> there was wrong done to him, to match him with the Gentiles, in the case of sinne and damnation. Vnto
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:20835:74"/>
which the Apostle answered; that they being breakers of the Law, could haue no benefit of saluation from the Lawe, which saueth none but the perfect keepers of it. There is a perfect keeping of the Law, either by Christ his obedience, imputed to the beleeuer: of this <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh not yet, till the third and fourth Chapters: or else, suppose any man by his owne strength could fulfill the Law, then should he thereby be iustified; of this, the Apostle heere in this place, is to be vnderstood. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, there is a double Iustification; one, in opinion, when men think and presume they be iust, as the Lawy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er did that questioned with Christ, Luke 10. &amp; the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risies, Luke 16, 15. <hi>Ye are they which iustifie your selues.</hi> The other, is in truth before God, which the Apostle mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth heere, and saith; that if any in their deedes could answere the perfection of the Law, thereby hee should be absolued and pronounced iust, euen in Gods sight, which is the true meaning of the word (Iustified) both heere and elswhere, as appeareth by the opposition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Perishing &amp; Iustifying; as also between condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Iustifying, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 33. and especially, by that place, in Acts Chapt. 13, 39. <hi>From all things from vvhich ye could not be Iustified &amp;c.</hi> where the word can haue no other sense, but [<hi>Absolued.</hi>] Note further, there is a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Iustification, and an Euangelicall. The latter, is by Christ thorough Faith: the former, by keeping the law perfectly. For the end of the Law is not knowledge, but practise to make the creature wholy conformable to the Creator, therefore it must iustifie the performer. Of this Iustification Legall, <hi>Paul</hi> now entreateth.</p>

                     <p>None saue <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency, &amp; the man Christ, all other men (without exception) break it. The reason whereof, is, because all men being borne in sin, cannot but in euery thing transgresse the Law, till they be sanctified; and after they be sanctified, they can keep the Law, but not perfectly, because their new birth is imperfect in this life, sinne still striuing against grace; whereof it followes, that none can challenge at all life eternall, by the Law or the workes thereof, as they bee done by vs.</p>

                     <p>It is true, in time &amp; pang of some grieuous temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or if the conscience be feared; also when it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleepe or benummed, it doth faile in giuing testimonie of our persons. Secondly, it doth beare witnesse of our life and actions.</p>

                     <p>What is the testimony that the Conscience giueth of mens actions?</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>Before they are done, it witnesseth &amp; admonisheth vs; or when we shal do them how good or euil they be. After they are done, it tels vs what we haue done, that is; when we are about to do or say any thing, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science telleth whether it is good or euill, whether wee please or displease God in it. Example we haue heereof in <hi>Dauid,</hi> who when hee was shut vp in the Caue with <hi>Saul, Dauids</hi> Conscience told him afore-hand, that hee should do ill to do violence to <hi>Saul,</hi> Sam. 23, 6. Also <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephs</hi> Conscience told him before hand, that hee should do ill to consent to his Mistris, Gen. 39, 9. Also <hi>Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cahs</hi> Conscience did witnesse, that it was a good worke to preserue her two sonnes, Gen. 27, 42.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Doth not the Conscience erre sometime in giuing testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony touching actions?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes it dooth, because it is defiled with ignorance and superstition. Therefore in this case the erring con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science ought to be reformed by the word, but til it be reformed, it must be followed and obeyed, as appeareth by Rom. 14, 21. 1 Cor. 8, 10.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas</speaker>
                     <p>It certifieth vs and witnesseth to vs what is done, and what is not done; the reason of this is because there is in the Conscience a power obseruing and remembring all that passeth from vs in thought, word, or deed, as may appeare by the example of <hi>Iosephs</hi> brethren, also of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and of euery mans experience.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>To excuse vs when we haue done well, whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon ariseth ioy: and to accuse vs when we haue done ill, whereupon ariseth griefe and feare; it accuseth vs in all things done against Conscience, because it striketh vs with terror and sorrow, but in honest actions which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with nature it doth excuse vs.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>What may be the meaning of that he saith, our thoughts accusing or excusing one another?</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>It is not so to be vnderstood, as though the thoughts themselues were at ciuill warre, striuing together one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another, about one and the same fact or deed: some thoughts accusing it, and on the contrary some other thoughts excusing it; nor yet it is to be applied vnto di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers persons, as that some thoughts should accuse vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers and wicked men which are to be punished; and other thoughts should excuse beleeuers and godly men who are to be saued: but it must be meant of the change and turnes which our thoughts haue in accusing or excusing our owne deeds and words, as they shall fall out to be well or ill spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or done, so our thoughts doe eyther acquit them or condemne them. And this testimony which the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of men beareth by accusing or excusing, according as the things committed are good or euill, it pleaseth God to keepe and maintaine it in euery mans heart for two speciall purposes, not onely that there might bee a constant difference betweene men and beasts, but also for to be an aid and helpe vnto men, the better to search out our Creator, to conserue humane society, to leaue the vnrighteous without all apologie and excuse in the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:20835:76"/>
day of the Lords iudgement; and namely, to take away all pretence from Pagans and such as bee without the Church, to whom their very Conscience shall be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to beare witnesse against them vnto their condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, though they neuer had either Law or Gospell.</p>

Thirdly, to be much occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied in purging and cleansing the Conscience, that it may do his Office well and kindly; this must be by often and narrow search, and vnfeigned confession and forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of knowne sinnes.</p>

                     <p>That they had the law and the seruice of God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed them by it; this benefit appeareth to bee great, by <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 7. 8.

                     <p>That the true God was their God, and made a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to take them to be his people, this was a maruailous great benefit, the profession and dignity of the couenant, as appeareth by <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 29. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 144, 15. And <hi>Paul</hi> sayeth it was their glory: but this was their abuse of this benefit, that they gloried in God without due desire and care to aduance his glory, by godlines of liuing.</p>

                     <p>It is the knowledge of Gods will; this appeareth to bee a precious benefit by these reasons.

Fourthly, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth one man to excell another: but heerein they abused their knowledge, both for that knowing the will of GOD they did it not: and also because being seuered from loue of God and their neighbour, it made them swell.</p>

                     <p>Triall of thinges which differ: these wordes, they haue another reading; as thus, Thou allowest of things which are excellent. If wee take the first reading, then it hath this sence; that the Iewes had such a degree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods will, at least in their own perswasion, as they could discerne betweene good and euill, betweene trueth and errours. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 7. 8. But if wee take the second rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, then the sence will be this; that they by their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, not onely could tell what was good and what was not, but of sundry duties they knew which was most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. This is a benefit of great moment, because in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of two duties, when they come in ballance togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it is a very good thing to know which is to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; for one may commit a great sin in the doing of good duties, if for a lesse he neglect a greater, or hinder one du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by another; as to be collecting for the poore, when they should attend the word; or to be busie in reading and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate prayer, when they should bee giuen to publike deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

Secondly, such as for their knowledge can and do teach themselues; but for lacke of vtterance they cannot instruct others. This is a fault in some Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors. Thirdly, such as haue skill to teach others, and do it in a good measure, but themselues for lacke of appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, haue no profit to amendment of their owne life: this is the fault both of euil Pastors and euill professors, and is the thing which is blamed in this text.</p>

                     <p>Theft (in a proper speech, or according to the common vse of the word) is a secret conueying from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men their goodes, without their knowledge or leaue. Of this theft there are two kindes, either it is of

                     <p>They are either holy, prophane, or common: to steale holy things it is Sacriledge, when things appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to an holy vse, are turned to a priuate vse. Also, the stealing of common or prophane things, is either by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the goods of priuate men, or else by robbing the common treasure.</p>

                     <p>It hath so, for theft importeth all wrong anie way done to others, in that which by right is due vnto them, yea, all desire of other mens substance is theft; &amp; when theft is thus taken, many other sinnes will come vnder it; as first, all withholding from others things found or committed vnto our trust, is theft. Secondly, when things borrowed are neuer paide againe, or bee worse at the returning, then when they are borrowed. Thirdly, thinges solde by false weights or measures. Fourthly, the vttering bad wares instead of good. Fiftly, the ouer-prizing of our Wares. Sixtly, the buying too cheape of such as are driuen to sell. Lastly, all fraud and deceite in bargaining. Moreouer, to keepe backe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants wages, and to faile of doing towards others that dutie which by our place we are bound to do, as in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, Magistrates, Maisters, Seruants, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>That it is a marke of an Hypocrite to abstaine from some grosse sinnes, and yet to liue in other sinnes as foule. Secondly, to do the same thinges which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly he reproueth in others. Thirdly, note that <hi>Paul</hi> ioyneth Idolatry and Sacriledge, not as opposites, but as things neere of kinne.

                     <p>This Text which saith (Circumcision is nothing to such as keepe not the Law) speaketh of impenitent transgressors, such Hypocrites as doe sinne and continue in their sinnes without any godly griefe for their falles, or confidence in the grace of Christ for remission of their faults; to these indeed Sacraments bring no benefit at all. Howbeit such as do transgresse the law by infirmity against their owne purpose and resolution, being heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorry vpon their disobedience once espied, groning with vnfeigned sighes for the offence of God thereby, and endeuouring to arise by repentance; such haue fruit by the holy Sacraments, because they stand to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:20835:85"/>
vpon which the force and benefit of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments do depend. For they keepe the Law, tho not in their owne person, yet in Christ in whom they beleeue, and for whose sake their daily slips and faults of frailty are not imputed, Christ being made to the fathfull the end of the Law for righteousnesse, <hi>Rom. 10, 4, 5.</hi> of which righteousnesse, as Circumcision to <hi>Abraham</hi> and the godly Fathers before Christ, so Baptisme &amp; the Lordes Supper since Christ his comming, be seales assuring vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the godly Beleeuers, their iustification with God by faith in Christ. Whereas to the vnfaithfull &amp; wicked li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, they are vtterly voyde and of no force, except it be to seale vp their iust condemnation, and to be a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse against them.</p>

                     <p>Let vs heare now more fully the difference betweene one that is a true Israelits, and one that is a counterfeit: by consequence of a true Christian and an Hypocrite.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>The differences are many which I wil rehearse in order. First of all, the true Israelite loues God for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. The counterfeit loues God for his benefites; the one loues the word, because it is his word, &amp; the foode of his soule; the other, because of knowledge, which
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:20835:86"/>
delighteth him, which is a natural thing. The one lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth Gods Children, because they belong to God; the other, loues them for some carnall respect, as for profit, credite, kindred. The true Israelite seeketh the praise of God, the false, praise and reputation of the worlde: the one desires chiefly to haue himselfe and his dooings approued of God, the other chiefly desireth this, that he and his workes might be seene of men. The true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian looketh as much to the manner of doing, as to the worke done, so doth not the Hypocrite, he looks to the act onely, being carelesse of affection. The one doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther desire to be, then to seeme to be; the Hypocrite is quite contrary. The one cleaueth to the Lord with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of heart: the other is wauering and vnstable. The one is led to good, or to shun euill, with regard of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour or feare; the other, that hee may please God. The one complaineth of his infirmity, rather then hee will praise his good deedes; the other, delighteth to heare of his owne good doings. The one saith little, &amp; doth much; the other doeth little, and talketh much. The one doeth cloake bad actions with good pretences, so will not the other.</p>

                     <p>First, vpon this text is grounded the distinction of the inward and outward Sacrament. Also of the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and inuisible Church.

                     <p>The Apostle stil goeth on, to proue the Iewes to be guilty thorough sinne, of Gods wrath; that whatsoeuer preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues they had on Gods part to grace them, yet because of their vnbeliefe and other transgressions, they were no more iust before God then the sinfull Gentiles, as he confirmeth by sundry authorities diuine, out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Psalmes; whereuppon hee inferreth, that by the workes of the Law, none be iustified in the sight of God; and so at last concludeth demonstratiuely the maine and principall proposition of this Epistle, that all elect sinners, bee they Iewes or Gentiles, are iustified without the workes of the Law, by the faith of Christ. Touching the generall parts of this Chapter, they bee these three. First, is a confutation of diuers cauils and calumnious Obiections, which the Iewes might mooue on their owne behalfe, out of such thinges as <hi>Paul</hi> had written, vntill verse 9. The second, from the 9. Verse, vnto the 21. wherein he both propoundeth &amp; proueth the quality both of Iew and Gentiles, in the case of sin
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:20835:87"/>
and damnation. In the third and last part, he inferreth, and by vnanswerable reasons demonstrateth this affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiue proposition [<hi>All men bee iustified by faith,</hi>] from verse 21. till the end of the Chapter.</p>

For, it were absurd and iniurious vnto God himselfe, to equall the Gentile vnto the Iew. To which the Apostle so answeareth, as leauing them equall for guilt of sinne, yet he giueth to the Iew his prerogatiue.</p>

                     <p>All the Scriptures of the Old Testament, both Moysaicall and Propheticall, but especially, the free promises of grace and saluation by Christ. These Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles were committed to the Iewes, not as another mans thing laide to pledge, but as their owne treasure to be enioyed for their vse, to instruct and comfort them, if they could haue vsed it well. Howbeit thorough their owne fault, they serued not to this end, and so they lost the right of this prerogatiue, so as it nothing profited them.</p>

Secondly, wee
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:20835:88"/>
learne that it is a signe that God maketh high account of that people to whome hee doth of trust commit his worde, which should woorke in vs great care of thankfulnesse to God, with study and an earnest desire of pleasing him. Thirdly, wee learne that the office of the Church toward the word, is to be a keeper of it, for it is of trust committed to vs as a iewell to be kept: the duty of the Church herein doeth consist in foure particulars. First, to interprete and giue the true sence of the worde. Secondly, to seuer it from all false and bastard Scriptures. Thirdly, to propound foundly the doctrine of the worde to the Children of the Church. Fourthly, to preserue the doctrine vncorrupt, and to punish such as depraue it: and herein the Iewes acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselues wel, for they safely kept the scriptures from falsity and corruption euen to this day; and in the dayes of our Sauiour, when many other faults both in manners and doctrine were laid to their charge; yet they were not char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with deprauing the word.</p>

                     <p>These words (<hi>for what though</hi>) imply this to depend and follow of the former, as thus: in the Oracles which GOD gaue his people, there passed a mutuall couenant, God on his part promising grace and life, the Iewes on their part promising faith and obedience, though they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued perfidious and disobedient: why should this derogate from the trueth of God? Whereas hee sayeth (some,) this word distinguisheth the holy and beleeuing Fathers, from the multitude of vnbeleeuers: so then albeit the greatest part were perfidious, and gaue no credite to these Oracles which God had left with them, of credite and trust, to bee both preseruers and dispensers of them: yet also there was still in that people such as were elect and faithfull, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of whome the promises were not frustrate and voyd. By (vnbeliefe) is meant here not only their not beleeuing the things promised by God in his word, but withall their rebellion in falling from God and his true worship, vnto I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dols and vanities: and by (faith) vnderstand the fidelity of God, or his constancy in keeping his word and promises, as the Heathen Oratour hath described faith to bee a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy and truth, in obseruing sayings and couenants: and herewith agreeth the notation of the word <hi>(fides) quia fit quod dictum est.</hi> For this faith to bee of none effect, is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as to bee voide and vnsulfilled; as who should say, shall God be held vnconstant and spoyled of his truth, for the infidelity and perfidiousnesse of men? This introgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath the force of a negation, it is as if he saide: No, it is not so, because whiles many were vnbeleeuers, yet not a few there were to whome God fulfilled his faith and truth, euen to so many as brought with them the condition of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience.</p>

                     <p>Diuers Lessons: First this speech [<hi>God forbid,</hi>] it being a word of detestation, to shew how hee doth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre the thing obiected, shold not be vsed in vain and childish matters (as most commonly it is) but in graue and serious businesse, and when the heart is affected. Secondly, the vnbeleefe of men cannot frustrate &amp; make voyde Gods promises, because howsoeuer some remain vnbeleeuers, yet others which do beleeue, they feele the effects of Gods promises?</p>

                     <p>Two things, first that the blindnes and contumacy of some hearers, must not discourage the ministers in their function. Secondly, that the people shoulde not refraine from holy things for the wickeds sake; because there will alwayes be such, as to whome Gods word and ordinances will bee offered in vaine: yet they shall not goe without a blessing to the humble and contrite sinners.</p>

the truth of God by the authority of Scripture, which he fetched from Psalme 51, 4, 5.</p>

                     <p>By the contrary, that is; by the vanity and false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of men who are lyars. Secondly, by the authority of Scripture, out of the Psalm 51, (<hi>As it is written.</hi>)</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>First, because he is most faithfull in his word. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, being the Author of all truth in his Creatures. Thirdly, infinitely hating all lyes and falshood in others.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Yea, but the good Angels are also endued with truth, and so are righteous men.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It is so, but God is true essentially, immutably, most perfectly, and infinitely: which truth he doth make appeare first in his promises of mercies: Secondly, in his threatnings of iudgements. Gods promises be true in a three-fold respect. First, of God who cannot lie. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of themselues, being al infallible truths. Thirdly, of the beleeuers, who obtaine them.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Yet he hath promised sundry mercies which he did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer performe, and threatned many iudgements which neuer came to passe.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Some of Gods promises are of things absolutely necessary to Saluation, these are most firme, as forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sinnes, the Holy Ghost, &amp;c. Some of his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are belonging to the well-fare of this life; as health, liberty, prosperity, these are made with exception of the Crosse, and vnder condition of obedience. As for his threatnings which haue not taken place, as to <hi>Eezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Ionas</hi> against <hi>Nineue,</hi> they are made with exception of repentance, either expressed or vnderstood, which being performed the euill was thereby remoued; as God purposed and meant, so declared and manifested by the euent.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>Sundry things: First, we must endeuour to bee like vnto God in this property of his truth, being true as he
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:20835:91"/>
is true. Truth is a part of his Image, which wee must beare and expresse in our liues. Secondly, the truth of God is a good ground of our hope, that his promises shall be accomplished vnto vs, whatsoeuer tentations happen, yet we may still trust. Thirdly, when we heare Gods promises and his threatnings, wee must assure our selues that they will come to passe in their time, because hee is true who pronounceth them, who cannot deceiue nor be deceiued. Fourthly, it reproueth two sorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, the one sort which say they doe beleeue the promises, and yet feare not at all his threatnings; the other which doubt of his promises, yet beleeue his threatnings, it being the same true God who is Author of both.</p>

                     <p>In what sence is it said that all men are lyars?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>That naturally as they are men, and vnregenerate by the spirit, they are lyars, not onely for the most part, but one and all. Secondly, men that are regenerate, are stil sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to lying, and doe sometimes fall into that sinne, as did <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Rebacca</hi> with her son <hi>Iacob.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>In what doeth it appeare, that all men naturally are lyars?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>First, in their inconstancy and often change of their purposes. Secondly, in speaking otherwise then they thinke. Thirdly, in doing towards men otherwise then they speake and promise. Fourthly, in breaking vowes and Couenants made to God. Lastly, in broaching of lyes in Doctrine, and in an aptnesse to receiue them, being prone to errors by corruption, as the water to run downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <p>What vse was made of this point?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>That no lye may be spoken vpon any pretence though it doe no harme, yea though it doe good, because it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Gods nature, and no euill is to be done that good may come of it. Secondly, that all men must mistrust themselues and keepe watch ouer themselues, being ready to slip into this vanity of lying. Thirdly, that we be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to see and confesse this our infirmity, and that prayer be made to God to change vs and deliuer vs from deceite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:20835:91"/>
hearts and lying tongues, saying, Lord correct our ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hearts, and direct vs in truth. Fourthly, that all men ought to be humbled for their failing in this fault, and craue pardon of God through Christ: for as none can say he is free from lies, so God is ready to pardon repentant persons.</p>

                     <p>What is the Sum of this Scripture, which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle fetcheth out of the 51. Psalme?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That God wil be knowne to be iust both in his words and doings, whatsoeuer men do deeme and iudge of him.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>What Sayings doth hee meane, whether his words of wrath and rebuke, or his words of promise &amp; mercy?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>Though God be most true, both in seuere threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and sweete promises; yet there hee meaneth the word of promise; and this made the Prophet to breake out into the commendation of Gods truth, euen the consideration of his owne falshood, and perfidious dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with God in his grosse sinnes, being compared with the mercy and faithfulnesse of God, in pardoning such a treacherous wretch, according to his promise. This also made the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> to confesse so frankely his crimes against himselfe, euen to this verie end, that hee might the better manifest the exceeding constancie of God, who instead of destroying him for his foule fault, did pardon and forgiue his sinne for his promise sake. And note that to be iustified here, can signifie no other, then to be accounted iust, or absolued from iniustice, &amp; not to infuse the habite of Iustice.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Very well; for if the perfidie and vnbeleefe of men do serue for the better declaration of his truth, in forgiuing their iniquities (as in this example of <hi>Dauid,</hi>) then it is certaine which the Apostle faith; That mans vnbeleefe doth not make the truth of God to be voide: which remaineth true, notwithstanding men bee Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Now ye haue expounded the words, tel what be the parts of this sentence?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Two: First, that God is iust or true in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises. Secondly, that he is iust in his corrections: true, because he truly inflicteth threatned euils, though he be patient: iust, because he inflicteth due paine.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>What learned we out of this former part?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas</speaker>
                     <p>That the sinnes which the elect fall into, though they deserue destruction, yet they serue to set forth and declare how mercifull and true God is in his couenant. For as in the dayes of Christ, many fell into sundry strange diseases, not onely or chiefly for their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that he might haue occasion to shew forth his power; so in all times some fall into grosse sinnes, to the end, God may haue occasion to shew and vtter vnto his greater glory and praise, his constant loue and truth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his. Euen as a kinde and wise father, also a good and godly Prince, make their clemencies the more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, by pardoning some grieuous faults of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects or Children. Example heereof, wee haue in <hi>Paul,</hi> whose blasphemy ministred vnto God occasion to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse his vnspeakable long suffering and kindnesse, 1. Tim. 1, 12. God would leaue <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and many others to fall, not to kill them, but to make his grace more illustrious.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>Sundry things. First, this let vs see the wonderful wisedome of God, who makes vs to know that hee can draw good out of euill. Secondly, it must serue to keepe such from despaire of pardon, as haue offended most greeuously. Thirdly it should make men warie how they easily offend such a gracious God.</p>

                     <p>In the other part of this sentence the wordt of Paul disagree from the words of Dauid, who speakes thus, that thou maist be pure when thou iudgest: reconcile them.</p>

                     <p>They disagree in shew, but not in sense; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause if God bee pure in all his corrections of men for sinne, it must needs follow that he will ouercome, and haue the vpper hand, whensoeuer me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> presume to iudge or censure him and his doings.</p>

                     <p>That the chastisement of sinners is most iust, whatsoeuer men thinke or speake. The reason whereof is, because God (being Iudge) can do no wrong. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, because he correcteth not without a iust cause. Thirdly, his corrections are euer lesse then mens faults.

                     <p>It is contained in these words: If our vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse do commend the righteousnesse of God, what
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:20835:93"/>
shal we say then? is God vnrighteous which punisheth? This obiection hath two parts, to wit; an antecedent, and a consequent. The antecedent was this; If our vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse doth commend Gods righteousnes; (this was <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine before) vpon which antecedent was gathered this consequent (by some cauillers) that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is vniust if he punish vs (this was their owne.)</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>It is thus: If mans vnrighteousnes do commend and aduance Gods righteousnesse, then God if hee pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish our sinnes, shall shew himselfe vniust to punish vs, for that thereby his glory is encreased: but it appeareth in the former example of <hi>Dauid,</hi> that Gods righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is made more commendable by mans sinne, in that for his promise sake, hee would pardon and saue him whom he might iustly haue destroyed: therefore God is vniust if hee punish. This is the whole Obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

                     <p>Now that ye haue laide forth the Obiection, tell vs the meaning of the words: and first, what is meant by vnrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse.</p>

                     <p>That which before in the third verse hee called vnbeleefe, and in the 7. verse a Lye.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Wherefore is vnbeleefe called vnrighteousnesse?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>For two causes: First, because vnbeleefe doth rob God of the glory of his truth, power, and mercie; as if hee meant not to keepe promise, or could not, or would not, which is a very vnrighteous part towardes God. Secondly, because vnbeleefe is the spring &amp; roote of all vnrighteousnesse and sinnes which bee in the world; as Faith is the roote of all duties and vertues.</p>

                     <p>That as we loath iniustice, and would not deale vnrighteously, so we should abhorre vnbeleefe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist presently and mightily all motions of it, because euery doubting thought, is a wrong and Iniustice vnto God.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Because it is a iust thing with God to keep his word, 1 Iohn 1, 7. a principall part of righteousnesse to fulfill his promise.</p>

                     <p>It is put heere not onely for practise, but for confirming or establishing, as afterward in the fift chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, God commendeth his loue, that is; confirmeth his loue.</p>

                     <p>This is not in the Nature of vnbeleefe, which in it selfe properly doth obscure Gods glory, rather then confirme it: but Accidentally, as the vprightnesse of a<note place="margin">Sins not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, that the truth is often wrested to a wrong end by corrupt minded men, who of true premisses gather false conclusions: which being done to <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:20835:94"/>
no maruaile if the like bee offered to other Ministers. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it is the nature of wicked men, to promise to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues freedome of punishment for their sinne: they would be glad after sinne to go scot-free, because they would sin more boldely. Thirdly it is a signe of a great degree in wickednesse, when men had rather haue God charged for vniust, then themselues to be found culpable.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>Because it proceedeth from God, being wrathfull and angry with sin.</p>

                     <p>That all punishments bee so many tokens of Gods wrath. Secondly, that sinne is to be auoyded as a fearefull thing, seeing it doth prouoke God to wrath, whose wrath is more heauy then any mountaine.</p>

                     <p>An argument to proue his deniall, taken from the proper office of GOD; which is, to bee iudge of all the world.

                     <p>In two things, first in the gouernment of the world which hee ruleth with great equity. Secondly, in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the last day, when as supreme iudge he shall ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to euery man according to his works.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>First, whatsoeuer punishment is inflicted vpon sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, either here in this world or in the world to come, it is most iust because the iudge (who is iustice it selfe) doth it.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>First, this serues to stoppe the mouth of all wicked men; for howsoeuer they may be discontent and murmure, yet God can doe no iniurie to any. Secondly, to teach Gods children contentment and patience in all aduersities which befall them, sithence they proceede from a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous iudge. Thirdly, it admonisheth all men in all places, at all times to liue godlily and honestly, because they are euer in the eie of their iudge; now hee must bee impudent and desperate, which will offend before the iudge. Lastly, it instructeth all iudges and rulers, and whosoeuer haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kind of power and authority ouer others, to follow this great iudge of the world in doing iustly, whatsoeuer they do to their inferiours by way of correction or reward. For following him as their patterne, they are sure to haue and finde him for their patron and shield in the euill day, when most need is of his fauour and help.</p>

First, out of the Mercy-seate were the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles giuen, so by Christ we are shewed the Oracles of the will of God, as touching our saluation. Secondly, God was saide to dwell at the propitiatory: so in Christ the whole fulnesse of the Godhead dwelleth corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Col. 2, 9. Thirdly, there God was made fauourable to the people: so is God by Christ alwayes pacified and reconciled to vs, Col. 1, 18.</p>

                     <p>Seeing that God in reconciling the world vnto him by his Sonne, did secke his owne glorie, that is the marke which we our selues are to ayme at in seeking our saluation, not seeking so much to be saued, which may come of selfe-loue, as that in our saluation, God may haue his glory.</p>

                     <p>True, it may be called the righteousnesse of God, because the person was God which wrought it, &amp; that is the onely righteousnesse which God doth allow; and by which wee are acceptable.

                     <p>It is a conclusion of the former dispute, touching iustification by faith, and hath three new reasons to proue the same. First, iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is by faith, because by that way God is most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. Secondly, if we were iustified by works of the law, it might be thought that God were God of the Iewes on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but the Gentiles which beleeued, and had not the lawe of Moses, haue God for their God; therefore it is by faith.

Lastly, iustification by faith, doth much ratifie and greatly confirme the law; therefore it is by faith that wee are iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified.</p>

                     <p>What then is it to iustifie Circumcision of Faith?</p>

                     <p>First, a Iew is not iustified, because he is such a one, that is, one circumcised according to the Law, but because he beleeueth in Christ.</p>

                     <p>That a Gentile is not cast off, because he is such, that is, vncircumcised; but hauing faith to beleeue in Christ, God iustifieth him also.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That Iew and Gentile which beleeue haue one God, a common God and Sauiour to them both. For, God is God and Sauiour to euerie one whom hee Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifyeth.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Namely thus: that seeing the Iew, which had the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> had God his God to iustifie him (not for the works of the Law which he had done) but through Faith in Christ; and also the Gentile lacking that Law, yet by faith laying hold on Christ, was admitted to the Couenant, to be one of Gods people, &amp; to haue God his God to giue him righteousnesse, thence it followes, that Iustification is not by workes but by Faith, both to Iew and Gentile.</p>

                     <p>If such as beleeue in Christ, be iustified without respect to their doing the workes of the Law, then the Law is made voide and of none effect. This obiection proceedeth from the ignorance of such as do not know the strength of sinne, the Nature of Gods Iustice, &amp; the true end wherefore the Law was giuen.

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That the truth hath no greater enemies, then proud ignorance, or ignorant pride, that dare lift vp it selfe Gyant-like against God himselfe.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <p>That all thoughts and reasonings against Gods truth, should be very detestable to vs: so as wee should reiect them with a meruailous hating of them. For, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine truth is such an holy thing, so precious to God, as

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Thus; Iustification by faith, is so farre from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying the law, as that the law is thereby established.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>

Secondly, that he suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in his death the full punishment due to the breach of the law, for all them who are iustified by him. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Also without Faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to keep the law, or anie part there of.</note> that such as beleeue in him, must endeuour the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of the Law, to declare their thankefulnesse.

                     <p>How <hi>Abraham</hi> was iustified, namely, by beleeuing the promise.

Secondly, <hi>Abraham</hi> in his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity foresaw Christ, who was to come out of his loines. Thirdly, in all promises, the promise offering Christ was wrapt, as the foundation and roote of them all. Fourthly, it was Christ which spake to him at that time, Gen. 15, 6. for it was the second person who spake vnto

                     <p>Very many and substantiall: as first, because of Gods commandement. Secondly, because God being most true, is worthy to be beleeued. Thirdly, there is great danger if wee doe not beleeue, euen eternall death, and the losse of heauen, besides all temporall goods. Fourthly, it is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall seruice of God to trust in him. Fiftly, it is the cause of all other duties, which spring from faith, as the roote of all. Sixtly, therein is God most honored, when he is trasted in; and by the contrary, much dishonoured, for hee is thereby made a liar, so much as lyeth in vs. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 20.</p>

                     <p>To proue iustification came not by woorkes, but of faith, by an argument of contraries; three contraries set against three: as first, he that worketh not, and hee that worketh.

                     <p>Free forgiuenesse of sinnes through faith in Iesus Christ; which is expressed heere by three phrases or fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of speech.

                     <p>That it was a great honour which God did vnto Abraham, to make all beleeuers his Children: First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a large and honourable posterity. Secondly, it is also a maruellous great matter to haue Abraham to be our father. For righteousnesse, forgiuenesse of sinne, &amp; all happinesse belongeth to such. We are heere verie di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently to obserue (least we erre) that father-hoode in respect of the faithful is heere giuen to Abraham not by efficiencie, as if he should be the worker and authour of faith in all his children (for faith is the guift of God, it is not of our selues, or of any other creature) but by a kind of proportion, because the grace of the Couenant was giuen him vpon that condition and agreement, and by that Lawe, that as carnall parents do passe ouer and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue all their inheritances and goods vnto their naturall
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:20835:121"/>
Children: so <hi>Abraham</hi> this spirituall Father, should by couenant, doctrine, and example, deriue vnto all the faithfull his spirituall Children, that free blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and Iustice of Faith, which hee had receiued of God. Learne also the vnity and harmony of the Church, Faith, righteousnesse in the olde and new Testaments. There is but one Father of all the beleeuers: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore but one faith, one body, and one Church: one Lord, head, and Sauiour; one Iustification, one saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, euen as we professe one catholick Church, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints, to which pertaines remission of sins, resurrection, and glory. Hence fals to ground that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall conceite of the Iewish Church, that it had onely temporall promises, and were not partakers of Christ and his righteousnes. Furthermore note here, that to be the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and heires of his Iustice, wee ought to labour for such a faith in all points as was his Faith, so qualified as his beleefe was: comming after him in beleeuing, as we would tracke and followe the steps of one which had gone before vs in a rough, vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and cragged way.</p>

                     <p>Sundry and excellent: First readinesse, in that he beleeued God without delay or deliberation, after once he had his promise and vnderstood it. Secondly sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in that he beleeued truly without Hypocrisie Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly strength, for that he stroue against, and ouercame all lets of his faith. Fourthly patience, in that hee waited long for the performance of the promise. Fiftly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy, in that he continued to beleeue vnto the end. 6. Wisedom in that he grounded his faith aright, vpon the word and promise of God, and not vppon men or his owne merites. Seauenthly fruitfulnesse, for his faith was fruitfull of good workes, Iames 2, 22. <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith wrought with his workes. Lastly, it was not coniectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral opinion, but a Plerophory or firme and full assurance of the promise, Rom. 4.</p>

                     <p>To prooue by a newe reason, that <hi>Abraham</hi> had righteousnes, not by his workes but by his faith: the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is this; By what meanes <hi>Abraham</hi> was heire of eternall life by the same meanes he obtained righteousness but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> was heire of eternal life, by beleeuing the promise, therefore also he had righteousnes by beleeuing.</p>
                     <p>Thus most commonly the purpose and connexion of this text is laide downe by interpreters: But <hi>Maister Beza</hi> and <hi>Paraeus</hi> wil haue it not a new argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to proue the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall thing in question, viz, that righteousnesse is by faith, (for this is not the thing concluded, but the <hi>medius termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> or reason to inferre a conclusion premised in verse 12. that the children of <hi>Abraham</hi> are they onely which walke in the steppes of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, (not they which walke in the steppes of his circumcision or works:) for the lawe,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:20835:122"/>
viz. (workes of the lawe naturall or written) is nothing to this child-ship (as I may speak:) reason is because the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise giuen to <hi>Abraham</hi> to bee heire of the worlde, or to haue the world his inheritance, came to him by the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of faith: therefore they which walke not in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> workes, but in his faith be his children; as <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> became their father, not by his working, but by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing: If this sence and coherence be iudged best, then by world, the beleeuers dispersed and scattered ouer the worlde is meant: also there is an <hi>Ellipsis</hi> of the worde (giuen) which should bee added to promise; and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle disiunctiue (or) hath couched in it a close obiection; as thus: Be it that the promise of being father of many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and heire of the world, were giuen to <hi>Abraham,</hi> on condition of his beleeuing, yet to his seed it might be on condition of workes: no, saith <hi>Paul,</hi> in no wise; the reason is rendred in the next verse, because so the promise of the inheritance and faith should be void and of no effect.</p>

This is proued by a reason taken from absurdities, or from contraries, which is thus; That if the inheritance be got by fulfilling the law, then faith is void, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of none effect: or more plainly thus, If saluation bee giuen on condition of woorking or doing, then it must needs be that faith which beleeues the promise is idle, and so the promise is also idle and frustrate; which were an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd thing either to thinke or speake so, for God neither doth or promiseth ought in vaine.</p>

First, because God doeth nothing in vaine.

                     <p>There is a difference to bee put betweene the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of the law and of the Gospel; for the promises of the Gospell bee of remission of sinnes, iustification, the holy Ghost, saluation: these are not made to the lawe (that is,) on this condition to keepe the law perfectly, or else not to haue them, because then these promises should bee voyde, seeing none fulfil the law, and so we should euer be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>

                     <p>It is taken from an euident effect of the law through our default, not of the law it selfe, as thus; the law accuseth vs and pronounceth vs guilty of wrath, that is, of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: therefore remission of sinnes and saluation, is not from the law; for we cannot be saued by that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth vs; and punishment is repugnant to the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and promise.</p>

Secondly, it reprooueth ignorant Christians, who attribute saluation to their good deedes and seruing of God. Thirdly, it teacheth the true bounds and limits of the law, that it was not giuen to iustifie, and therefore that we should not leane to the law for saluation: but hauing learned and beene made to feele by it, that we are vnder wrath thereby to be driuen vnto Christ our peace-maker, as the sence and smart of our wounds sends vs to the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgeon.</p>

                     <p>To proue the former point, that the promise of heauenly inheritance is ours by beleeuing, and not by woorking; the reasons to proue this, are two. First, if the promise bee made vpon any other condition then beleeuing, then it is not free but of debt. Secondly, the promise is not sure, except it bee ours by beleeuing: for there can be no certainty by workes of the law, which we be not able to do perfectly.</p>

                     <p>We may vnderstand by Grace, either the obiect of Faith, that is, Gods grace and mercie offered vnto vs in Christ, which is the very thing that faith looketh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and leaneth vpon, as the marke and stay of it: or by grace may bee vnderstoode the scope and end of Faith, which is the glory of Gods grace and fauour: for, it is much to the praise of Gods grace, to forgiue sinners, which beleeue in Christ, without all consideration of merits.</p>

                     <p>These three things: First, that to attaine a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by Faith, and to attaine it freely is all one; Faith &amp; grace being so knit, as one put the other is put, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarywise. Secondly, that it is a Doctrine that tendeth directly to the glory of Gods grace, to teach, that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse and life commeth by Faith. Thirdly, that such as will haue heauen by merit of workes, are enemies to Gods grace, whatsoeuer pretence they haue to cloake their wickednesse, yet he puls downe grace, who buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth merit.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, that there is a mutual relation or reference betweene the promise and faith, that is to say; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is made, that men should by faith lay holde on it; and faith on the other side, taketh to nothing but the promise. Secondly, we learne, that Faith maketh belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers sure of their saluation, because it leaneth vppon a
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:20835:125"/>
sure and firme promise: for it is the nature of faith to be sure and certaine, yet it is the more firme and certaine, because the promise which it beleeueth, is firm and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, like to God the promiser.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>No, because of mans weaknesse which cannot keepe it: as also, because of the Gentiles, which were not subiect to the Law and Ceremonies: and therefore could not haue enioyed the promise of life, if it had bin by the Law.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Yea, two things: First, doubt of perseuerance to the end, which satan and the flesh do suggest to the godly. This hinderance may be remoued first by praier, which beeing made from faith for the guift of perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, it obtaineth it. Secondly, by the Meditation of Gods eternall loue and couenant, that he will bee our God for euer, ler. 31. 3, 32. 40. and of Christes interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which keepeth the beleeuers from salling away, Ioh 17. The 2. hinderance is our manifold and great sins. This hinderance may be remoued, by considering, that none can be without sinnes, and that the best men haue foule ones, who yet lost not the certainty and holde of the promise thereby, because vppon repentance, they were sorgiuen for Christ his sake.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>But will not this certainty of Faith breede in vs car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall security?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>No, especially if these cautions be obserued. First, that we ground our certainty out of our selues, vpon the infallible promise of God. Secondly, our certainty must be ioyned with feare of offending God, as it is written, <hi>Be not high minded but feare, Rom.</hi> 11, 20. Thirdly, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous sinnes are to be auoided, Psal. 19, 13. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it may not be applied to licentiousnesse. I astly, wee are not to bee ignorant, that it is neuer seuered from some doubting, which is moderated and ouercome by a
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:20835:125"/>
true and liuely Faith.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>How can our Faith be certaine, and yet be moued to doubting?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, for these come of diuers grounds; certainty of faith springeth from the nature of faith, and from the truth and power of the promiser, Rom. 4, 20. but doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting commeth from the weakenesse of faith, as shaking commeth from the palsy, not from the hand.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, it administreth a maruailous great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to such as haue obtained grace to beleeue truly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though weakly, for they bee without hazard of perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and certaine to haue saluation. Secondly, an admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to labour hard for faith, and to preserue it when we haue it. Lastly, that the Papists must needs doubt of their saluation and be fearfull, seeing they will haue the promise of life eternall fulfilled vnto them, vppon the merit of their workes, and not on their faith only. For they are alwayes doubtfull whether they haue merited sufficiently, they know not when they haue done works enough: yea, in their Tridentine Councell, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend no other faith but coniecturall, euen a bare opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and haesitation; condemning ful assurance or certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of faith, for impious presumption, allowing not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of grace, without a speciall reuelation from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>

This of quickning the dead may be stretched further, euen to the particular raysing of some who were naturally dead, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> and others, as also to the generall resurrection of the dead at the last day, in both which respects God doth quicken the dead: also the Saints while they liued, haue had often experience of this effect of Gods power; namely, that being often (as it were) dead in their owne opinions by greate sicknesse
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:20835:127"/>

                     <p>To extoll and praise <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith by two reasons: First, that it did not giue place to sence, nature, or humaine reason. For he beleeued aboue the hope of man. Secondly, that it did embrace the truth of Gods promise, contained in these words; <hi>So shal thy seed be.</hi> And thirdly, that he made the Diuine promise, the support and prop of his Faith (according to that was spoken.)</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>What is meant when he saith [He beleeued vnder hope aboue hope?]</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>That he beleeued vnder the hope of God, &amp; aboue the hope of man: for when things were dosperate in the reason of man, and there was no hope at al, yet looking vp vnto God, he had hope; he conceiued inuincible faith in his heart, ioyned with an infallible hope euen against hope of flesh, nature, and all mans reason.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>It is true, &amp; then the meaning is contrary to that which might by man haue beene hoped for, hee waited for things which were set forth of God to be hoped for; ouercomming by his faith, all difficulties, absurdities, &amp; impossibilities, which natural reason might obiect and oppose to him.</p>

                     <p>This, that a true faith dooth enable vs to expect such things as the reason of man would neuer look for. Example heereof we haue in <hi>Abraham,</hi> who beeing an hundred yeare old, it was against reason, that he should
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:20835:128"/>
looke to bee a Father, yet his faith beleeued it (seeing God promised it.) Also <hi>Dauid</hi> against all humaine rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and hope beleeued, that he should be King of <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el.</hi> Also, when <hi>Moyses</hi> beleeued, that the people should passe through the Red sea as on dry Land, it was against reason: the like is to bee saide of <hi>Ioseph</hi> and of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Is it not dangerous in things which are set forth to be beleeued, to take counsell with the wisedom of the Flesh, or with humaine reason?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It is so, as appeareth in the example of <hi>Sara,</hi> of <hi>Zachary,</hi> and <hi>Moyses;</hi> all which were punished, because they consulted with flesh and bloud instead of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing. Also, in the example of wicked men, who haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued hurt by leaning too much to the wisedom of the flesh, more then to the word of God, as they which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in the wildernes: also a Prince which was seruant to <hi>Iehoram</hi> King of <hi>Israel,</hi> 2 Kings 7. Lastly, <hi>Zedekiah</hi> K. of <hi>Iudah,</hi> Ier. 39, 7. Therefore in things which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the word to be beleeued of vs, we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that which our owne and other mens reason can obiect, seeme it neuer so absurde and vnpossible which God promiseth, yet it must absolutely be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That it is the propertie of a true faith, to keepe men in hope, euen when things seeme desperate. Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple heereof we haue in our Sauiour Christ, Math 27. <hi>My God my God, why hast thou forsaken mee.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Act 27. &amp; <hi>Iob</hi> &amp; <hi>Ieremy.</hi> For faith doth beare it selfe bold vpon the truth of Gods promises. For faith doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the whole word of God, according as is written, <hi>Faith is by hearing, and hearing by the word of God,</hi> Rom. 10, 17. But the word of promise is that whereabout Faith is properly occupied, and especially the word of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, wherein God promised to bee mercifull to our sinnes.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Yet the promise that Abraham is saide to beleeue, was of a temporal blessing, euen of a large posterity.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It was so, but this dependeth vpon the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace, and helpeth him to beleeue that. For, he that can beleeue God to be faithfull in smaller thinges, can also beleeue that he will keepe his truth in greater thinges. Againe, all earthly pronuses are fulfilled for Christ, who is the substance of the Couenant. Againe, all earthly promises proceede from mercy, and Christ is the foundation of Gods mercy towards vs.</p>

Vnbeleefe if it bee a meere absence of faith, then it breedeth that wauering, where of <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh, <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. 7. if it be but a defect of beleese, then it engendreth doubting such as is here spoken off.</p>

                     <p>Yes, on euery side doubting offered it selfe, but when hee looked to the will and power of God, hee was certaine of the promises and subdued doubts arising; for it is impossible that any man should so beleeue as to bee freed from all doubting; because euery mans faith hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities in it.</p>

                     <p>It was not a little and weake faith, but a strong and great faith, such a faith as fully assured him of the thing promised to him. This word, full assurance, is fetched from shippes, which against winde and waues, are yet with full and strong saile carried vnto the hauen: so <hi>Abraham</hi> by the strength of his faith, ouercame al waues of doubts bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting against his minde.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>That in euery true faith there is an assurance and perswasion of that which it beleeuth, but not a full assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, for this is proper to a strong faith. Secondly, that weake Christians should not be discouraged, because they be not fully assured, so as they striue towards it: for the mea sure of true faith is differing, and God lookes not to the quantity, but to the trueth of faith.</p>

                     <p>Together with the conclusion of this Chapter, it doeth conclude the treatise of <hi>Abrahams</hi> iustification.

(<hi>and therefore.</hi>) Secondly, an application of <hi>Abrahams</hi> example to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing Romaynes, and to all beleeuers, verse 24. as tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching a doctrine common to the whole Church. Thirdly, a proofe of the fitnes of this application, from the end and drift of this Scripture, verse 23. <hi>(now it is not written.)</hi> Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a declaration of iustifying faith, by the twoe speciall things on which it principally leaneth, <hi>(the death and resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of our Lord.)</hi>

                     <p>Thus much; that it is no maruell if the faith of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> were imputed to him for righteousnesse, seeing by it hee did so strongly and liuely apprehend the mercies and promises which the strong and faithfull God gaue him.</p>

                     <p>We may not then thinke by the Apostles words (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) that he meant to make faith a meritorious cause of Abra hams righteousnes.</p>

                     <p>No surely, his purpose is to declare, not what his faith merited, but that it was a true, liuely, and sound faith, seeing it did so firmely lay hold on the trueth and the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of God, promising to <hi>Abraham</hi> eternall blessednesse in the person of the Messiah.</p>

                     <p>May not a weake Beleeuer by this be moued to thinke that he is not reckoned iust, seeing hee cannot so strongly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue<note place="margin">Faith is but a condition or Organ of righteousnes, not a meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting cause.</note> as Abraham did?</p>

                     <p>No such matter: For this Text applyeth Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams example not vnto strong beleeuers, but vnto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers. For whosoeuer beleeueth truly though weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:20835:130"/>
yet that weake faith (being true) shall iustifie them. For Faith iustifieth not as a quality, or in respect of the quantity and measure, but by the vertue of the obiect.</p>

                     <p>No such thing; it was not imputed to Abraham till he had faith. Likewise, it is reckoned to his children on this condition, so as they beleeue, or at that time when they shall beleeue. Faith and imputation of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse go together in order of time, though not in order of Nature, for so faith as a cause goeth before.</p>

                     <p>Abraham beleeued and was reckoned righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: likewise all Abrahams Children are iustified by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing the promise. For no otherwise are the Children to be iust, then was the Father, who by an inheritable right conueyeth to them, the Iustice imputed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>

                     <p>The scope and end of the Scripture which ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med not at Abraham only, when it is written (he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and it was imputed to him for righteousnesse) but had respect heerein to all that should beleeue as Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham did. This may appeare by the fifteenth Chapter of this Epistle, verse 4. that the things which are written of some one, do concerne all. Also <hi>Paul</hi> saith so much in effect in this place, That that which was written of one Abraham, did belong to all the faithfull.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>But how will this hold in other things which are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten both of Abraham &amp; others which no man may draw vnto himselfe for imitation, as <hi>Abrahams</hi> sacrificing of his son, and lying with his handmaide, and many such like things? and if it hold not in these things, how then doth Paul with any strength of reason gather in this poynt of Iustifying by Faith, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to vs, which was written of <hi>Abraham?</hi>
                     </p>

                     <speaker>Silar.</speaker>
                     <p>The answere is this: Some things which are written of Abraham and other of the Saints, are perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:20835:131"/>
or singular which either were their infirmities, or such things as they did by a singular calling, as <hi>Elias</hi> his praying for fireto fall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> heauen: and some other thinges are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of them, which they did by vertue of an vniuersall voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are common to them with all others. These we may distinguish after this manner: Such things as they did besides or contrary to the lawe of God, these are singular and personall, and herein wee must not imitate them; but such thinges as were agreeable to the law, or the generall commandements of God, they belong to the generall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of all Gods people, and in them wee are to followe them; as for the other, we are not to read or think of those singular thinges without fruite, for the whole Scripture is profitable: howsoeuer wee may not become followers of them therein, yet there is of euery Scripture a profitable vse perpetuall to all times.</p>

                     <p>Sundry things: first, the sauing vse of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is proper to the faithfull, for whose good alone they were written; a speciallmercy. Scondly, that diuine trueth must bee prooued by diuine Scripture, and not by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine writers, which are of no authority in matters of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Thirdly, examples serue very well to declare doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and commaundements, because to thinges hard and doubtfull, they bring great light and cleerenesse, for that in them the minde and sences both are ioyned together. Fourthly, we learne that it is a great comfort to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to bee made equall to <hi>Abraham</hi> in iustification. To Iusticiaries, mercenarie hypocrites, infidels, and prophane vnbeleeuing worldlings, it hath no comfort.</p>

                     <p>To lay forth the two principall thinges, whereunto faith leaneth, to witte; the death and resurrection of our Lord. For Christ dead and raysed againe, is the thing which a true faith chiefly looketh vnto because there it is that faith findeth matter of support &amp; stay to itselfe. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:20835:131"/>
the Apostle doth ioyne his death and resurrection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither:<note place="margin">God manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in the death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of Christ, is the euen or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual obiect of true faith, which is so carried to God, as it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth Christ the re deemer, and confidently resteth on him dead and raysed.</note> because neither his death without his life, nor his life without his death, could any whit auaile vs to Saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Hence are they in Scripture so often ioyned togither. Pagans can beleeue that Christ being a man died, but that he is risen, they do not.</p>

For death by GODS iust decree, was pronounced the wages of sinne, <hi>Genesis</hi> 2. we had surely suffered it eternally, if our Mediatour had

                     <p>Very many things; first, that we are bound to loue<note place="margin">That we may haue the fruit of Christ his death, we must bring Abrahams faith, loue &amp; repentance as proofes of a true faith.</note> Christ, who so loued vs. Secondly, we must loue our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes as Christ Iesus dyed for his enemies. Thirdly, sinne is a most loathsome thing, being the cause of Christes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed d ath. Fourthly, that there is iust cause of beeing humbled by this consideration, that wee were the meanes of Iesus death, wee killed the Lord of life. Fiftly, there is matter of great comfort, to heare that our greatest sinnes are done away by his dying for vs, for his bloud was of infinite value, being the bloud of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. Sixtly, that all men must be fearefull to offend God, who shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe so mercifull and so iust, in the death of his sonne: iust to his Son standing in our roome, but mercifull to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing sinners, whome he absolueth by his Sonnes death let this mercy leade men to reuerence God continually.</p>

                        <hi>Paul</hi> hauing taught in the last verse of the former Chapter, that mans iustification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, was founded vpon the death and resurrection of our Lord Iesus being by faith apprehended, now he continueth the same argument, and sheweth what a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of benefits do flow out of this Fountaine of free Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, both to present comfort, and life eternall in the heauens. Vpon the rehearsall and demonstration of which benefits, (as the two principall parts) this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:20835:133"/>
standeth. For first, he reckoneth vp the seuerall and singular fruites of the passion and resurrection of our Lord, beginning with iustification, the foundation of reconciliation &amp; peace, whence the rest do yssue to ver. 5. after followeth the demonstratiue confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the same, to verse 19. Vnto which is anexed an answer, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching a question wherefore the Law entred, namely, to encrease sinne, and make the grace of God to super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abound, in the two last verses. For this first verse, there be these foure thinges done in it. First, the Author and worker of so many great benefits is mentioned, [<hi>The Lord Iesus Christ.</hi>] Secondly, the hand which receyueth him, to wit, [<hi>Faith.</hi>] Thirdly, Iustification, as the ime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate fruite of Faith in Christ. Fourthly Peace, as the neerest effect of a iustifying Faith. Touching the words, by Iustified is meant as afore in Chapter 3. to bee absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from sinne, and accepted as righteous before God, thorow or by faith; that is, not for faith as a meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cause, or by infusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the habite of faith formed by loue, but by faith, as a spirituall hand &amp; instrument re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing Christ dead and raised again. By peace, not mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall concord between Iew and Gentile differing about the Law, but reconcilement with God; and therefore the verbe [<hi>Haue</hi>] is to bee read in the indicatiue, not in the imperatiue moode, as the olde Latine translation reads it; which reading and sence, some of the Fathers fauour, contrary to the authoritie of the Greeke Copy.</p>

First, peace with God. Secondly, accesse vnto his grace. Thirdly, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in that grace. Fourthly, hope of glory: these bee internall, they which follow be externall. Fiftly, reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing vnder that hope. Sixtly, ioy in tribulation. Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenthly, patience and experience out of a sence of Gods loue in Christ. The contrary is <hi>Adams</hi> disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and death ensuing thereby.</p>

                     <p>A two-fold vse: First, there is a reason from them to proue, that Iustification is by faith the reason is this; That Iustification which breedeth and bringeth foorth peace and the rest of these effects, that is, true Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But Iustification by faith, bringeth foorth peace, and the rest of these effectes, therefore it is the true Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification. The second vse is this; by these effects in our selues, we try out the truth and certainty of our Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation before God. Where these effects be found in any true measure, there the cause which is iustification, must go before.</p>

                     <p>They agree in this, that both are quiet, but in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges they differ much; as first, the dead consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is quiet, because it hath no feeling of sinne at all, &amp; of the terror of Gods wrath for the same: but a good conscience is quiet, because it feeleth sinne to be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, &amp; God pacified. Secondly, a dead conscience fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not sinne, but a good conscience is awfull of sinne. Lastly, a dead conscience though it be quiet, yet it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth not; but a pacified conscience hath vnspeakable comfort within it selfe. For, it is a continuall Feast, chearing the heart admidst dangers.</p>

                     <p>It is gotten two waies: First, by grieuing for our sinnes past, done against Gods Law. Secondly, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing the promises of the Gospell touching forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sinnes. Also, it is two wayes preserued, first, by auoyding all, but especially knowne sinnes. Secondly, by doing euerie dutie vprightly, though not perfectly.
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:20835:134"/>

                     <p>Some do vnderstand by grace, the grace of a good conuersation, or of imputed iustice, which here is called Grace, because it is freely giuen; and then to haue accesse, is freely to be brought into such an estate, wherein Christ with his merits is imputed to vs so soon as we beleeue. But by Grace I vnderstand the free fauor of God; and to haue accesse to this grace, is to haue a libertie to come or approach to God in all our wantes, being through Faith in Christ made gracious and fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to vs. This is the same with that of <hi>Paul,</hi> Ephes. 3, 12. Wee haue entrance with boldnesse through confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and faith in Christ: and also with that Heb. 4, 16. Wee may with boldnesse come to the throne of Grace, hoping to finde helpe in the time of neede.</p>

This then is a maruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous great benefit, that we so litle and vnworthy, should be allowed to enter once into the glorious presence of so great and worthy a God.

But whereas it is obiected, that wee may well vse the Saints by them to come to God, as we come vnto Kings by Dukes and Earles; my answere is, that the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is not like.

For as a healthfull sound man falling sicke, he may loose many benefites and comfortes of life; as health, strength, liuelinesse, fauour, beauty, appetite, and such like, but yet retaine life it selfe: So he that once by faith liueth to God, cannot wholy loose this life of faith, though hee loose many effects and companions of this life, which the godly doe loose when they waxproud, grow secure, or fal into some grieuous sins.</p>

                     <p>Grace is double; first, a grace making vs gracious and freely accepted with God: this is vnchangeable as God himselfe, for it is his free loue and fauour.

                     <p>It is true, he was the child of God, and he fell most grieuously, and did long lye in his sinne, but hee recouered his fall and was saued. For first, hee is of the Holy Ghost intituled the beloued of God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 24. 25. which was neuer affirmed of any reprobate. Secondly, hee was one of the penmen of the Scripture, euen an holy Prophet: and of al the holy Prophets, Christ saith they sitte downe in the kingdome of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 28. Thirdly, he was a tipe of Christ, and so was neuer any reprobate. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Gods promise was made especially touching the person of <hi>Solomon;</hi> that howsoeuer his sinnes should be corrected with the rod of men, yet his mercies hee would neuer take from him, nor remoue his louing kindnesse, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. 14. 15. Fiftly, he was by repentance restored to God and to his Church, as appeareth both by the title of his booke,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:20835:137"/>
called <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> which is as much to say, as a person vnited againe to the Church vpon his repentance done and published in the Church. And the argument of that Booke, which is a large condemning of those vanities and follies wherewith he had beene ouertaken, do ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly witnesse his repentance; but none that repenteth can perish, Luke 13, 2.

                     <p>He speaketh of such a sanctification as standeth in profession, and not in power and practise. Secondly,

                     <p>All grieuous sinnes against Conscience, do not vtterly destroy and put out grace, but much weaken &amp; slake the grace of God.

But Gods children after their calling, cannot fall into such, for all their sins come either of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or weakenesse, but not of malice and prophane contempt of God, and these alone do lay wast the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>

                     <p>What think ye of that Doctrine, which teacheth that one effectually called, may wholy through some grosse sin, loose grace, and fall from Christ, yet afterwards againe bee ioyned to him?</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>This is vtterly vntrue, for as Christ being aliue from the dead, dieth no more but liueth eternally vnto God; so likewise the life of grace in his members is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall, and can no more returne to the death of sinne, then Iesus can returne to the graue, Rom. 6, 8, 9. for the life of grace must be the life of glory, therefore eternal and vnchangeable. Moreouer, if a Christian may so fall from Christ, as he shall neede to be engrafted and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him the second time; then also this new ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting must be sealed by a new baptisine, which is absurd and impious. For, as men are but once borne into this worlde, so they are but once borne anew, and are but once to haue the Sacrament of newe birth: and if there be any such extinction of Grace, how is the seed of new birth immortall, and his loue vnchaungeable, and his

                     <p>I doe confidently affirme and that for very good and vndeceiueable reasons and grounds, which I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse in order. The first is from the authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1. 6. <hi>The wicked and his wayes shall perish: but the Godly and his wayes shall be knowne and crowned. Psal.</hi> 37. 24. <hi>The righteous falleth and riseth againe, because the Lorde held vnder his hand. Psal.</hi> 125. 1. <hi>He that trusts in the Lord shall be like Mount Sion that cannot be remoued. Math.</hi> 24. 24. <hi>It is not possible that the elect should be deceiued.</hi> The second rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son dependeth vpon Gods election, vppon which the sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenes and firme stedfastnes of the faithfull is grounded as vpon a most sure rock &amp; mountain of brasse; as it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. where the Apostle hauing spoken of some Apostatates who were falne from God, he doeth comfort the weake minds of beleeuers with this resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that their standing is firme because of Gods election: which for the assurance and certainty of it is there likened to a soundation or seale, two thinges of greatest strength and validity. The third reason or ground, dependeth vpon the free and vnchangeable couenant, which God hath stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with his elect: the tenour whereof is in <hi>Ieremy</hi> 31, 38 40. From whence I doe obserue, that the couenant of grace

and saluation is euery way sure and constant, both on Gods part who altereth not his good wil towards his: and also on our part, who shal haue no wil to depart from God.

This ioy doth differ from worldly ioy in sundrie and manie things. First, Christian ioy commeth from the spirit, the other from the flesh. Secondly, Christian ioy ariseth from the sence of heauenly blessings present, and hope of full blessednesse to come. But worldly ioy springeth from the hauing and presence of earthly and perishing good things of this life. Thirdly, christian ioy is lasting, worldly ioy is fading.

                     <p>They imply a comparison of the more with the lesse, and are thus much. Beleeuers do not reioice alone vnder the hope of heauenly glory, but which is a farre lesse likely matter, they reioyce in and for their afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Or more plainly thus: If beleeuers reioyce, because they certainly looke to be glorified with God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, this is not to be maruelled at: but this is rare and wonderfull, with gladnes to imbrace afflictions, which haue in them both much paine and shame. In the conexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of sentences, note, that it is the propertie of that ioy which ariseth from the hope of celestiall glorie, to cause and breede this ioy which beleeuers haue in their tribulations &amp; sufferings.

                     <p>Of two sorts: some be common to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with other
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:20835:141"/>
men of the world. Some be proper and peculiar to the godly themselues. These common afflictions or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, are sickenesse, pouerty, reproach, famine, plague, warre, banishment, paine, anguish, and such like. These common troubles they all come from God, who is the author of all afflictions: for there is no euil in the Citie, but the Lord hath done it, Amos 3, 6. Secondly, they come by meanes of our sinnes. Man suffereth for sinne, Lam. 3. Thirdly, to the end, to correct for sinne past, to preuent sinne to come, to humble for sinne present, to make triall of patience, to whet our Prayers, to teach vs loue &amp; compassion towards others. Secondly, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and peculiar troubles, they be either such as happen for righteousnesse sake, that is, for a good cause, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for defence of the trueth, or for well-dooing; these trobles be called persecutions. Or such soule afflictions as arise from the apprehension of Gods fierce wrath for sinne, which is called conflict of Conscience. These af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions do arise from the weaknesse of faith, distrusting Gods promises and mercies: and also from the malice of Satan, aggrauating their sinnes and Gods Iustice. The reason why God doth thus afflict his Children is, first, for a more especiall triall of their Faith, also by their constancie to stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ngthen others which be weake, and to reproue the wicked world. Lastly, for the greater ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of Gods glory, who maketh knowne his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in their infirmity, 2 Cor. 12. Now as concerning the vse of this, it is to warne vs to looke for afflictions, and that euery soule is to prepare for tribulations, as Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners prepare against a storme, and Soldiers against the day of battell.</p>
                     <p>Thus the godly haue prepared themselues for trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and beeing vnder them haue reioyced; examples heereof in the Apostles, Acts 5, 41. the beleeuing Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes, Heb. 10. and the blessed Martyrs. True it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, that some of Gods Children haue beene heauie and sad for afflictions, as <hi>Dauid, Nehemiah, Ieremy,</hi> and
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:20835:141"/>
                        <hi>Iob,</hi> but yet they are ioyfull too; their outward man was heauy, their inward is ioyfull: one man at one time may haue contrarie affections in diuers respects, both sadnesse and ioy.</p>

                     <p>When afflictions commeth, then God confirmeth and strengthneth the mindes of his children to patience, by many good considerations.

Secondly, by the conformity of Christ with his members in their afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 29. Thirdly, they are mooued to consider that it is the will of God that they should be patient in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions; therefore their patience it is an acceptable sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and seruice to God. Fourthly, they haue before their eye, the goodwill of God afflicting them in loue, and that they haue reason, wel to beare any affliction which in loue of their saluation commeth to them. Fiftly, they consider all the afflictions of this life, to be both light and momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and that the glory which shall bee giuen to patient Christians, it hath waight and euerlastingnesse, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 17. Lastly, they consider that euery affliction shall not onely haue an issue, but a good issue, which shall bee for the best to them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10, 13. Finally, by afflictions the hope of glory is encreased in the harts of Gods children, to whom afflictions are seales of their blisse: in these meditations the Spirit is effectuall to stirre vp and strengthen patience in the faithfull.</p>

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:20835:143"/>
because it was Gods will to haue it so. The patience also of the Heathen men was grounded vppon necessitie of the matter, it was their lot, and by sorrowe they could neither mend nor paire themselues. Also if they dyed, they thought either they should feele nothing, or else be in better estate.</p>

                     <p>By this Christian consideration, that seeing God was present with them to aide them vnder their crosses, therefore they will hope he will likewise do it still, and in the end make them happy.

                     <p>No such thing: it is presumption to leane vpon our owne strength and wisedome, merits and works, but to rest stedfastly vpon God his mercy and truth, it is the duty of Christian hope: and also, it is an honour which is due to God; for euen by our stedfast hoping in him, he is acknowledged to be a God constant in his truth &amp; mercies. Therefore it is a grieuous sinne in such, as by their long experience of Gods kindnesse in blessing and protecting them, do not grow in hope of his goodnesse and power for heereafter, but waxe rather more faint &amp; distrustfull. This is a token of a very weake, if not of a wicked heart.</p>

                     <p>Thus: they which haue the hope of blessednesse in them, shall not misse and forgoe the thing they hoped for, and so shall haue no cause of beeing ashamed: againe, by considering the nature of humaine and ciuill hope, which if it doe not attaine the thing hoped for, there is shame, which is not here in Christian hope, because it alwayes is sure to attaine the glory which is hoped and looked for, therefore no shame can follow it.</p>

                     <p>That the godly are assured to be saued and glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in heauen; for first the hope of the godly shall not make them ashamed: but the godly do hope for euerlasting life; therefore they are sure and certaine of it, otherwise their hope would bring shame. Secondly, the godly are saide to reioyce vnder the hope of glory; but there is no reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with godly wisemen, but in thinges assured and most certaine. Thirdly, the godly do stay their hope vppon Gods mercifull and true promises, which are constant and cannot deceiue, therefore their hope is certaine. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their hope looketh to the power of God, by perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereof their hope is nourished. Lastly, if their hope were not certaine, how could they call God their Father, which cannot be done in truth, where there is not affiance and confidence in his loue?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>But though the hope of the godly bee certaine for the present, yet their great and many sinnes, and the changeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their will, may make their perseuerance to the end to be doubtfull.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>First, if hope were at any time vncertain, and might misse of glory, then it should make ashamed, contrary to the saying of the Apostle. Secondly, great and many sins cannot make hope vaine, because all sinnes are forgiuen to the godly which beeleeue and repent, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 9. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the godly are taught of Christ, to pray for forgiuenesse of sins, and the confirming of their wils to the end, <hi>Math.</hi> 6, 12. And that which they aske according to the will of God, is granted them. Finally, though mens wils in their nature bee changeable, yet the hope of glory is founded vpon the vnchangeable will and counsel of God.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>What vse and profit is to be made of this doctrine?</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>First, it controlleth the opinion of the Papists, which ground hope (at least in part) vppon merit of good workes, from whence will follow continuall vn certainty, and doubt of saluation; for that they neuer are sure when their merits are sufficient. Also their corrupt opinion wil proue vnsound by these reasons. First, because all hope
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:20835:146"/>
and confidence is accursed, which doth not rest vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, <hi>Iere.</hi> 17. 10. and our good woorkes are not God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no hope is to be put in them. Secondly, such as are newly conuerted vnto Christ, from some wicked life and grieuous sins, they haue hope then, but they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> no me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of woorkes going before; therefore their hope cannot rest vpon their merits which be not: but as for those who haue good workes and liue well, they haue more cause to hope well, because good workes are a good signe of good hope, and some prop they are to helpe hope; but they may not be hoped in, or taken as a cause why we must hope. If any say that patience is a good worke, and <hi>Paul</hi> faith, hope springeth of patience, therefore hope springeth out of works: I answere, hope commeth of patience, but not as from a cause of it, no more then afflictions bee cause of patience. Furthermore, from hence wee are admonished, that such as alwaies doubt of their Saluation, can haue no Christian hope, therefore they must striue against doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Lastly, there is great vse for them which feele them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues indued with Christian hope; for whatsoeuer their afflictions, or enemies, or sinnes bee, yet they cannot bee confounded, but at last must be happy, for we are saued by hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>It is thus much; that the sence and feeling of his loue, is shed and powred into the hearts of his children.</p>

                     <p>It is true: howbeit that was onely in purpose and decree, and so it was secretly knowne to himselfe. But <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of the manifestation of this loue vnto the elect, after they are borne a new: for when the elect are regenerate, then God dooth expresse his loue vnto them, and they do by faith lay hold of the loue of God, beleeuing that they are loued of God, and haue their harts affected with a ioyous feeling of it. For as the box of costly and precious ointment which the woman pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon Christs head, Mathew. 26, 7. gaue no fauour while it was shut up in the box, but being shed &amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out, did yeelde a most sweete sent and sauour vnto all which were in the roome: euen so, the loue of God is pent and shut vp (as it were) in Gods decree, before regeneration and faith, so as it is not felt of the elect; but at their new birth, when they haue faith to beleeue the promise of saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by Christ, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this loue is as an oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment powred out, and doth exceedingly and plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refresh the hearts of the elect, with the sence and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That the most louing God is content not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to loue his children, but withall doth assure them of his loue, so as they certainly know that they are loued, and are cheared in their hearts by the perswasion of his loue. For, as it is nothing to a blinde man to know that the Sunne is a glorious bright creature when himselfe cannot see it: or to a poore man to know where much treasure is, whiles himselfe cannot come at it: so it is nothing to heare and know that there is much loue hid in God, except our selues feele it, and become partakers

of it. Examples we haue of the Apostles, &amp; many other beleeuers, Acts 5, 41. Rom, 8, 38, 39. who haue had the sence of Gods loue in their hearts, and haue reioyced therein euen in their extreame afflictions, in the flames of fire, and depth of Dungeons horrible and darksome.</p>

not fall out, because they haue vncertaine causes; and this hope hath no assurance, but is ioyned with continuall doubting: but Christian hope, it hath alwayes assurance and certainty ioyned with it, because it is of spirituall bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings and protections; also of heauenly glory which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of a most firm cause, namely the vnchangeable good will and loue of God, as also his most free and firme pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise in Christ.</p>

                     <p>The word here vsed, is applyed sometime to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; then it signifieth either weaknesse, which commeth by some disease or sicknesse, after which, men bee feeble; or else it noteth the want of al might, as in that text of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15, 43. <hi>The body is sowne in weakenesse:</hi> or it is affirmed of the minde, and then it is either put for small strength, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 15, 1. or for no strength, as here in this text: that this is here meant, may appeare by this, that they which are called weak, the same are called vngodly, sinners, enemies; such are voyd of all spirituall and sauing power, to beleeue or repent.</p>

                     <p>That they for whome Christ was giuen to death, were such as had no force of their own to help themselues, but needed all manner of helpe vnto saluation. Secondly that such as Christ died for, doe not onely neede all helpe, but being vngodly, refuse helps being offered; and beeing sinners encrease their euils more and more, and which is most of all, they grow in hatred of the remedy, being open enemies to God: heere is a singular gradation to amplify Gods loue to lost mankind.</p>

                     <p>It sheweth the wretched estate which men liue in without faith in Christ. Secondly, it condemneth the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of such as affime that the elect beeing in this estate, were yet Iustified, and the sonnes and heires of God: this their madnesse may appeare in this, that the selfe same per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons at one time, shal be actually and indeed both enemies and friends to God, sinners and righteous, vngodly and sonnes, to need all helpe, and yet to haue all helpe; this is to confound heauen and hell grace and corruption, Sathan and God, death and life togither. Thirdly, it confuteth the Pelagian and Papist, who ascribe some strength to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to prepare, at least to dispose it selfe to grace. This the Pelagian sets forth by a similitude of waxe fitte for any impression, of white paper, or a naked table ready to take any forme: so is our nature (say they) apt to learne, if it be
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:20835:148"/>
but taught vs: also the Papists they expresse it by the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of a man sore wounded or much enfeebled, or laden or borne downe with bolts and fetters, which with a little helpe of another mans hand, will raise vppe himselfe, and make shift to stand vppon his feete: So say they, nature is but wounded, enfeebled, or ouerburthened, and with litle helpe of grace, can reare it selfe to heauenwards. These their corrupt opinions appeare to be false, by <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 1. where it is written that wee are dead in trespasses and sins, and therefore as touching God and godlinesse, wee are by nature dead corps; and in this our text, we are said to bee of no strength. Fourthly, it prouoketh Gods children to great humility and thankfulnes towards God, to consider what they were before their conuersion; for the more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable our former estate, the more amyable present grace: also it must moue them to compassionate others, which yet be in this woeful estate, seeing themselues once were such. And lastly, it must stirre vp a feruent loue to God, who in this most pittifull case loued vs, and gaue such a guist and remedy to vs, and for vs.</p>

                     <p>No lesse then Christ, his owne and onely begotten Sonne, which is the greatest and best guift that the most<note place="margin">As God could not sweare by a greater then himselfe so he could not giue a greater then himselfe in the person of Christ.</note> great and good God could bestow vppon mankinde: the reason is, because it is more worth then all the world: for it is himselfe in the person of his Sonne, therfore the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test. Also through this gift all other gifts are made good and profitable to vs, which else would bee so many curses. Therefore the best cause that moued him to bestow such a gift vpon vs, was the good pleasure of his will, which here and elsewhere is called his loue, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3, 16. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.</p>

From whence the Apostle doth gather, that if Gods loue bee such, as our sinnes before we did beleeue, and whiles we were enemies, could not hinder him from giuing his son to die, much lesse shall those sins which wee do afterwards, be able to hurt our saluation; therefore the hope which the godly haue in God, cannot make them ashamed.</p>

                     <p>This comforte; that true beleeuers which haue their sinnes forgiuen them by Christ, they haue good hope that they shall certainly bee saued: the reason is plaine, for if Christ by the merit of his death being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued in, could set the elect (being enemies) in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of saluation: now that he liueth, surely hee is able by his power to set them (being friends and reconciled) in the possession of saluation. Secondly, from hence are reproued such as say, that true beleeuers may fall from grace and perish: also, such as teach that they ought continually to doubt of their saluation, as the Papists do teach. Lastly, it reproueth Gods Children which doe yeeld to doubtings of their owne saluation. For this is an iniury vnto Christ as if he were not strong enough to saue them, whom he was sufficient to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile. This is a most excellent place for the infallible (not probable and coniecturall, as Romanists speake) certainty of glory, and perseuerance in grace. Lastly, wee are taught by example of our heauenly Father, to make atonement with our enemies.</p>

Thirdly, to reioyce concerning God, it is to be merry in our hearts for this, that we do vnderstand how God doth loue vs, as a father his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. The like vnto this, we haue in Ier. 9, 24.

Such onely do reioyce; therefore such as waigh these things, and do inwardly feele them, so as they are are affected with them, do from hence gather exceeding strong hope of enioying euerlasting life.

                     <p>First God, to whom wee are reconciled, he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs, and giuing his sonne for vs. Secondly, his Son comming to worke our attonement by his obedience, passion, and Sacrifice.

                     <p>That our Christian and spirituall reioycing, it is as our measure of beleeuing is: none, if our Faith bee none; little, if our faith be little; great, if our Faith bee great. Therefore, as any do long for much true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an comfort, let them endeuor a daily increase of Faith, by the humble, sincere, and constant vse of al those ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meanes priuate and publicke, whereby God vseth to enlarge the beleefe of his children.</p>

                     <p>Yea, very great: for we were two wayes endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered to God, 1. by not fulfilling and keeping the law (as we are bound) we lost all right and title to Heauen.

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Two wayes: First, by the word reioycing or glorying, vsed in the former verse, wherein hee makes his passage to this Treatise.</p>

                     <p>Thus much: beleeuing Christians cannot fully reioyce and glory concerning God, vntil together with the discharge from the paine due to their sinnes by free forgiuenesse through Christs passion, they know and beleeue themselues to be decked and blessed with that absolute obedience and righteousnesse which the Law requireth, and vnto which by the promise of the Law eternall life is due: which seeing they haue not nor can haue in themselues, therefore they haue it of Christ.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>What is the second way how ye gather this distinction of two parts of Iustification?</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>By the comparison of <hi>Adams</hi> vnrighteousnesse and his disobedience, with Christ his obedience, both communicated to all elect persons, though in diuers sorts and fashions, the which he doth begin in verse 12. and continueth it to verse 20.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>Both in things wherein they are like one to the other, and in things wherein they are contrary one to
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:20835:154"/>
the other. They are alike in this generally, that each of them conueyeth that which is his, vnto such as are theirs, and be of them; particularly, <hi>Adam</hi> sendeth ouer to all that come of him guilt of sinne and death by his disobedience imputed; Christ conueyeth ouer righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse and life to his members by free imputation of faith. Also they differ in this, that the offence of <hi>Adam</hi> by which death came vpon all men was but one, but the obedience of Christ imputed to beleeuers, doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly couer and doe away that one, but all other offences of the elect: also his obedience putteth vpon the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a righteousnesse which meriteth a farre better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition then wee lost by <hi>Adams</hi> vnrighteousnesse: this vnlikenesse is pointed at, verse 15, and further laide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, verse 16, 17.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>These: First, it will serue to confirme our minds touching the certainty of hauing the righteousnesse of another giuen to vs to make vs happy, this beeing as reasonable as that the vnrighteousnesse and sinne of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother should be deriued to vs to make vs guilty. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it will serue much to humble Gods Children, to consider well the nature and force of sinne, and what hurt they haue taken by it. Thirdly, the great benefit they haue from Christ will bee better knowne, more hungred after, and esteemed of vs more greatly by set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting before it the contrary euill, as a cure is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended being compared with the danger of the disease.</p>

                     <p>Two: First, a proposition of the double harme which is come vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whole world by <hi>Adam,</hi> through whom all men are vnder sinne and death. Secondly, a reason heereof, in as much as all men were in <hi>Adams</hi> loynes when he sinned, and so sinned in him; (<hi>In whom wee all haue sinned.</hi>)</p>

                        <hi>Adam,</hi> as verse 14, vnder whom <hi>Eue</hi> also is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; for sinne came by them both, Psal. 51, 5. but the man is named, and not the woman, because hee being the man, was the more worthy person. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee was more in fault then <hi>Eue,</hi> in regarde of his more eminent power and grace. Thirdly, sinne is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated and deriued to vs, rather by the Father then by the Mother, because he is the principall agent in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>

                     <p>Two thinges: First, the infinite hurt that may come of one person being euill, &amp; the meruailous good that may redound to many, by one being good.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, to admonish Parents verie carefully, to looke to the education of euery one of their Children. Secondly, that it behooueth the publicke state much, what manner of person he is that beareth gouernment. Thirdly, it behooueth them who haue gouernement, to watch ouer the manners of all men vnder their charge, because one man neglected, may marre all, as <hi>Achan</hi> did, Iosh. 7.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>An exceeding comfort to great offenders, so they turne and beleeue the Gospell; which may bee rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thus; <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> which sinned so heynously, &amp; also wrapt their whole kind (euen a worlde of people) within sinne and destruction, were yet receiued to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and saued: therefore let no sinner (how horrible so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer) be out of hart, if they come to the throne of grace for pardon, with trust to haue it.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>What is further to bee obserued from this, that it is saide [Sin entred by one man?]</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Euen this: that God is not to bee blamed, as cause and author of sinne, seeing it came in, by, &amp; tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough man. For, whereas <hi>Adam</hi> might haue refused the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:20835:155"/>
temptation if he would, he freely obeyed, and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yeelded, and so sin entred by him, without any fault in God, who had made him righteous, and giuen him freedome of will.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Was there not a necessity herein, that Adam shold yeeld?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>True, there was so, in regards of Gods counsel, who had decreed not to strengthen his wil in the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but to forsake him; yea &amp; further, that being left to himself, he shold follow the suggestions, that so there might be occasion of giuing and sending his Son, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the world, to the manifestation of his Iustice and mercy. But notwithstanding this, yet Adams disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was voluntary, because Gods decree, tho it ruled the euent &amp; businesse, yet offred no force to <hi>Adams</hi> wil, which could not be compelled; &amp; therfore of it own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, enclined it selfe to fulfill the motions of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and his wife; and therefore the whole fault of our fall lieth vpon Satan and our first parents, as the proper cause of sinne. For God made man righteous, but they found out sundry inuentions, Eccles. 7, 31.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>What was further learned by this, that sinne entred vpon al by meanes of one man?</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>That sinne is not by creation, but came in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Secondly, how dangerous it is to hearken to ill counsell; by meanes whereof, <hi>Adam</hi> being depraued, did depraue the whole world.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <p>The men which dwell in the world, whither elect or reprobate, as it is expounded afterwards, Death came ouer all men. The word [World] somtime signifieth that fabricke or frame of heauen &amp; earth, as Iohn 1, 10. The world was made by him. Secondly, it signifieth elect me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely, which are the chiefe part of the world, Ioh. 3, 16. And God was in Christ reconciling the world, 2. Cor. 5, 19. Thirdly, it signifieth the wicked &amp; reprobate onely. Iohn 17, 9. Fourthly, the corrupt qualities and fashions of the world, 1 Iohn 2, 15. Loue not the world. Fiftly, the

                     <p>That hereditary disease, called commonly origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sinne, or birth-sinne, spread ouer our whole kind, as a Leprosie, and hath tainted the whole race of vs. That this onely is heere meant may appeare: First, because he vseth the singular number; but when he speaketh of the fruites of it, he vseth the plurall number. Secondly, that which he calleth sinne heere, he afterwards in verse 17. calleth disobedience of one man, which must needes be the first or Originall finne. Thirdly, hee saith verse 17. by this sinne many are made sinners; and this is only by originall sin. Fourthly, there was no other sin brought death ouer all men except that: therefore that sinne is onely meant heere In that I call it hereditary, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, as a disease which resteth in any stocke, and des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth from father to sonne, so is this sinne; it runneth from <hi>Adam</hi> through his whole progeny, from Parents to the Children, euen to the worldes end, as it is sayde heere, It came ouer al men.</p>

                     <p>That this sinne is hard to be expelled out of mans Nature, as hereditary diseases are hard to be cured; and therefore must the more be striuen against. Secondly, that Children haue no faults, which they doe not bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and deriue from their parents, of whome they haue corruption, which is the spawne of all sin; which should cause in parents commiseration and patience towardes their Children.</p>

                     <p>There is guilt or fault, because wee are made sinners by it, verse 17. and there is deseruing of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because this cannot be seuered from the former. Also it is expressely saide, that by it, death went ouer all.</p>

                     <p>Because it is written, That weee go astray from our Mothers wombe, <hi>Psal.</hi> 58, 3.

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It is a naughty vicious quality in our Nature, whereby it is enclined to all euill naturally, and vndis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed vnto any good, yea enemie to God, and disposed against all good, as Titus 3, 3. Hating God, Col. 1. Minds set vpon euill workes. The fruites of this our corrupt Nature, are all sinnes whatsoeuer, euen all those sinnes reckoned vp, Ro. 1. 29, 30, &amp;c. Gal. 5, 19. Tit. 3, 3. Col. 3, 5. or in any other place, euen all maner of sinnes, not blasphemy against the Holy-Ghost excepted.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, it begetteth lust; which is an euill moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or desire sweruing from Gods will: this is the spawn of all sinne. The second is, obedience to this lust, Rom. 6, 12. which we call consent, when the will yeelds vnto the euill motions, with purpose and resolution to do it: this is called of <hi>Iames</hi> the conception of sinne, Iam. 1, 15 Then thirdly, there followes an euill action in word or deede, this is called of the same Apostle, the bringing forth of lust (it bringeth forth sinne,) that is some out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grosse acte in speech or action. Lastly, the going ouer this sinnefull acte by custome and continuance in it; this is called the perfection or finishing of sinne: vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:20835:157"/>
all this, there succeedeth death, as the terme &amp; last period or full point of this proceeding and course in sinning, wherein it resteth.</p>

                     <p>But how proue ye, that Original sin, hath priuation or absence of Originall righteousnesse?</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>This is the consequence vpon all the former; for we could not be guilty, deserue punishment, and be corrupt, if we had our first perfection. Secondly, except we had lost that, we should not need to seeke and fetch that from another, euen from Christ, as ver. 17. Thirdly, when the Scripture saith, <hi>God made man righteous, but they found out many inuentions,</hi> Eccl. 7, 31. This prooueth, that the perfect righteousnes giuen vnto vs in our creation, is not only lost, but thorow our owne fault lost.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, because it is from the beginning. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because it is first in vs before grace. Thirdly, it is the first head &amp; beginning of all sins. Lastly, it is in vs from our beginning, euen from our very conception.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>First, it confuteth the errors of such, which say, it is nothing but priuation of righteousnes. Also such as say, it is nothing but the inclination of our nature to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. Secondly, it sheweth the most heauy case in which we are all by birth, we being all ouer-couered with cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and sinfull putrifaction, rotten and ful of sores; and not so full of euill, as voide of all goodnesse, and so hatefull to God, whose pure eyes cannot but hate vs &amp; abhorre vs; and therefore we are called the children of wrath, Eph. 2, 3. See Ezck. 16. No leaper, no lazar, no <hi>Iob</hi> to be compared to vs; if we saw our selues, wee should loath our selues. Thirdly, the knowledge heereof, must humble our stomacks and courages. Fourthly, it must stir vp great care of being washed and clensed from this spot: all the water in the sea is too little to wash this one staine, all care in the world is not great enough to get it scoured out, Psa. 51, 2, 6. either repentance for this sinne, or for no sinne.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="309" facs="tcp:20835:157"/>Fiftly, it must stir vp a desire and a thirst after the pure and holy conception of Christ, which is the couer to hide, the Salue to cure this originall sore. Sixtly, it may make vs compassionate and mercifull one to another, especially to our children, being all alike infected, and they by vs: and therefore in our chiding and corrections, were should bee moderate. Seauenthly, it must keepe vs from extolling nature, and the goodnesse of nature; for all natures euen the best is poysoned, there being nothing good in vs till grace come and plant goodnesse in vs: for can one gather figges of thistles, or grapes of thornes? <hi>Math.</hi> 7.</p>

                     <p>A twofold life; first, of grace being led by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, which moued him wholy to celestiall and diuine things, this is called spirituall life. The second is of nature, wherby he was moued to follow those good things which tend to preserue nature, and the estate of his body: of both these kinde of liues <hi>Adam</hi> was depriued, and so dyed a spirituall and naturall death: for beeing before ioyned to God, in his fauour, mooued by his spirit: hee now hauing sinned, was turned from God, lost his sauour and spirit, and so could not aspire to any diuine thing, but had his heart wholy set vpon euill; and touching his naturall life he was threatned, that to dust he should go.</p>

                     <p>Yet naturall death was not inflicted vpon him after his sin, for he liued still in the world, and that a great while.</p>

                     <p>He did so, howbeit he may be said to be naturally dead, so soon as he had sinned. First, because by the guilt of his sinne, hee was presently subiect vnto it. Secondly, God streight way gaue sentence of death vppon him, and
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:20835:158"/>
therefore hee may bee saide, straight way to haue dyed, as condemned persons are called dead men, though they bee respited. Thirdly, the messengers and souldiers of death, presently tooke hold on him and arrested him, as hunger, thirst, cold, heat, diseases dayly wasting of his natural moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, to the quenching of life: but God did spare him that the sentence was not presently executed, to commend his patience, and to giue <hi>Adam</hi> thereby, occasion of saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for the promise beeing giuen, and hee called to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance &amp; faitb, by that meanes attained a better life through Christ, then he lost through sin.</p>

                     <p>That God doth not delight in the death of sinners but rather that they should returne and liue. Secondly, it teacheth vs patience towards such as are offenders of vs, being ready to receiue them to fauour, whensoeuer they truely repent.</p>

                     <p>The equity is iust, for that one mans sinne was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery mans sinne: for <hi>Adam</hi> was the roote of our kinde, and therefore this fault is not personall resting in himselfe, but reaching to all his posterity, which were then in his loynes, as <hi>Leuy</hi> was in <hi>Abrahams</hi> loynes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7, 10. For such iuice as is in the tree, commeth to all the branches; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so such as is the water in the fountaine, such it is in the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer; and some such diseases as be in the parents, descendeth to the children: also amongst vs men, the father beeing a Traytor, the whole bloud is tainted.

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:20835:158"/>
of Christ the head, is conuayed ouer to the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, so it is here: againe, God who is most iust, so decreed and would haue it; that the grace which <hi>Adam</hi> had, hee should keepe or loose for himselfe and all mankinde, who were to stand and fall wih him: thus it appeares to be very equall.</p>

                     <p>First, it reproues the vulgar conceit, that God will not punish but for actuall sinnes.

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>First, that euery one is bound to make account of dying euery moment, hauing sinne the matter and means of death still about him. Secondly, that the da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of such a brood, that is sinne, which causeth no lesse then death, is most carefully to be auoyded and abhorred, euen to be fled from, as one would flie from death. Moreouer, think that if an others sinne could doe this, as to make thee culpable of death, what will that sinne do which thou doest in thine owne person? for <hi>Adams</hi> sinne is thine in account, not in act; yet so as this proueth <hi>Adams</hi> sinne to bee euery mans owne proper sinne, as if he had himselfe acted and done it, because else he should not dye for it: for men in iustice are not to suffer death for any sinne, saue that which is their owne by act, or imputation. Christ had had wrong done to him, to be brought to death, if sinne had no way belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vnto him; for death is not inflected but with reference to sin.</p>

                     <p>But howe could that bee, seeing that yet there was no law, and sin is the transgression of some law, and indeede what law could be giuen to some of them, as to Infants which had no vse of reason?</p>

                     <p>Therefore the Apostle in affirming, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this, there was sinne in the world; hee mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth there was a sinne euen afore the Law, by which sin al men were borne sinners, being both guilty of wrath, and corrupted euen from the wombe. This is the sinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> in whose sinning, all men were comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he being head and roote of our kinde, as was sayd verse 12.</p>

                     <p>Belike then this is now the scope of the Apostle, to proue, That as al men are guilty by their owne sinnes, vvhich they do in their owne persons, and haue in their owne Nature: so there is a sinne of Adam, by guilt whereof, al men are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious and culpable of death?</p>

                     <p>True, this is in verie deede that which is inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and wherein <hi>Adam</hi> is like Christ: the one, being fountaine of sinne vnto death; the other of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to life.</p>

                     <p>That afore the Law was giuen, sin was not so thoroughly knowne and reputed: but when the law was published, it was better knowne and became more greeuous.</p>

                     <p>That death came in not by creation, but by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Secondly, that if men accompt death terrible, they should not thinke sleightly of sin the breeder of it.</p>

                     <p>Yet the Apostle saith of some, that they shall not dye but be changed, <hi>Cor. 15, 52.</hi>

                     <p>True: yet that change shall bee instead of death to them. Secondly, this is the condition of all men, that through sinne they are subiect to death; God may priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whom he will, as <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias.</hi>

                     <p>Yet sinne is still in them, whence commeth death to them, not as a part of the curse for sinne, but as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into heauenly blisse, whither they cannot come but by death; so as they are freed from the hurt which death brings, but not from the necessity of dying.</p>

                     <p>That all men are so to make account of death, as they doe prepare continually for it, and arme themselues continually against the fear of it, by keeping faith and a good conscience.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <p>That parents haue cause to mourne for sinne in their young children, as well as for their owne. Secondly, that in the death of their children, they consider not so much the losse as the cause which is sinne; which would keepe them from impatiencie, &amp; serue to humble them. Thirdly, that there is diuers kindes of sinne (to wit) vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, inuoluntary, originall, actuall.

                     <p>It is true, that we haue lost a perfect righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in <hi>Adam,</hi> but yet (the person of Christ considered) we haue a more excellent righteousnes from him, which bringeth vs to a blessed life in Heauen. Secondly, it is also true, that all other sinnes do come from originall sinne, yet they are not of necessity knit vnto it: for then all men should haue the selfe same sinnes, euery one should doe such sinnes as others doe. <hi>Abell</hi> should haue done murther as <hi>Cain, Iacob</hi> should haue been prophane as <hi>Esau, Peter</hi> should haue beene a Traitor like <hi>Iudas,</hi> &amp;c. which is not so: Therefore other sins of our life, though they spring from the roote of birth-sinne, yet our sclues are to be blamed for them, as being done by our owne election and consent. Now Iesus Christ our redeemer absolueth and freeth vs not onely from that one sinne of <hi>Adams,</hi> but from innumerable heapes brought in vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that by our owne deliberation and counsell, and so excelleth it very farre: for to take away many sinnes is more then to bring in one offence; and a righteousnesse which consists of many good acts as Christs doth, is more excellent then one sinneful act, such as <hi>Adams</hi> transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was.</p>

                     <p>The power and force of Christs righteousnesse aboue <hi>Adams</hi> offence, respects not number of persons, but worthinesse and number of effects, which are more and also more worthy, from the righteousnes and grace of Christ. For first it blotteth out <hi>Adams</hi> sinne, and all others as touching guilt. Secondly, it breaketh the strength and rage of sinne. Thirdly, it reformeth the heart to new obedience, and giueth interest to perfect glory.</p>

Secondly accidentall, which belongs to his manhoode, and is inherent in the man Christ, or in his humanity as a quality: this accidental righteousnes (which is a quality,) is twofold; first an habit of most perfect vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnes and holines, infused into his humane nature, euen

from the moment of his conception by the holy Ghost. This is opposed or set against the corruption of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: of the imputation whereof, at the eight Chapter is spoken at large. The second is, the most absolute Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and obedience which hee performed in the actions of his life, and sufferings of his death: this is the effect or fruite of the former habit, &amp; it is distinguished of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines into actiue righteousnesse, consisting in the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the workes commanded in the morall Law; or pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue righteousnesse in suffering obediently the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of death for our breach of the Law. The imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this wee haue heard of in Chapters 4, and 5. vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the 11. verse; and now in this place, he entreateth of his actiue righteousnesse, as it commeth instead of that guilt of Adams disobedience imputed to his posterity.</p>

                     <p>To note, that this Grace did ouercome Adams offence, for that was but one acte, Christs righteousnes consisteth of many actions. Secondly, that was but one fault, his righteousnesse both quits vs from that and all other sinnes, and gets vs to be pronounced iust &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of eternall life. And besides all this, with that grace of righteousnesse, there goeth the reforming of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, breaking the force of sinne, and framing vs againe to Gods Image, which cannot be lost, as afore hath been saide.</p>

                     <p>There is so, and very great: for beeing all in <hi>Adams</hi> loynes when he sinned, we sinned with him, and so euery one at the instant of our conception, are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by sinne: whereas, though Christ were promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from the beginning, and had suffered death long since, yet it doth not benefit vs, till we do beleeue and receiue him.</p>

                     <p>That great neede there is, that euery one labour for this true faith. Secondly, the blessed estate they bee in which haue it, for they haue receiued Christ and his righteousnesse vnto life eternal; by which assurance they be armed against doubtings.</p>

                     <p>That these fiue things are knit together. Christ, Righteousnesse, Grace, Faith, and Life; haue one, haue all; lacke one, lacke all.

law by doing it, necessary vnto the iustification of a sinner before God, or his passiue obedience in sufferiug death doth it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone iustifie vs? for the Scripture ascribeth our purging, remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sins, and saluation, to his bloud and death in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, &amp; it may seem that Christ kept the Law not for vs, but for himselfe, to make him a meete high Priest.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>Iustification hath two parts: First, the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sinnes, secondly the making of vs iust. For as we owed vnto God a satisfaction by death for the breach of the Law, so we were bound to performe subiection to God with all power of body and soule, and all the might of those powers euen from the time of our being. Therefore as we needed the passion of our Lord to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the first debt of paine and punishment, so the other debt of homage and conformity to the will of God, was answered in the obedience of his life; that so we might not onely escape death, but finde an entrance into life eternall, which without perfect obedience to the commandement, might not bee granted, according to the tennor of the Law, <hi>Doe this and liue,</hi> Leuit. 18, 5. By which words it is plaine, that by meere passiue obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience wee could not haue possession of life, which is promised to doing all that is required in the Law: for euen Christ himselfe by his doing the Law, may claime and challenge eternall life, and it cannot be denied him in rigor of iustice, because hee fulfilled the condition of workes enioyned by the Law: and how should we think to haue life without the Law done? which not beeing possible by our selues, therefore Christs obedience in his life, must be imputed to make vs capable of life. For seeing euery iote and tittle of the Law must bee done, Mat. 5, 18. therefore the sum and substance much more. Now the summe of the lawe is to loue God with all our harts, &amp;c. and this cannot be done by vs which are sinners; then there must be a translation of the lawe from vs in our persons, vnto the person of our mediatour who must do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery iot for vs: therefore he saith it behooued him to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:20835:169"/>
all righteousnesse, <hi>Math.</hi> 3. and that hee is the end of the law for righteousnes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10 and hath made vs iust by his obedience, as in our text; and became subiect to the law, to redeeme vs which were obnoxious to the law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4, 4. 5. And indeed seeing Christ himselfe was giuen vs, and that he was borne for vs, wrought miracles, suffered death, arose, ascended, &amp;c. how must not his life also be ours? A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, is it not written that Christ was made our sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication as well as our righteousnesse, and our righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse as well as our redemption? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1, 30. Moreouer, he that continueth not to doe all things contained in the law is accursed, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. last verse. Where of it followes, that if any wil auoyd the curse of the law, he stands bound constantly from his conception till his death to keepe the law: which forsomuch as none can do by himselfe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the contents of the law must be accomplished by our surety, or else no escaping the curse. Besides, if the actuall obedience of <hi>Adam</hi> made vs sinners, howe should we be iust without the actuall obedience of Christ? and it seemes that Christ should be but halfe a Sauiour, only suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, and not doing things pleasant to his Father for vs. What meaneth that, that Christ sanctified himselfe for vs? <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. and who knowes not that it is written of Christ, that hee came to doe his Fathers will? <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. Whereas Scripture attributeth our saluation to his bloud, that is a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> a part put for the whole: likewise where iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is placed in forgiuenesse of sins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4, 5, 6. and the bloud of Christ shedde, beeing his chiefest obedience; as it comprehends the rest that went afore, so it excludeth onely legall sacrifices, as not meritorious.</p>

                     <p>In the conclusion he doth meet withall, and make answere to a secret obiection made in the behalfe of the law. The obiection is this, that if the obedience of Christ be our full righteousnes before God, without the works of the lawe, then to what end doth the law serue? To which the Apostle doth first propound his answere barely (verse 20.) and nakedly; that the law was giuen, first, to encrease our guiltinesse. Secondly, that the grace of Christ thereby becomes more glorious; the which the Apostle doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large by a comparison of contraries, (verse 21.) sinne and death set against righteousnesse and life, as contrarie one to the other; the sum of which comparison is thus much: that as sin preuailes to make all guilty of death, so the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of Christ beeing freely giuen to the beleeuers, doth preuaile much more to make them partakers of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life.</p>

                     <p>No, not so; the Apostle doth not note the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, with what purpose he gaue it, but the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent that did follow the giuing of the Law, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our offence did more abound.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>In these respects: First, because a Law beeing giuen, sinne was made more grieuous now by the breach of it. Secondly, sinne is more stirred vp and irritated by the Law, our nature desiring the things that are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden it. Thirdly, the Law doth affoord vs a clearer sight and knowledge of our sinnes, which were more manifested vnto vs by the Law, as may bee made plaine vnto vs by these comparisons, first of a Glasse, which makes vs see the spots of our face what they be, and how foule they bee. Secondly, of a Candell which doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer vnto vs the thinges in a Roome which lye out of order, and could not be espied in the darke. So by the law we come to vnderstand what our sinnes be, and how greeuous they are.</p>

                     <p>Of a skilfull Surgeon or Physition, who by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and healing great and desperate wounds and disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, doth not get more skill, but doe more manifest their skill which they had. Secondly, of a most kind Prince
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:20835:171"/>
or father, who by pardoning some great faults of their Children or subiects, do so much the more make known their clemency and kindnes, by how much their offence was more heynous: in like manner the more and fouler the sinnes be which be forgiuen vs of God, the more plentifully doth he declare his grace. From whence we learne; first, that wonderfull is the wisedome and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God, that can turne such a thing as sinne is, to the praise of his grace; as <hi>Dauids</hi> fall, Psal. 51, 1. and <hi>Peters</hi> deniall, Luke, 22, 32. Secondly, it affoordeth a great comfort to great sinners, so as they feele their sinnes &amp; beleeue in Christ; for whatsoeuer their sinnes be, there is mercy with God, more then to counteruaile them: grace in Christ is more able to saue, then <hi>Adams</hi> sinne to condemne. Thirdly, God suffereth men to abound in sinne, with a meaning not to destroy them therefore, but to poure and shew forth his goodnesse more richly: therefore let none with <hi>Caine</hi> say, my sinne is greater, &amp;c. but rather with <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Tim. 1, 15.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>But will not this Doctrine giue some liberty to sinne?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>Nay: it is a restraint rather and bridle from sinne; for Gods children are made the more carefull not to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him, by how much the more they feele his mercies to be great towards them. Therefore if any abuse this Doctrine to licenciousnesse, it is a maruailous bad signe and a fearefull token that they are growne desperate.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, that sinne rules as a king in al vnbeleeuers. Secondly, while sinne beareth rule, whatsoeuer men do, tendeth to destruction. Thirdly, all Gods elect are first vnder the raigne of sinne and death. First, Prisoners, wounded, dead, ere they be healed, deliuered and resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to life.</p>

                     <p>That as there is a kingdome of sinne, so also there is a Kingdome of Grace; vnder which two Kingdomes the elect must passe. For, they are translated from the raigne of sinne, to the raigne of Grace, as the people of <hi>Israell</hi> were drawne out of <hi>AEgypt</hi> into <hi>Canaan:</hi> and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euerie one must belong to one of these kingdomes, therefore our care must bee, to examine vnto which we are subiect.</p>

                     <p>Two things: First, that the Doctrine of free Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification by faith, dooth not destroy good works, but produce them rather. 2. the doctrine of good works or Sanctification, must follow the Doctrine of Iustification: as an effect the cause, and fruit the roote.</p>

                     <p>Iustification, is an action of God, imputing to vs the perfect righteousnesse of Christ when wee beleeue in him. Sanctification is a worke of the Spirit, framing in the hearts of the elect, a new quality of holinesse. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Iustification remoues from vs the guilt &amp; curse
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:20835:172"/>
of sinne, Sanctification remoues and takes away the rule and power of sinne. Thirdly, Iustification is as the cause and roote, Sanctification is as the fruite &amp; effect, thogh both done to vs at one time. Fourthly, Iustification is perfect heere, Sanctification is vnperfect and encreaseth daily, till at length by degrees it bee perfected in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>From <hi>Pauls</hi> words, when he saide, <hi>Where sinne abounds, there grace more abounds.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>How did they collect &amp; reason from hence?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Thus: it is a good thing that Grace should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, therefore to liue securely and purposely to sin,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:20835:173"/>
it is a good thing, for by that meanes grace shall abound the more.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>But if the encrease of sinne do cause grace to encrease, why should it not be good to encrease and multiply sin, seeing it is a very good thing that grace should abound?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sylas.</speaker>
                     <p>This obiection is very faulty and absurd; for first it maketh sin and encreasing of sin to be the cause of grace, whereas it is but the occasion onely: as a discase makes a Phisition famous by occasion onely, for his skill in his Art is cause of his fame: so our sinnes beeing many and great, are occasions of illustrating and magnifying the grace of God, and not causes to purchase grace for vs; they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede properly causes ofire and vengeance. But howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer sins are not, nor can bee causes of grace, yet there nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an aboundant and infinite grace to take away sinnes, beeing mightily encreased: this then is the first fallacy in their reason, that which is no cause put for a cause. The next fault, it is in the ambiguity of the word; for they take this word (<hi>where</hi>) as if it were as much as (wheresoeuer sin abounded) which is not so; many beeing ouerwhelmed with sinnes, as <hi>Cayne, Esau, Iudas, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> &amp;c. which had not a drop of grace affoorded them. The meaning of the Apostle is this: where sin abounds, that is, of whome sin is aboundantly knowne and felt, with desire of the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which is Christ, towardes them grace is more aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly shewed and knowne. Lastly, there is a fault about diuersity of time, for <hi>Paul</hi> speakes of sins done afore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, these cauilers did wrest his sayings to sins afterwards: that whereas the more our sins are afore regeneration, the more aboundantly doeth grace vtter it selfe in doing them away: yet hereof it followeth not, that therefore one bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing regenerate should sin more impudently, and securely.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>What other things doe ye obserue about this obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>

reade or heare Scriptures, to ponder them, ere by way of reasoning we gather any thing from them. Secondly, we may aslure our selues, that the doctrine of our Church tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching iustification by faith without works, is a found doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, because such thinges are obiected by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our teaching of this truth, as was against <hi>Paules</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the same; as that it opneth the window to sin, &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowes all care of good works. Thirdly, that the tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and their doctrine, bee subiect to wicked cauillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and therefore they haue neede of wisedome and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and their hearers, of charity.</p>

                     <p>Hee doeth not answere the argument, but doeth perfourme two things in his answere. First, he detesteth that consequent, that men should continue in sin: God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid; wherein hee sheweth how grieuously hee taketh it to heare the Gospell defamed with wicked suspicions and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations, whose zeale herein for the truth, deserues to be followed. Secondly, hee giues reason why beleeuers ought not continue in sin, because they are dead to sinne, therefore they ought not, they cannot liue in sinne: it is an argument from contraries, as if ye would reason thus of <hi>Moses:</hi> he is not aliue, because he is dead; or of a man that he heareth not, because he is deafe; so the regenerate being dead to sin by mortification, which is the first part of sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, it cannot bee that they should liue in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of it, for death doeth exstinguish life, as all men doe know.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sylas.</speaker>
                     <p>The first noteth a person vnregenerate, that is yet vnder the power of sin, drowned in the lusts and desires of
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:20835:174"/>
sin. The second speech poynteth out a person deliuered from the dominion of sinne, and so hee doeth not follow and serue the wicked sinfull lusts of his corrupt nature, but is as a dead man to them. Look what difference is between one that is vnder the water, ouer whelmed in a whirlepoole where he hath no footing, and another which is compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with waters, but hath sure footing, and his head aboue water; such oddes there is betweene one dead in sins, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plunged deepe into the lusts of the flesh ouer head and eares, and another that is dead to sin, beeing so compassed with infirmities of sin, as there is a power in the Soule ouer them, from the sanctifying grace of Christ.</p>

                     <speaker>Sylas.</speaker>
                     <p>It is this, in the whole course of ones life, and all the actions thereof, to be obedient to the motions of sin; as a mans life is nothing but a continuall act of sinning. From al which we learne, that seeing euery iustified person is sanctified, and dead to sin; therefore such as still obey their wicked lusts, and licentiously liue in sin, in vaine doe they professe themselues to be beleeuers, and to haue their sins forgiuen them: for such as be dead to sin, are no more to be perswaded to loue and practise sin with delight ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, then a man naturally dead is to bee mooued to feare or ioy, by hauing terrible or pleasant things presented to him: and they which are otherwise, following the seruice of sin with pleasure in it, therein sufficiently testifie that their sins are not forgiuen, and that they are vtterly voyde of faith, because they lacke sanctification, the necessary fruite of faith.</p>

                     <p>Thus: Christ Iesus consists of two Natures, hee is God and Man, as man hee dyed.

                     <p>Christes bodie buried, was by his diuine power kept from corruption in the graue, and that verie power of Christ buried, workes the continuall wasting of sinne, that it may dye by little and little in his people.</p>

                     <p>That diuine power that raised the dead bodye of Christ out of the graue, worketh in the elect the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of their soules, from the death of sinne to the life of righteousnesse.</p>

                     <p>First, that Christ is a Sauiour, not by merit one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but also by vertue and efficacie. Secondly euery chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian that desireth to partake in the merit of Christs death for Iustification, must labour to haue fellowshippe with him in his death for mortification, and to feele the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his resurrection vnto newnesse of life. Thirdly, such as haue fellowship with his death, for the leauing of sinne, with a hatred of it; and with his resurrection for the leading of a godly and a iust life, out of a loue vnto God and to his Law, do thereby declare, that they are one with Christ himselfe grafted in them.</p>

                     <p>By two pledges and testimonies, the one inward,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:20835:176"/>
the other outward: the inward, is the change of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, when the heart loatheth the sinnes it was wont to loue, and striueth against them; and loueth such Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and duties as once it did abhorre, endeauouring to do them with a desire to please and glorifie God. The outward pledge is baptisme, which is no empty &amp; bare, but a powerfull pledge and instrument thereof. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is said, <hi>We are baptized into his death,</hi> that is to say, it is an effectuall pledge of our fellowship with Christ in his death, aswell to Sanctification as to Iustification.</p>

                     <p>The holy Ghost by the water of Baptisme (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sprinkled vpon the childe) as by an instrument, not onely sealeth but worketh Sanctification, by linking &amp; knitting the elect nearer vnto Christ, from whome they draw vertue and power, not onely for the mortifying &amp; the burying of their sinnes, but for the pleasing of God in a new course of life. Or thus: the death of sinne is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually represented by the water cast on vs at our bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme; and buriall of sinne, by our being vnder the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and by our comming out of the water, is signifyed our arising out of our sinnes to a better life, thorough the power of the holy Ghost, applying Christ his death and buriall for the beating downe of our corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and his resurrection or our quickning to godlinesse of liuing.</p>

to God for such a testimony and instrument of his grace; and in this regarde, stand bound to depart from sinne, and to liue godlily, especially hauing made a solemne Vowe and couenant in their Baptisme, that they will not serue sinne in the lust thereof, but God in keeping his word, and doing his will therein reuealed, to the vtmost of that Grace which they haue receiued.</p>

                     <p>Sundry things: First, that naturally we are stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from Christ, beeing in the stocke of rotten <hi>Adam,</hi> whence we must be taken that we may be one with him. Secondly, that whiles we remain in <hi>Adam</hi> out of Christ, we can no more do any good, then a grift can bring forth fruite being alone, and seuered from the stocke. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to the end we may liue spiritually to God, wee must first be vnited to Christ, as the plant or grift is vnited to the Tree, into which it is planted. Fourthly, whatsoeuer power is in vs to do good, or to leaue sinne, it is al from Christ, not from our selues. As the graft set in a stock, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth now no life from it selfe, but from the stocke into which it is grafted. By this is quite ouerthrown the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of nature and grace.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>These two things: First wee learne, that as Christ had no way opened vnto his resurrection but by death; so till we depart from sinne, we cannot be raised vp and renewed to a righteous life. Secondly, as Christes death and resurrection be ioyned together: so our death to sin is euer accompanied with a newe and vnblameable life, which can no more bee seuered from mortification, then the resurrection of Christ can be seuered from his death: and therfore our Apostle hath truly affirmed before, that such as bee dead to sin cannot liue in it, verse 2. for nowe they lead their liues according to God.</p>

                     <p>It is a sure truth, that no similitude doth holde in all things, it is sufficient to holde in that for which it is applied; as in this present similitude which is brought to shew, that as a slip passeth from one tree to another, and hath life from that stock into which it islast planted, so the elect passing from <hi>Adam</hi> to Christ, are partakers
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:20835:177"/>
of his spirit: but as in euery other similitude there is a dissimilitude, so in this likenes there is an vnlikenes, and it doth consist in two things: first, the slippe or grift is taken from a good tree and fastned to a wilde. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it retaineth still his olde nature though it be planted into a new stocke: now it is not so in this spirituall plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of men into Christ. For wee are plucked from an vnfruitfull tree and wild Oliue, euen from the corrupt nature of <hi>Adam,</hi> and are grafted into Christ as a most noble stocke, a tree of righteousnesse, whose very leaues are wholesome: also we put off our old nature which we had afore, and leaue the affections which spring of our birth-corruption, &amp; are partakers of the spirit of Christ, whose nature and properties we put on.

                     <p>Of the kinde of death which Christ suffered; namely, the cursed death of the Crosse, by which death he deserued the Holy-Chost for vs, to crucifie, that is, to pull downe the strength of sinne, that though it be, yet it may not rule in vs.</p>

                     <p>Wee are to vnderstand it thus: that when Christ suffered vpon the Crosse, the corruption of our nature was imputed to him as to our surety, who once bearing the punishment of it, doth not onely for euer take away the guilt from vs; but doth daily by his spirit (which by that death he merited for vs) kill and crucifie that our olde man, that it may not raigne in his members: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is heere written in the present time, that our olde man is crucified with him, to teach vs, that howsoeuer his death was but once suffered, yet the merite thereof and efficacy is euerlasting in al those which are one with him by faith; therfore he is said in Hebrews to haue pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased eternall redemption.</p>

                     <p>First, wee can neuer sufficiently abhorre our corrupt nature and the lusts that spring from it, sithence it was that which nayled Christ to the Crosse. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we must labour to feele the vertue of Christ crucified in the mortifying of sinne, and then wee may assure our selues of the benefit of Christ crucified, in the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:20835:179"/>
of sin. Lastly, as Christ gaue himselfe wholly to the crosse for our sakes, so ought wee to striue against all and euery sin, not bearing nor nourishing any one sin, but kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vnder one as well another; seeing Christ spared none of his members and parts of his body, which were all and euery one payned for our sinnes, euen from his head to his feet.</p>

First, to teach vs that sin is a thing subsisting and of force in vs. Secondly, because it hath innumerable lusts, as it were so many members annexed to it. Thirdly, though sin bee seated in the Soule, yet the desires of sin are execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the members of our body, as by instruments.

members of their body, that which sin desireth and lusteth: and on the other side, the not seruing of sinne, is when the motions and desires of sin, are not obeyed either in wil or worke, but be cast out of our thoughts, words and deedes, as much as may be.</p>

                     <p>Such as is betweene the hauing of a naughty ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, and the suffering him to rule all in the family. Euery godly man hath sin, but hee keepeth it vnder, as a seruant or slaue, not suffering it to command or beare rule in them.

                     <p>The seruice of sin is manifested by the obedience<note place="margin">How many wayes the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of sin is knowne.</note> to the desires and lusts of sin; as it is written. His seruants we are to whome we obey; and this obedience is manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by yeelding vnto sinfull thoughts, in consent of our will, and in practise of our life. Also by striuing for our lusts, and defending of them: by hating and disliking them which reproue vs; by louing such as sooth and flatter vs in our euill wayes; by vpholding and mantayning sinne in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; by giuing fauours and appoynting rewardes vnto sins and vices.</p>

                     <p>They are to bee discerned and knowne by these<note place="margin">How Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites be discerned fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> true Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note> markes following. First, though they do in their outward actions yeeld obedience to the word, yet they doe still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the yoak of sin, for they loue not those duties which yet they do for sinister respects of profit, or prayse, or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:20835:180"/>
themselues or others: and those sins which they leaue vndone, yet they still like them in their hearts, as the people of Israel being deliuered from the bondage of <hi>Tharao,</hi> loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked back into Egypt in their thoughts, wishing themselus there againe; so it is with these men, they leaue the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward act of sin, and yet loue sin, hauing their hearts set vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it. Secondly, the seruants of sin, though they forsake many sins, yet not all their sins they stil keep some beloued sin, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their trade, or of nature which they serue as their mistresse: and though they do sundry duties touching the outward deed, yet they leaue vndone some duty, as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary as any which they doe, because it crosseth their lustes. Thirdly, those sinfull actions which they doe forsake, and those good duties which they doe persourme, they doe but for a time; for they are soon weary of well doing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to their sins as a dogge to his vomit. Lastly, they that be the seruant of sin, both in the good which they do, and in the euill which they would doe, they are ledde and driuen by corruption, that is the ground-work and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of all their actions, they walke after the flesh, not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the spirite: the flesh (that is their sinfull nature) is the pipe after which they dance, and the guide which they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>

Which affoords a great comfort vnto those which morne for sinne, and a speciall admonition vnto such as be yet secure: it will bee sufficient to either of these, it henceforth they look vnto it, mourning and loathing that which is past, beeing carefull hereafter no more so to sin.</p>

                     <p>Very many and sorcible: First because the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of sin is a spirituall bondage, the end of which seruice is shame and euerlasting death. Secondly, if we serue sin wee cannot serue Christ, for no man can serue two such contrary maisters. Thirdly, it is contrary to our vowe in baptisme, where wee promise that wee will forsake sin and serue God. Lastly, wee are by mortification dead and freed from sin, and therefore we are not to serue it.</p>

                     <p>By a comparison of naturall death and the effects thereof, which our Apostle doeth touch in the seauenth verse; when hee sayth, they which are dead are freed from sin: the meaning whereof is this, as they which are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally dead, cease from their sins, which they were wont to doe whiles they liued: so beleeuing Christians which are spiritualy dead by mortification, must resolu to cease from their former sins.</p>

                     <p>True, it is so; yet the godly Christian is free from sin in a twofolde respect. First, because the guilt and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of sinnes is forgiuen him by Christ. Secondly, because he doth no more follow the impulsion or motion of sinne, but as a bondman deliuered and ransomed from some cruell Lord, doth not now any thing at the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of that Lord, whose yoake he hath shaken off. So it is with true beleeuers, being once deliuered from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and rule of sinne, they are no more vnder the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment and becke of sin, and though they bee not free from the corruption of sin, which cleaueth to their nature as skin to their flesh or as the flesh to their bones: yet they are free from the command and compulsion of sin, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more to bee ruled and ledde by it, but by the spirite of Christ.</p>

Sixtly, if he sinne at any time, it is with godlye greefe, which causeth fresh repentance, neuer to bee repented of, 2 Cor. 7. Seauenthly, he laboureth to pul others out of the bondage of sinne, and to keepe from sinning, such as are set free there-from, especially such as bee vnder his charge. Eightly, he is ioyfull and heartily thankfull for his owne libertie in Christ, and for the freedome of others, Rom. 7, 24. Lastly, he loues Christ which hath freed him, and tenders the glory of Christ his deliuerer, aboue his owne saluation, Rom. 9, 2.</p>

                     <p>It sets forth the doctrine of sanctification, by comparing Christ and his members together in these 4. things, wherein they are one like the other. First, as Christ dyed once for sin, so all his members are once to dye to sinne. Secondly, as Christ being dead did liue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, so all his members are quickned by him to liue a new life. Thirdly, as the life which Christ now liueth is perpetuall and can neuer bee againe extinguished by sin or death, so all his members shall perseuer to the end in newnesse of life. Lastly, as the end of Christs death, was to take away sinne, and as the glory of his father was the end of his life; so it is in his members, their mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall quite abolish sin at the last, and the vprightnes of their life, tends to the glorifying of God, who takes himselfe much honoured, when his bee holie, as hee is holie.</p>

                     <p>To be dead with Christ, it is to haue communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or fellowship with his death, for the mortification of our sinnes, by the vertue and power of his Spirit, which his death merited for vs; and to liue with Christ, is to haue communion with his life, or to be partakers with his life, whereof there be two degrees. The first degree is the life of grace in this world, whereby beleeuers are enabled to thinke and do in some measure thinges plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vnto God. The second degree is the life of glorie, which they shall haue and liue in heauen in all perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, louing God, his Angels, and Saintes with all their heart, soule, and strength.</p>

                     <p>Two thinges: First an instruction, that dying to sin, and newnesse of life are inseparable. For he that hath the first, cannot but haue the latter. Secondly, a conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:20835:182"/>
that the life of Christ is annexed to his death: for they are sure to haue part with him in his life, both of grace and glory, that haue part with him in his death. So the Apostle saith, <hi>We beleeue it;</hi> that is, we are certainely perswaded of it, that the life of Christ belongs to vs, if we be dead to sinne; it is no matter of opinion or coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but of faith.</p>

                     <p>First, that Christ was dead to take away sin, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching guilt and dominion. Secondly, that he was raised from death to life again. Thirdly, that his life is no more subiect to death, for it cannot againe be quenched with sinne and death; whereupon doth follow these two most comfortable things. First, those sinnes of ours, vvhich were imputed to him, he hath wholy abolished and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himselfe from them. For if any one of our sins were not taken away by him, either he must not rise from the dead, or being risen, he must returne againe to dye: for where sinne remaines vnremooued, there of necessitie death hath power, because it is the stipend of sinne. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that as Christ hath freed himself from our sins &amp; death, so he wil free his mebers wholy from them both. For he tooke our nature vpon him, to that end, to chase sinne and death out of it, as it is written, <hi>He came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the works of the deuil,</hi> 1 Iohn 3. Also in his death &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection he bare our persons, and for vs and in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe ouercame sinne and death, as if wee our selues had done it.</p>

                     <p>This knowledge must serue vs to these vses. First, to prouoke our thankefulnesse vnto Christ, who hath wrought our liberty from sin and death, the two maine enemies of our saluation.

                     <p>That Iesus Christ was once not onely dead, but vnder the dominion and power of death; not as one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned as it he could not haue kept him selfe from the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of death, but willingly because he would obey his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers decree, who had appoynted that death (for our sin) shouldseaze vpon him &amp; hold him as prisoner in the house of death for a time: &amp; this is the lowest degree of Christs humiliation, contayning the true meaning of that article of his descension into hell: hell signifying the graue, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the phrase of scripture; and descending into the graue, was the putting of his body vnder the dominion of death for a certain space. The vse of this is to teach vs humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that the same mind be in vs which was in Christ; who at hee abased himselfe to such a vile condition for our good, so ought wee in humblenesse of minde to serue and profit others, though they bee our inferiours, and though wee should put our selues to doe very meane or hard things for their sakes.</p>

                     <p>The end of Christs death, which was to abolish and wholy take away sin, both touching the punishment and the power of it: therefore it is saide, hee dyed once to sin, that is, to take away sin from his members, by that one death, which he once suffered. Also it containes the end of his life, which he now liueth in heauen; to wit, the glory of his Father: therefore it is written that he liues to God, that is, to the praise of God, and in his glorious presence, or most gloriously.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>First, that our sinne was the cause of his death. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that sin in the elect shall be destroyed and taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the merit &amp; vertue of his death: the time wil come (to wit after this life) that the children of God shall bee as free from sinne, as Christ himselfe is. Thirdly, that for the destruction of sinne, it was sufficient for Christ once to
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:20835:183"/>
dye, and therefore the sacrifice or offering of Christ in the popish Masse to take away sinne, is absurd and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable: it is absurd because it implies a taking away of sinne, without death, and a sacrifice for sinne without bloud, or else an iteration of his death, or often shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of his bloud, all which is most absurd: it is abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable, because it is directly against the Scripture, which speaketh of Christ as of one once dead, and once offered. Secondly, because it doth derogate from the allsufficiency and perfection of Christs onely sacrifice in his death; for if his sacrifice bee sufficient for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to take away sinne, their sacrifice of the Masse is su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous; if this be needfull, then Christs is weake.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That it is sufficient for vs, once to be mortified, and once to dye to sinne, from whence wee may gather that they are in an error, which thinke that the grace of mortification and repentance, may be wholly lost; for then Gods Children must twice dye to sinne: howbeit though the grace of sanctification is but once giuen, yet Christians must labour to cherish &amp; preserue that grace, with purpose neuer to returne againe to the seruice of sinne, as Christ neuer returnes vnto the Graue.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Why is it said that Christ raised from the dead lines to God, seeing he alwayes liued vnto God, euen afore his death?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>Christ after his resurrection from the dead, doth otherwise liue vnto God, then he did before his death. For though it be true, that alwayes euen before his death as well as after, he was led by the spirite of God, and did all things to the praise of God; yet before his death hee so liued to God, as hee had in him as in one who was a true man, the infirmities of our nature, wearinesse, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, thirst, cold, &amp;c. and vpon him as vpon our surety all our sinnes charged and imputed; but after his resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection hee so liueth to God as his manhood is wholly freed from all infirmity of nature, and imputation of sin,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:20835:183"/>
being most perfectly glorified.</p>

                     <p>The whole man consisting of Soule and body; now he doth rather name the body then the soule, because sin is first conuayed into the soule by the body, and afterward executed and fulfilled by the body, as an organ to the soule in committing of sin.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>First, seeing Christ hath put into them the grace to<note place="margin">Therefore.</note> mortifie their sin, it is their part not to suffer it to bee idle &amp; vnfruitful; but to labour more and more to keep vnder and maister that enemy which Christ hath already begun to slay and destroy. Secondly, because wee are mortall<note place="margin">Mortal.</note> and subiect to death, therefore our resistaunce of sin must be the stronger, seeing it will shortly haue an end. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if we striue against the kingdome of sin to hinder it, we are sure to conquer it, otherwise it will ouercome vs to our euerlasting shame and destruction.</p>

                     <p>But what needeth this exhortation to the faithfull, in whome sinne cannot haue any kingdome, because Christ is their King, and ruleth them outwardly by his word, and inwardly by his Spirit?</p>

                     <p>It is very needfull, because by their owne care and endeuour in resisting sinne, it is kept from exercising any rule or kingdome ouer them. God who will not haue sin to rule in his children, the same God willeth his children not to bee secure, but to doe what they can to stoppe and hinder the power and course of sin in themselues: GOD workes by meanes.</p>

Lastly, of warriours who set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their enemies, where they finde them feeblest; so sin being in time resifted, ere it get hold on our will, or break foorth by the members of our body, is kept from bearing rule ouer vs and held vnder as a slaue and vassall.</p>

Whereby the Apostle giueth vs thus much to vnderstand, that as kings are maintained in their Kingdome by the ready obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their subiects in peace, and by their willingnesse to fight for them in time of warre: so the raigne of sinne is furthered by the same meanes, and hindered by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing these meanes; that is, by not obeying nor figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for the lusts of sinne, as a King must needes fall and come downe when his Subiects will not obey him, nor beare weapons against his enemies.</p>

                     <p>It is as much as to exhibite and voluntarily to present our selues before sinne, to doe the lusts of it; as Souldiours of their owne accord shew themselues in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of their Lords and Generals, to take commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from them.

<pb n="370" facs="tcp:20835:188"/>
may appeare by these reasons. First, there is no reason to speake of any other law, for it is besides the Apostles purpose. Secondly, it appeareth by the 7. verse of the 7, Chapter, where an instance is giuen out of the morall Law. Thirdly, it is the morall Law which by forbidding of sinne doth encrease sinne, and stirreth vs more to goe after sinne, and so makes it more hard to be ouercome.</p>

First, they are freed from the Law, as touching<note place="margin">How free from it.</note> the curse &amp; malediction, whereof in the former Chapter. Secondly, as it is a Schoole-maister to compell and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force vnto duty, 1. Tim. 1, 9. Thirdly, from the rigor of the Law, as it doth exact perfect obedience, but giues and brings no helpe to performe any thing towards it. Lastly, they are freed from it as it is the vigor &amp; strength<note place="margin">Iubet, non Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat.</note> of sinne, more and more encreasing and stirring it vp by forbidding and prohibitions; for this is the naughtinesse of our crooked nature, more earnestly to run vpon such<note place="margin">Nitimur in vetitum, cupimus semperq, negata.</note> euils as we are most restrained from, and in this last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect are we said in this place not to be vnder the Law.</p>

                     <p>That the godly being freed from the Law, as it is the vigor and strength of sinne, sinne now will be the more easie to be mastered, so they striue against it; euen as a woman by the lack of her husband is much the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and sooner ouercome: so it is in this case, sin with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Law to strengthen and stirre it vp, is as a wife without her husband, as in Chapter, 7, 1, 2, 3.</p>

                     <p>Grace signifieth the free forgiuenesse of our sinnes through the merite of Christs death: in this sence the Apostle vseth the worde Grace in the former three Chapters, wherein he intreateth of Iustification. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it signifies the gracious helpe and assistance or the worke of Gods spirit, for the mortification and killing of sinne; and so it is vsed in this Chapter, where he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treateth of Sanctification. Now (to be vnder this grace) is to be in such an estate, as to haue the Spirit of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to raigne in vs and rule ouer vs, as a husband ouer his wife, and a King ouer his Subiects.</p>

                     <p>That the faithfull need not feare that sinne shal conquer them if they striue against it, because the grace that ruleth in their hearts, is stronger then sinne: as if the Apostle should say, Be strong, quit your selues like men and fight valiantly, and suffer not sinne to raigne; for he that is with you, to wit, the spirit and grace of God, is mightier then your enemie sinne that is against you, you are both graciously pardoned your sinne, and graciously assisted. The Prophet <hi>Elizeus</hi> when his seruant was in<note place="margin">2 Kings. 6, 15, 16.</note> feare vpon the sight of the <hi>Aramites</hi> army, did thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him, saying; Feare not, for they that are with vs are more then they that are against vs: in like manner must true beleeuers encourage themselues against sinne, to thinke that a stronger then it, is on their side; for though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>By (Sinne) is meant heere, not one act of sin, but a continuall course of sinning, and it is as much as if it had beene said; Shall wee liue or leade our liues in sinne, as before verse 2. or shall we serue sinne, verse 6. or shall we obey sinne? This then is the meaning of the obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Shall wee giue ouer our selues licenciously to sinne, because wee are not vnder the Law but vnder Grace? Which obiection did arise from the ill vnderstanding of the Apostles words. For his words were so taken of some as if hee had meant (by not beeing vnder the Law) our freedome from the gouernment and doctrine of the law, and so the bridle being cast loose in our necks, we might haue liued as we list; which was very farre from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles meaning.</p>

                     <p>Our first instruction from this Obiection, is to learne how ready and prone sinnefull men bee to snatch vp all manner of occasions which may nourish liberty in sinne, peruerting holy doctrine to this end: therefore al men must watch ouer their owne hearts, being naturally bent to these crooked shifts, auoyding the company of sinnefull men which affect such naturall licenciousnesse. Secondly, that the il vnderstanding of things wel taught, breeds errors and cauillings, and therefore we must take heed of mistaking good doctrine. Thirdly, that there is no doctrine so sound, but one or other will carpe at it &amp; wrest it: therefore Teachers must arme themselues with patience. Fourthly, that Ministers of the word, must<note place="margin">Titus. 1,9.</note> haue skill not onely to teach the truth, but how to meet<note place="margin">2. <hi>Part.</hi> Answere.</note> with, and conuince such gaine-sayers.</p>

                     <speaker>Sylas.</speaker>
                     <p>It is first to be noted, that the Apostle doeth not directly answere their cauilling argument which is Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall, being a fallacy from the ambiguity of the speech, (of not beeing vnder the law) which the obiectours tooke as beeing meant of a freedome from the obedience of the law; wheras the Apostle vnderstood it of the rigorous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action of the law, forbidding euill thinges, and giuing no strength to forbeare them; but rather prouoking our lusts more after such euils as it forbids. Our Apostle therefore contents himselfe to answere the consequent of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: namely, that which was vntruly concluded and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from his owne doctrine; to witte, (that we might freely sin:) this consequent he answereth two wayes. His first answere is, by words of detestation [<hi>God forbid</hi>] in 15, verse: hereby teaching vs that all wicked and false things inferred from the worde, must bee abhorred of vs. In the second part of his answere, he proues the quite contrary to the obiection, namely that such as bee not vnder lawe, but vnder grace, ought not to serue sin, but Christ their Lord.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>How doth he proue this, by what argument?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sylas.</speaker>
                     <p>By these two reasons: the first is taken from the condition of Seruants, in the beginning of the 16. verse. This reason standeth thus; It is meete that euery one obey him, whose seruant he is: but all true beleeuers are the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God and not of sin: therefore are they bound not to obey sin, but God, in doing his will. Which the Apostle doeth confirme and backe by the testimony of euery mans conscience: know ye not that a seruant must obey him that is his Lord, and that Christ is your Lord, and not sin? ye all know this, by the light of nature the one, and the other ye know by the light of the word.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sylas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, that it is wisedome in the Ministers of the word, to build their doctrine vppon knowne and receiued principles, of which euery one is conuicted, that they are true. Secondly, wee must iudge of our seruice, either to
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:20835:190"/>
sinne or to God, not by our profession, but by our practise and obedience: if we do fulfill and obey the lusts of sinne, then are we the seruants of sin, whatsoeuer wee professe or say to the contrary. Thirdly, that it standes with great reason, that a Christians life should be a continuall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Christ, because he is our Lord, and hath admitted vs to be his seruants; who by nature through <hi>Adams</hi> fall, were wholly captiues to Sathan and sin: but Christ by his death hath freed vs from this captiuity, and addicted vs to himselfe, to this end that we should not now serue sin our former Lord, but Christ our new maister, who hath deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vs from sin and Sathan; as seruants which paste from<note place="margin">1, Cor, 6, 20, Luke 1, 74, 75</note> one maister to another, doe euer please and serue the latter maister.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>What is the second reason whereby he proues that wee ought to obey Christ, and not sin?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sylas.</speaker>
                     <p>The second reason of this text, is taken from the effects which follow the seruice of Christ and of sin, which be death and life: (whether it bee of sin to death, or of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience vnto righteousnesse.) This second reason hath two branches, and may be thus framed; such as obey and serue sin must haue death for their reward, therefore wee ought not to serue sin, least we dye for it. Againe, such as obey Christ by doing righteous things, shall haue eternall life for their reward: therefore wee ought to obey Christ, and renounce the seruice of sinfull lusts, that wee may liue for euer.</p>

Secondly, that all men must doe seruice to one of these two Lordes, no man can serue both at once, because they commaund contrary thinges. Thirdly, wee learne here the nature of sin, that it is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the obedience of the lawe or vnto righteousnes, therefore a filthy, vnrighteous and bitter thing. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the seruice of sin is to bee auoyded as a damnable or deadly thing, bringing to destruction in hell, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:20835:190"/>
it. Lastly, that a righteous life that yeelds o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience vnto God, shall end in eternall life, though it cannot merite it.</p>

                     <p>But our Apostle hauing said (whether of sin to death,) why did he not likewise say, (or of righteousnesse to life?) but saith thus, of obedience to righteousnesse. What are we to learne by this kinde of phrase and stile?</p>

                     <p>These three things: First, that this is the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of workes, to liue obediently vnto the will of God, reuealed in his word, as the righteousnesse of faith is to haue sinne forgiuen by Christ. Secondly, that this is the beginning of eternall life, to leade heere a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life, which is the entrance of it, and the way to it. Thirdly, because he would haue none to thinke that life<note place="margin">Psal. 119, 1, &amp; 112, 1. 2, Pet, 1, 11.</note> eternall is due to obedience, in such sort, as death eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall is due to sinne. For this is due as merite, the other by the promise of mercy: the one is a debt and stipend of sinne, the other is of grace, and a fruite of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, depending on Gods meere goodnesse, and not on mans desert: for how can creatures and Children make their Creator and Father indebted?</p>

                     <p>A new argument or reason to perswade the Romanes, and in them all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to resist the motions of sin that they may serue God.

                     <p>First, whosoeuer be deliuered from sinne, may heere learne, that their deliuerance is not in their owne power, but is the worke of God, and they are beholden to him for it. Hence it is, that all regenerate persons, are called the workemanship of God, Ephes. 2, 10. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in this example of <hi>Paul,</hi> wee learne to reioyce and be thankefull, as well for the conuersion of others, as for<note place="margin">Ephes. 1, 3.</note> our owne: and this is indeede a note and a marke of one<note place="margin">Phil. 1, 3, 4.</note> truely conuerted, to be vnfaignedly glad for the worke of Gods grace in others.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, this teacheth, that the end of our freedome<note place="margin">Ephes. 1, 6.</note> from sinne, in respect of God, is his owne prayse, that hee might be acknowledged, praised, and thanked. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Apostle would shew, what a great benefit it is to be deliuered from the tiranny of sinne, for which God cannot be sufficiently thanked.

                     <p>They were the Seruants of sinne, which is the common estate of all the elect before their new byrth; they all and euerie one of them, are first the seruants of sinne, before they are the seruants of God, Rom. 5, 6, 8. 10. Acts 26, 18.</p>

Seruant is more subiect to the will of his Lord, then we are vnto lusts and desires of sinne: so that wee can will,<note place="margin">Gen. 6, 5.</note> thinke, speake, or doe nothing, but what sinne will and<note place="margin">Co. of. 1, 21.</note> commaunds. And this is a most fearefull and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous estate, much worse then the cruell tyrannicall bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and slaueric of Egypt. For first, that bondage was of the bodye onely, but the seruice of sinne is of the whole man, bodye and soule. Secondly, in the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of Egypt they serued men; but heere in this bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, seruice is done to sinne and Satan, most vile Lords which commaund most base and silthy workes. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the bondage of Egypt, the most harme was tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, losse of libertie, smart and paine of body: in this seruice of sinne, the losse is eternall, euen destruction in hell for euer, without the infinite mercy of God. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this bondage vnder <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> they had a sence of their thraldome, and desired liberty; in this seruice of sinne, men do not so much as suspect themselues to bee bound, but thinke themselues to be free &amp; despise liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Re. 3, 17. Lastly, in al outward bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dage, they which be bond can help themselues, as by running away, or by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty, or by ransom: in this bondage we lie stil as it were bound hand and foote, til God by his mercy deliuer vs, not so much as the least thought of relieuing our selues.</p>

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to prouoke them to a great thankfulnesse vnto him, who freed them from so heynous a yoake. Lastly, to moue them to withdrawe their hearts further off from that vile seruice of sinne, which they haue so well esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; as no slaue will returne to that tyrant from which<note place="margin">Luke 17, 32.</note> he is deliuered; so neither ought sinners to looke backe againe. <hi>Remember Lots wife.</hi>

                     <p>That such as bee freed from sinne, though they still haue sinne in them, yet they are no more seruantes to sinne. For they haue changed their Maister and their Liucry, and are become seruants to a new Lord, to wit; Christ Iesus their Redeemer.</p>

                     <p>By the Doctrine of the Gospell, which in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect is in Scripture called the Arme of God, Esay 53, 1. An immortall seede, 1 Pet. 1, 23. The sauour of life, 2. Cor. 2, 16. The power of God to saluation, Rom. 1, 16. A forme or a mould, as in this Text fitly. For as a mould or forme vseth to leaue behinde it such a print or Image as it selfe hath, vpon such things as are put vpon it, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; so doth the Gospell, it altereth the minds &amp; hearts of men, and maketh them lke it selfe, that is to say, ful of heauenly wisedome and holinesse. And heerein consists the difference betweene the Doctrine of the Lawe, and the Doctrine of the Gospell. The Doctrine of the Lawe forbiddeth vs euill, and commandeth vs good, but put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth no strength in vs to forbeare the one, or to doe the other; and therefore it is called the Ministery of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: whereas the Doctrine of the Gospell teacheth vs Faith, Loue, Hope, Repentance, Patience, &amp;c. and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all imprinteth the selfesame graces in vs; giuing vs po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to be that which it would haue vs to be. Therefore, is it tearmed the Ministery of the Spirit, and of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, 2 Cor. 3, 8, 9.</p>

                     <p>Two things: First, that in our conuersion and freedome from sinne, we our selues do nothing towards it at all, but suffer God to worke vpon vs; as the waxe or<note place="margin">Non agimus, sed agimur; sumus merè passiui.</note> clay receiueth the print of the seale or mould, themselues doing nothing, but suffering the impression only of the
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:20835:192"/>
Seale or mould. Secondly, we haue continuall neede to haue the stamp of heauenly doctrine put vpon our Soules, because the image or forme of godlinesse which wee haue from that doctrine, receiues continuall decay by our owne negligence and Sathans mallice. Hence it is that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaking here of the godly <hi>Romaines,</hi> sayeth in the present time that they are deliuered, to teach that the worke of our sanctification, is not a worke of a day or a yeare, or to be perfected by one or two, or a few Sermons, not till death come.</p>

                     <p>What may this put vs in mind of, that the doctrine of the Gospell is the effectual Instrument both to begin and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect our deliuerance from sin?</p>

                     <p>It serues to surre vp a great loue vnto the doctrine of the Gospel, seeing it is the means of our conuersion. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it shews of what great efficacy that doctrin is: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God is pleased to worke by it, it can pull our heartes from sinne, and knit it vnto God; and can make vs be like vnto God, who before did beare the Image of Sathan.

                     <p>The preface is contained in these words (I speake after the manner of men.) This phrase hath sundry sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications, one is this: I require no harde matter, but such as men are able to performe. The second is this, I require no vniust thing, but such as any that hath the reason of a man, would grant to be equall and iust. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I speake plainly and familiarly, as euery man may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily vnderstand me, fetching a similitude from common matters knowne to all men, because ye should the better perceiue what I say. Of all these expositions the last is best to be allowed of, because of that that followeth in the verse, where he borroweth his comparison from the worldly affaires of men, such as all men by reason and common experience knew and were well acquainted with.</p>

hindereth that they could not receiue heauenly thinges, being taught them in profound and exacte manner, as appeareth by the example of <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and also by the words of our Sauiour to him, Iohn 3, 12.</p>

                     <p>Three-fold: First, it concerns Ministers, that they apply themselues in their teaching, to the capacitie and rudenesse of their hearers, which being rude, therefore the plainer we speake, the better it is. The second, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes hearers, for whom it is safest to bee taught with the greatest plainnesse that may be, because of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their vnderstanding; which euen in regenerate persons is more carnall then spirituall, their blindnesse and ignorance being far more then their sight &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Lastly, it reprooues such Ministers which teach darkly and couertly, affecting obscuritie in matter and in maner of teaching; and such people as loue to bee so taught, loathing simplicity.</p>

                     <p>These foure: First, they wholly serued sin [<hi>Your Members</hi>] that is to say, your selues. Secondly, they ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued sinne with all readinesse, and with their whole

strength [<hi>Ye haue giuen</hi>] that is, yee haue willingly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented your selues before sinne, as a Seruant before his Lord to do his will. Thirdly, they did and fulfilled not one, but all manner of sinne, which is meant heere by vncleannesse and iniquity. Fourthly, they proceeded &amp; went forward from one degree of sinne to another (<hi>To commit iniquitie</hi>) whereby is meant the outward work of sin, and that they rested not in the inward lust and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of sin.</p>

Secondly, they must do it with great readinesse and alacrity [<hi>Now giue.</hi>] Thirdly, they must serue God in euery duty, [Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which hath our dutie to man, and Holines which hath our dutie to God.] Lastly, they must goe forwards, and profit daily in godlinesse and in the seruice of God, as they did before in the seruice of sin and wickednesse.

                     <p>To be vtterly without it, and void of it, and a stranger from it. As before verse 17. to bee free from sin, signifieth a cleane riddance and deliuerance from all sin,<note place="margin">If vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men be free from Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, then they haue no inclination at all to it, saith <hi>Beza.</hi>

                     <p>First, it teacheth a true cause why naturall men doe so greedily striue for the fulfilling of the desires of sinne: the cause is, for that they are vtterly without righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse<note place="margin">Homo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

As an vntamed Colt runncs headlong hauing no rider or bridle to stay him, or as Children grow rude and wanton, being without Tutors or guides; so they which are free from righteousnesse which should bridle their nature, must needs sinne Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and horribly. Secondly, it sheweth the miscrable condition of naturall and vnregenerate persons, in that they are stript of all grace, and so are wholly bound to sinne, and kept vnder the heauy yoke of corrupt lustes. The darkest night hath as much light as they haue grace, the veriest vassall and Gally-slaue hath as muth freedom as the seruants of sinne haue; which should breede in all<note place="margin">Voluntas quoe li bera est in malis idco non est libe rain bonis, quia non libcratur a christo, inquit Anselmus.</note> naturall men a desire to be out of this estate, and a thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse in such as are already pulled out. Thirdly, it serues to confute two sortes of men. First, such as stand for liberty and freedome of will without grace, because wee being before our regeneration altogether bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to sinne: there cannot be therefore in vs, any free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome<note place="margin">Mali habet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertatem cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pabilem.

Secondly, such as hold workes preparatiue in naturall men, disposing them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to grace: whereas they being free from righteousnesse, cannot doe any workes but sinnefull; and sinnes (see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they merite death) cannot dispose them vnto grace and life.</p>

The argument may be thus framed; All Christians stand bound to auoyd that which is filthy, bringing them shame, and that which is harmefull breeding their death: but sin if it be serued and obeyed, it
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:20835:196"/>

Lastly, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, because they haue much flesh and corruption remayning in them, had need to be awed and held to their duties, by fearefull threatnings, where of there is vse, euen for the most godliest to helpe to subdue their sturdy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                     <p>Two wayes; first properly, that affection so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, which appeares in the countenance by blushing: this is natural shame, which commeth either for griese of some dishonesty already done, or for feare of some dishonesty that may be done. This kinde of shame is common both to good and bad, and bringeth forth in them both certain common effects, as to cause them to change their minds, to bee loth to come in presence, to doubt least they doe not please others to discourage them in their duties, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to disquiet them: finally, touching this affection of naturall shame, this counsell is to bee giuen, that it bee so cherished in all, (in young folkes especially, to be made a bridle to keepe from filthy things) as care be taken least it grow vehement and excessiue. Secondly,<note n="*" place="margin">This is mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in the text- Some at al are not ashamed of their sins, as Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites Ierc. 3. 3 Some hauc shame with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce as Cain.

                     <p>First, it causeth the godly to come into the presence of God with reuerence and fear; but it maketh the wicked to shun his presence, as <hi>Adam,</hi> who after he had sinned hid himselfe in the thicket of trees; and <hi>Cain</hi> who hid himselfe after hee had murdered his brother. Secondly, it maketh
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:20835:197"/>
the godly to blame and accuse the sins which they haue done, with detestation and forsaking them; as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten<note place="margin">Ier. 31, 18, 19.</note> of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> Hee was ashamed; but it hardeneth the wicked in their euils. Thirdly, it prouoketh the godlic more vnto dutie, but from the wicked, it taketh al heart of doing any good dutie. Fourthly, it helpes the godly vnto true peace at the last, whereas it is but a torment vnto the wicked, and beginning of their hell. Lastly, the godly are ashamed of God that he should knowe their sinnes; but the wicked are more trobled that the world doth take knowledge of their sinnes.

                     <p>A double aduice vnto Gods Children. First, that it should serue to stay them from committing sin, seeing shame and griefe will follow it. Secondly, when they feele this godly shame and griefe, after any sin vnheede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully done, let them thanke God for such a mercie. Also, vnto the wicked this aduice is to be giuen, that it moue them to hasten their repentance, as they desire to auoide confusion of Conscience for euer in hell, whereof their shame of sinne heere is both a part and an enterance, if it be not looked vnto.</p>

                     <p>The reason is, because shame doth alwayes fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low sinne, so doth not other euils. Secondly, shame fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes vs in euery place, but wee doe not in euery place meete with affictions and other euils. Lastly, if as often as we sinne, God should strike vs with some euill, wee should neuer abide it; therefore, it is best for our profit to haue such a gentle monitour as shame is, to pluck our conscience by the eare, and to iogge vs on the Elbowe; that wee may be stayed from doing euill when wee are tempted, or from going on, if we haue yeelded.</p>

                     <p>It is taken from the end of sinne, which is death; by which is meant the second death, which is called e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall death; in which we may consider two things: first a separation of the whole man from heauenly glorie. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, a destruction of the whole man in hellish paine.</p>

                     <p>This word signifies eyther the cause for which a thing is done, or it is put for the last terme of any thing; so it is vsed heere. For men do not sinne for this cause, that they may dye eternally, yet eternally death is the tearme of the seruice of sinne, which doth determine in fearefull and endlesse destruction. The reason whereof is this: First, because in sinne eternal Iustice is offended. Secondly, wicked men if they might liue alwayes, they would sin eternally, and therefore are worthy at the last to be punished with death eternall.</p>

                     <p>Two Reasons to perswade the seruice of God. One, because the fruite of it is in holinesse in this life: the other, because in the end it brings vnto life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall. These reasons are set downe in forme of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison; three contraries being compared together. As first, God is set against sinne. Secondly, holinesse against
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:20835:198"/>
shame. Lastly, eternall life against death. The summe of all is this; As the seruice of sinne bringes foorth shame heere, and destruction for euer, so holinesse and life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, are the fruites which follow the seruice of God: therefore we stand bound to embrace godlinesse, and to eschue vnrighteousnesse and sin.</p>

                     <p>Praise by encrease of holinesse, as appeareth by this, that it is set against shame howbeit the Apostle chuseth rather to mention holinesse then prayse, because though prayse be due vnto the seruice of God, yet such as exercise themselues in doing the will of God, doe often liue vnder reproach; whereas encrease of inward holinesse, to the praise of the godly in the eies of God and good men, doth
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:20835:198"/>
alwaies follow well doing, as a wholesome fruit for Gods children, when they haue serued God. They bee indeede woorthy of praise, but they may and doe misse of it, at the hands of this vnthankfull world: yet they are sure of this, that the more paines they take in seruing God, the more holy they shall bee, and their conscience more vndefiled: also they shal reape praise amongst all good men, and with God their Father; and this is no small encouragement to make men more earnest in the seruice of God, to consider that they shall bee blessed of God, with greater purity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and more praise among his children. For though Gods childeren are to doe well, not onely nor chiefly for gayning praise or holinesse to themselues, yet these things which will follow of their owne accorde by the ordinance of God (as the shadow doth the body) put some heart and cheerefulnes into them,</p>

For as the children of Israel tasted of the fruite and good thinges of the land of Canaan before they entred into it: so it pleaseth GOD to giue vnto his seruants euen here in this life, some fruite of their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him, to confirme their hope of that reward which they shall haue in the life eternall; hence their graces are likened to first fruites. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</p>

                     <p>Two things, the substance and circumstance, the substance of eternall death hath two parts: First, sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from Gods presence, blisse, and glory, which is called in Scripture, the casting out of his kingdome. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, destruction of body and soule, each to haue se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall torments. The circumstances be sixe; first the place,
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:20835:200"/>
a pit, a dungeon, a prison, a lake. Secondly, compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be the Diuels and his Angels, and the whole route of the Reprobate. Thirdly, darkenesse, blacker and thicker then that of Egypt, there shall bee a continuall night. Fourthly, eternity, euen as long as God endureth, for the worme neuer dyeth, nor the fire neuer goeth out. Fifthly, sinfull concurrences, as hatred of God, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, despaire, &amp;c. Lastly, weeping and gnashing of teeth. This wages though it be due to all sinne, yet it is not rendred to all sin and sinners, because this payment was exacted of Christ, in behalfe of all elect beleeuers, who are discharged from it in their owne persons.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Three: The first whereof doth concerne the vnrepentant, who still serue sinne, to warne them that betimes they shake off such a Lord as sinne is, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders such deadly and damnable wages. For the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance whereof, let them consider these foure thinges: First, that in respect of their sinnes past, it may moue in them a great griefe to thinke that they haue earned and worthily deserued such a stipend. Secondly, a searching out, and particular confession of such sins as haue raig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in them, and made them worthy of so deep a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thirdly, great care and endeuour to refraine from occasions of such wickednesse in time to come: and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to aske earnestly of God forgiuenesse through Christ, and the grace of true repentance. The second instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth concerne such as haue repented, and left the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of sinne; they are first to be thankfull to Christ, who hath freed them from such a wretched wages due to their sinnes, himselfe taking the whole punishment vpon him. Secondly, it prouokes them to humblenesse, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what misery they haue escaped. Thirdly, it doth admonish them neuer to returne againe vnto the seruice of sinne, but to study rather how to please such a redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, which hath for giuen them such a debt: after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the woman, Luke 7, 47. who loued much, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:20835:200"/>
much was forgiuen her. Now the third and last generall instruction, is that which concernes all men both good and bad, who may learne from hence what a dangerous thing sinne is, to which such wofull wages of due doth belong. Secondly, what a terrible thing Gods<note place="margin">To the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing penitent finners, all sinnes be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, and all be mortal to the vebelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers.</note> iustice is, which doth repay such bitter recompence to such as offend against it. Thirdly, what cause there is for all Christians to tremble at the least motion of sinne in themselues, and to auoide al occasions of sinning with all their power. Finally, this proueth all sinnes in their owne nature, to be mortall and none to be veniall, for he speaks of sins generally, that death is their wages.</p>

                     <p>They haue these two seuerall readings; first, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life is the gift of God, and then they teach vs this lesson, that eternall life doth follow our good workes and holy life, as death followes sinne, yet not as a due debt, but as a free gift. The second reading is thus: The grace of God is eternall life; and then it hath this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that true holinesse which God of his grace and free gift giueth vs, is eternall life; (that is to say,) leadeth
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:20835:201"/>
and bringeth vnto eternall life, as a way bringeth a man to the place where he would be; and as one must passe through the running place to the goale, so by holinesse must all true Christians passe vnto life eternall: this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the fitter and better reading, more agreeing vnto the phrase and scope.</p>

                     <p>The full fruition of celestiall ioyes, without any possibility of loosing them, so long as God himselfe liues. And therefore are they called eternall; because there is no end of them: and they haue the name of life put vpon them, to teach of what great value and price they bee; of all earthly things, life beeing most pleasant and precious.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, we learne that our saluation is Gods free gift, both as touching the beginning and end of it, and comes not by our merites eyther in whole or in part. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Christians must encourage themselues to leade a godly life; notwithstanding all hinderances in their way, from themselues, from the world, and Sathan; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a holy life being continued in, will at the length bring to a life eternall. Thirdly, seeing godlinesse of life doth by the ordinance of God necessarily leade vnto eternall life, and they which do liue godlily, may know that they doe so: heereof it followeth that all the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haue certainty and good assurance of their owne sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; if one may know that he liueth holily, thereby he may know that he shall liue happily.</p>

                     <p>To teach vs that all merite is to be sought out of our selues, and to be found only in the person of Christ Iesus, who by that which hee himselfe hath suffered and done, hath fully deserued life eternall for all beleeuers which liue vprightly; to whom therefore all praise ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory is due.

                     <p>The purpose of <hi>Paul</hi> is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme &amp; illustrate that Paradox or strange Doctrine propounded in the former Chapter, of beeing not vnder the Law, but vnder grace, which haply some of the Iewes might haue taken, as if the Apostle had bin an enemy to the knowledge and obedience of the Law: therefore, now he sheweth how our freedome from the Law is to be vnderstood, and vpon what groundes and reasons it is founded. This is shewed and declared by the similitude of ciuill marriage, wherein the woman during natural life, is obliged to the Husband, 1. to be his, or to him onely, 2. not to depart from him, 3. nor to marry with another; but the husband being dead, she is free, being, 1. his no more; 2. and may (without guilt of Adultery) marry to another. 3. to bring forth fruite to another, to the second man. So all the elect before new byrth, are in bondage to sin, to which they bring forth Children, that is euill workes by the force of the Lawe;<note place="margin">Of this free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome therebe three reasons in verse 4.</note> but after regeneration, the vigour and coaction of the Law ceaseth (in part at least) and they 1. are free, being dead to the Law. and 2. married vnto Christ. 3. do now bring forth good workes (as children) to God. <hi>Paul</hi> exemplieth in the woman, rather then in the man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause her Obligation and bond is straighter toward the man, then of him toward her (for by the Lawe the man was suffered to giue a Bill of Diuorce to the woman, so was it not on the contrary) also because his meaning was to compare vs to the wife.</p>

                     <p>That it may bee free and lawfull for Christians to passe ouer to a second marriage, to bee ioyned to another husband; that is, to Christ being dead and raysed againe: and for very good reason it is, that the Apostle after the death of Christ, doth make mention of the resurrection of Christ. First, because vppon his resurrection dependeth the force, efficacy, and fruite of his death, which had no whit benefited the Church, if he had not been raised from the dead. Secondly, because Christ being now raised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to life, and raigning in glory, he is able to do towards his Church, and euery member of it, all husbandly duties of protection, supporting, instructing, blessing, enriching her with graces and gifts of al sorts.

Secondly, the great dignity of euery true Christian which hath his sinnes taken away touching<note place="margin">Note that Christ dead and raised, is called God absolutely.</note> the guilt, by forgiuenes, and touching power and tiranny, by mortification; such a one is the spouse of Christ, and is one with him and with all his graces, and liues by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which enableth him to do good workes acceptable to

                     <p>It is so, as the chiefe effect of naturall marriage, is the begetting of Children, whome the Hebrewes call <hi>the fruit of the wombe, Psal.</hi> 127. and 128. So the maine fruit of our spirituall mariage, is the bringing forth such fruites as are commanded in the law. This doeth first of all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage vs to labour in euery good worke, because God will accept it as a pleasant fruit. Secondly, it reprooueth such as are either vtterly and wholly, or partly vnfruitefull in the workes of righteousnesse: for as the barrennesse of the wombe was a reproach amongst the Iewes; so barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in good workes is much more reprochfull to a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian who is elected, redeemed, called, ioyned &amp; espoused to Christ, sanctified also to this end to glorify God by fruits of new obedience.</p>

sinne cannot offer any force to the will, whatsoeuer the will doth, it doth it freely, and without constraint; yet it is true that sinne doeth exercise tyranny ouer the vngodly, and holds them bound so, as they cannot but fulfil the lusts os it.

                     <p>First, that it is not possible we should serue God and doe things pleasing to him, till we bee changed and renued.

This obiection ariseth from this, that <hi>Paul</hi> had taught that the affections of sinne were by the Law, verse 5. which some aduersary (belike) taking hold of it, did so wrest it, or might so turne it, as if hee had taught that the the Law did perswade to sinne; and were the proper efficient cause of it; which contumeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and reproachfull slander, would haue touched God the Author.</p>

                     <p>These two: First, that no Doctrine can bee so sound, nor so warily deliuered, but malicious personnes will cauill and wrest it to a contrary meaning. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from an hatred they beare vnto their teachers, which causeth them that they distaste their doctrine, and carpe at it. Secondly, the Ministers of Christ must bee careful, and able not only to propound the truth sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but to defende it against wicked obiections and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uillations: otherwise, there is danger least weake and vnstable mindes be peruerted and drawn from the truth by such as speak against it: our nature being more prone to suck in error, then to receiue the truth.</p>

                     <p>By argumentation and sound reason fetched &amp; taken from the contrary. As thus: The Law cannot bee the cause to beget and perswade sinne, for that it is the Instrument to discouer it, and make sinne knowne vnto vs; detecting the deceits and assaults of such an enemie, that wee beware of it, as <hi>Paules</hi> Kinsman detected the treason of the Iewes against <hi>Paul.</hi> Vpon which detecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<note place="margin">Act: 23, 16.</note> of sinne, if sinne do the more rage and rebell in vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the will of God; this is not to be imputed to the Law, but to our corrupt Nature, which growes worse, &amp; more fierce by that which should restraine and helpe it. All this the Apostle proues by his owne example: for he confesseth that there were some sinnes which hee knew not to be sinnes, till the Law did reueale them vnto him to be so; whereof he giues instance in lustes, or in the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill motions of the minde, suddenly conceiued vvithout the consent of our will; of which he saith, That had not the Law told him they had beene sinnes, saying; <hi>Thou shalt not Lust,</hi> hee had not mistrusted them, or thought them to be such greeuous matters, as to bee offences of God, and to deserue damnation. <hi>I had not knowne lust, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Lord had saide, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>Two thing; first, it is lawfull for the Ministers of the worde, to report what they haue learned by their owne experience, in the matter of sin and saluation: this is a great helpe and confirmation of the hearers, if it bee truely and

First, it maketh appeare vnto vs,<note place="margin">How the law dcteineth sin.</note> what is euill and sin, and what is not.

to the committers of it, to wit, no lesse then euerlasting destruction in hell, after all the miseries of this life. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it giues a feeling of sinne in our hearts, troubling our Consciences by some certaine byting and sting. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentall knowledge is that which is chiefely meant heere: where we are further to note, that howsoeuer all Lawes, both ciuill, ceremoniall, and iudicial, as the law of nature also serueth to manifest sinne; yet the morall Law of God, being written by <hi>Moyses,</hi> and rightlie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, doth performe this office of reuealing sin, most fully and feelingly; because it striketh at the roote, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering<note place="margin">The Law be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

Fourthly, this directeth vs how to reade and heare the Law with fruite, namely; when wee finde out some thing by it which must bee forgiuen by mercie, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of or amended by grace. Lastly, it serueth to pul downe our stomackes and hearts, by the viewe of our owne sinfull estate, to force vs vnto Christ, and to make much of his grace and merites.

when he saith [He had not knowne Lust, &amp;c.] As also, what Law he speaketh of?</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>He meaneth the morall Law or ten Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as is plaine by the instance of [Lust] which is sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden or condemned in euery one of them, as the root whence springeth all other sinnes. As for knowledge, he meaneth both speculatiue and experimentall, but rather this; so as the sence is this; I had neuer vnderstood lust to be a sinne at all, or felt it to be so grieuous a sinne (as now I doe) without the helpe and light of Gods Lawe, which forbiddeth Lust. Hence wee are put in minde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, how diligently the Law of God is to bee learned and weighed of vs, seeing without it, the hidden sinnes of our nature cannot bee espyed and knowne; nor the force of sin so throughly felt, as to enforce vs to Christ.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>But what Lust may it be, that this our Text mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth? for there be sundry sorts of Lusts, some be good lusts which he cannot meane, and sinful lusts be not all of one kind. Shew vs which of them is vnderstood heere?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>It is true (as ye say) for there be naturall Lustes, when things tending to preseruation of our own nature are desired; there is also a spiritual lust (an hungring &amp; thirsting for iustice) which is a desire of heauenly things that come from the Spirite; and also, there is carnall &amp; sinfull Lust, which is of things contrary vnto God. These be meant heere, but not all these. For of sinnefull lustes, there be sundry kindes. As first Originall lust, which is the fountaine, roote, and spring of all other sins, being that which is called byrth-sinne, or corruption of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. This Originall Lust, is an impotencie of mans heart, whereby it is inordinately disposed to this or that euill. Secondly, actuall lust, which is euerie euill motion and desire of the soule against the law of God. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds as a fruite from the former, Rom. 6, 12. of which, there are two degrees: the one, is an euill motion of the minde suddenly conceiued without consent of will: this is called voluntarie Lust. The other is an euill motion,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:20835:214"/>
which goeth together with consent, and is ioyned with purpose and deliberation, lames 1, 15. This is called vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary lust, because it hath the consent of our will, and is not onely in desire, but in resolution to effect it, if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion serue. Now our Text doth not speake of our vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary lusts, which are consented vnto by our will, and resolued vpon. First, because without the morall Law <hi>Paul</hi> might know these lusts to be sinne by the light of naturall reason, as many Heathens did.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, by that which followes in this Chapter, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares he speakes of such lusts as be resisted, and irkesome to a godly minde, which doe leade the Saints captiue, euen against their will, making them cry out (<hi>O miserable men:</hi>) and therefore it is an originall lust, which is the prauity of nature disposed to euil, (which is meant here,) and also the first degree of actuall lusts, to wit, such as go before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent: the moral law being rightly vnderstood of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, gaue him light to see that those lustes were sinnes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing eternal death, which before he knew the law he did not perceiue, or once surmise it to be so, or to sticke so deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his nature, and so to make him obnoxious to Gods wrath.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>The first is this, the miserable estate wherein all men stand by <hi>Adams</hi> fall, hauing their nature wholly poysoned and corrupted by sin, Iusting after euill things alone; in so much as if we should neuer thinke, speake, nor doe euill, yet our very corruption of nature beeing the breach of Gods eternall law, maketh vs guilty of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall wrath. Secondly, our euill desires and motions,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Paul</hi> calleth lust sinne, and it hath diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Law of the mind. <hi>August.</hi>

                     <p>First, euery one must see that they haue need of the death and bloud-shedde of Christ, euen for the least
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:20835:214"/>
vaine and sinnefull thought or imagination, yea for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their infected dead nature. Secondly, that euery one must be humbled, mourne, and with sighes craue pardon for such thoughts, and for their naturall inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to sinne. Thirdly, all Christians stand bound, not onely to take care and heed of their words and workes,<note place="margin">Lust formed or vnformed, before or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter consent, is to be repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted.</note> but euen of their thoughts and desires; for there must a Conscience be made, not onely of what men speake and doe, but what men thinke and desire. Fourthly, it serues to reprooue such as doe thinke euill thoughts to be free: also such as know euill thoughts to be sinnes, and yet la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour<note place="margin">Concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence is not meerely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, but is morall and spirituall, and resists grace; so it is sinne.</note> not to bridle and mortifie them: and lastly it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes the Papists, which affirme that lust because it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoluntary and naturall, is not sinne, vntill it be consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to by the will, till then it is but <hi>fomes peccati,</hi> &amp; set <hi>ad agonem.</hi>

                     <p>That in elect persons baptized, and by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite effectually regenerated, concupiscence doth remaine as a sinne and a vicious thing; the reason is, because of it is written, <hi>Thou shalt not lust:</hi> which shewes it to be sinne, else it should not be forbid, nor called by the name of sinne, as it is often in this Chapter, yea in <hi>Paul</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, as verse 17: not alone for that it is the effect of sinne, as the writing is called ones hand, or the cause of sinne, as death is tearmed pale; but for that it is properly and truely sinne, being a Rebell against the gouernment of the Spirite in the minde of godly persons, Chap, 7, 23. and causeth death which springeth onely from sinne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly taken, Rom. 5, 13, 14, &amp;c. Indeed it is forgiuen the elect touching guilt, but the fault and spot is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued, as the Conscience of the holiest persons may and doe witnesse to them.

mans corrupt nature being irritated, prouoked, and stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vp by the prohibitions of the Law once manifestly knowne, doth snatch and take occasion thereby to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more fierce, and to breake out into more foule sins. And this is it which is meant by the word [<hi>Wrought</hi>] for the meaning is, that mans corrupt nature by the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Law, which condemneth it, in stead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amended thereby, doth beget and bring foorth sin and sinfull desires more abundantly.

Secondly, that Christians must reck on it a great mercy of God, to haue the law truely expounded, and wisely applyed to themselues, that they may come to feele their sins and their owne miserable condition, as they may bee prouoked by that meanes to seeke a remedy.

                     <p>Thus: when wee begin to knowe the law rightly, we see and feele our sinnes which before wee did not, and that thereby wee are woorthily adiudged to damnation in hell fire. This cannot bee carnestly thought on, but that it will bring vs to some taste of destruction, in which respect though wee doe liue in our bodies, yet we are said to bee slaine by sin and to be dead. For as a malefactor condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, who by feare &amp; feeling of his death approaching (loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for it euery minute with terrour,) may be said to tast of death, and to die before he be dead: so it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> being vnregenerate; and so it is with all the elect, when the law hath effectually conuicted them of death through sin, they haue a sence of death eternall, which breedeth great heauines and disquietnes in their minds.</p>

The reason hereof is, because till men be brought to a through-sight &amp; sence of their own dsm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, they will neuer secke after Christ nor desire him:
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:20835:219"/>
without which they can neuer finde him nor haue him: God hauing so ordained it, that by seeking we shall find him.

                     <p>That sinne is a deceitfull thing may appeare by these three wayes: First, by the testimony of Scripture<note place="margin">By authority.</note> as Heb. 3, 12, 13. Take heed least any of you be hardened through the deceitfulnesse of sinne: also in Ephe. 4, 22. the lusts of sinne are called deceiueable lusts: now what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer God saith is deceitfull, must needs be so, for hee cannot lye. Secondly, by the example first of <hi>Paul,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing that sinne deceiued him, he being very wise, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,<note place="margin">Example.</note> and heedfull. Secondly, of <hi>Peter,</hi> who was deceiued by his sinfull presumption. Thirdly, of <hi>Salomon</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> by incontinency. Fourthly, of <hi>Iudas,</hi> who was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued by couetousnesse. Lastly of <hi>Herod</hi> by pride. Thirdly, by reason because it is the brood of the Diuell,<note place="margin">Reason.</note> that olde Serpent, full of subtilty, who deceiued the whole world by his guile and craft: the Child being like his father, such damme such broode. Second reason: sinne is in quality contrary to holinesse, therefore as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse hath sincerity and truth, so sinne hath deceit and guile annexed to it. Lastly, seeing it makes our hearts deceitfull, therefore it selfe must needs be full of deceite. For that which maketh a thing to be such, it selfe is more

such. <hi>Quod facit tale, id est magis tale. Aristot.</hi>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, by making men thinke that they are aliue and happy, when they are dead and miserable thorough sinne. Secondly, by causing them to neglect their inward thoughts and lusts, resting in outward obedience onely, as if that were enough, and could iustifie them. Thirdly, by insinuating it selfe into their harts, becomming more pleasant and delightfull to them; by the prohibitions of the Law, forbidding and condemning it. By these three waies especially, was <hi>Paul</hi> deceiued with sin. Fourthly, by blinding our iudgement, by putting out the eyes of our minde, that we should not be able to see it to be a sin in our selues, which we see to be a sin in others; &amp; not to be a fault in particular, which men do know to be a fault in the generall. As the couetous, proud, malicious, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn couetousnes, pride, hatred in general, yet perceiue not that their owne actions sauour of these vices Fiftly, sin perswades me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that the things which the law forbids are good &amp; commodious for them; as some kind oflyes, and some litle breaking of the Saboth, and vsury &amp; such like sin, dooth often put on the name and countenaunce of vertue; as pride of cleanlinesse, niggardnesse of thrift, great swearing and reuenge of manhood &amp; courage, &amp;c. Seauenthly, it turneth away our thoughts from thinking earnestly vpon the punishment due to sin. Eightly, when we do any good, it maketh vs ascribe it to our selues, and
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:20835:221"/>
to think that we haue kept the Law. Ninthly, our sinfull Nature frames it selfe glad to heare the Law, &amp; yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually drawes from the obedience of it. Lastly, it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swadeth vs, that there is more ease &amp; pleasure in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our lusts, then in obeying Gods Law.

Also, such as knowing this, yet suspect it not, but are secure; not prouiding and arming themselues against the slights of sin. Secondly, it teacheth all men what need they haue of wisedome and warinesse, and all good circumspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, considering what a deceitful enemy they haue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their owne bosome, and how many wisemen haue bin deceiued; and how easie a thing it is to be deceiued, and what danger it is to be deceiued: therefore watch, take heede, and pray continually.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It is called Iust, first, because it is righteous, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing<note place="margin">Iust.</note> in it no wrong or iniquity. Secondly, it teacheth iust things. Thirdly, it proceedeth from a iust God. 4. It is able to iustifie such as perfectly keepe it. Fiftly, it iustly denounceth death to them that break it. Also, it is called<note place="margin">Good.</note> good: First, because it liketh, alloweth, and beareth with no euil. Secondly, it she weth vs euery good way which we are to walk. And lastly, it hath promises of many good things, both temporal and eternal; for this life and for a better.</p>

                     <p>Thus: It is holy, because holinesse towards God is taught in the first Table of the Law; Iust, because Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice towards our Neighbor is taught in the second Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and because the good and perfect way is taught in both the Tables; as also, God the chiefe good, who and what he is, and what he willeth.</p>

Secondly, it doth admonish vs with delight, reuerence, and loue to thinke and speake, to reade and heare it, beeing so highly praised of Gods owne mouth. Thirdly, it prooues the Scripture of the Law to bee inspired of God, whose Image it beares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like himself, in his most glorious properties. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Deut 4, 8, 5.</note> it commendeth to vs, the great mercie of God, &amp; sets forth the great dignity of his people, in hauing a Law so holy and iust giuen vnto them. Fiftly, it encourageth all Christians to be verie studious in the Lawe, to learne it, and carefully to practise it, being a rule so right &amp; pure. Sixtly, it bewrayeth what a filthy and foule thing sinne is, that is contrary vnto so holy a Law. Seauenthly, it informes all men, that they ought to beare with, and to brooke the seuere Discipline of the Law, because it is good and iust. Eightly, heereby all men must be warned to stand with Gods Law against their dearest lustes, to condemne whatsoeuer the Lawe condemneth, and to praise whatsoeuer the law praiseth. Ninthly, here is a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne for Teachers, how to frame their Doctrine, to see that it be holy, iust, and good; aswel as for hearers how to frame their conuersation, to look to it, that it be such as the Law is; for till it be such, it is neuer holy &amp; iust. Tenthly, that wee must haue in honour and estimation, not onely the word of the Law, but euerie portion of it, it being throughout like it selfe. Lastly, we see here what
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:20835:223"/>
to iudge of the Gospell, namely, that it is a Doctrine ful of goodnesse, Iustice, and holinesse, woorthy of all loue and obedience. For if the Law be holy, sure the Gospel is no lesse. For it is from the same Authour, penned by as holy instrumentes and Secretaries, containing matter most Diuine and holy, euen redemption by Christ; and not onely tending vnto, but seruing to make vs holy, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting it in vs; being the power of God to saluation, &amp; so to Sanctification, which is one part of Saluation, as Iustification is the other, which wee attaine by the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell onely, Rom. 1, 16, 17.</p>

                     <p>To cleare the Lawe from a new slaunder, which might by cauillers be cast vppon it. The flaunder was, that <hi>Paul</hi> in his Doctrine did make the Law a verie pestilent thing, the very cause of death to himself, whom it had slaine, verse 8. The which slander he doth wipe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and discharge himselfe of it thus: First by denying it [<hi>God forbid.</hi>] Secondly, by turning the blame of death vpon sinne [<hi>For Sinne.</hi>] As if hee should say, it is not the Lawe which is made death, but it is sinne which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets death. Thirdly, he proues by reason, that the Lawe cannot be the cause of death, for that it is spirituall (that is) ordering or framing a man to spirituall obedience, &amp; to liue conformably vnto God; which if any could doe, they should not dye, but become spirituall and liue for euer: therefore in it selfe it must needs be an holie and a good thing.</p>

                     <p>First, that a malicious Cauiller, wil neuer make an end of obiecting against the trueth, an vnsanctified wit is euer vnsatiable. Such as enquire and obiect sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

                     <p>Secondly, that the Doctrine of the Gospell, doth lye open vnto many slanders of wicked men, who because they will not beleeue sound Doctrine and obey it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are iustly giuen ouer to the spirit of calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; against such men must bee armed. Thirdly, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth the Ministers of Christ, not onely to lay downe their Doctrine soundly and plainly; but wisely to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see what accusations may bee brought in against it, and how to remoue them; for as they may assure themselues that Satan will sifte all the corners of his wit, to deuise slanders against the truth; so it behooueth them to bee prudent, to forecast and preuent it.</p>

                     <p>That no man (especially a Minister) must suffer a slander, especially in the matter of Doctrine, falsely to be fastened vpon him, because the discredite of a Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher in matter of Doctrine, is the endaungering of the soules of the hearer.

                     <p>That sinne wrought deatl in him thorough that
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:20835:224"/>
which is good (to wit the lawe,) the meaning whereof is twofold. First, that his sinne the more the law forbid it, the more it did rise vp against the lawe, and so wrapt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe more deeply in death and damnation; as an vntained Horse, the more hee is curbed, the more he rageth. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the law shewed him his sin and made him feele it, and that by the desert of it, hee was vnder Gods wrath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged to hell fire; vpon the apprehension and taste wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, his heart was smitten with deadly heauines. It fareth with him, as with a man condemned to dye, and respited two or three dayes, he feeles death euery houre though he be aliue: So <hi>Paul</hi> being vnder eternall death through sin, and made by the lawe to see and feele somuch, hee was by this meanes as a flaine and dead man; as one that hath the axe ouer his neck, and euery moment looks for the mortal blow.</p>

                     <p>At what time was it, that sinne through the lawe had wrought this death in him, seeing it is playne by Scripture, that while he was a Pharisy, hee was farre from thinking himselfe in any such woefull and deadly estate: because it is witnessed of him, that hee liued vnblameably. Phil. 3. 6. keeping a good conscience, Acts 23, 1. profitting in the religion of the Iewes aboue his fellowes. Gal. 1, 14. In somuch that he rather took him selfe to be iust by the keeping of the law, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> feared death by the breaking of it: therefore shew me at what time it was, that the lawe wrought in him this feeling of death, by reason of his transgressions aginst it?</p>

                     <p>This hapned vnto him (vppon all presumptions) euen a little afore his conuersion, after that Christ had met him in the way as hee went to <hi>Damascus,</hi> and had begun to humble him by terrible actions, words, and sights, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting<note place="margin">Acts 9. 2, 3, 4.</note> him ouer for further direction vnto <hi>Ananias.</hi> By whose ministry he was broght and made to see two things (amongst many others.) First, that the good woorkes which he did before his conuersion, they did not proceed from faith and charity, and therefore in the sight of God, they were no better then sins. Secondly, he was instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:20835:224"/>
to know the meaning of that commandement, which forbiddeth lust; to wit, that all sodaine motions and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires of the minde, deserue damnation in strictnesse of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice: now being made to perceiue this, that his best righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse was but iniquity with God, and that his heart had beene full of euill affections and motions in the sight of God; howsoeuer his life had beene without blame in the sight of men: these things (I say) being beleeued and eainestly thought of, with application to himselfe, of the threatnings of the law, against his inward and secret cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and hipocrisie, brought him to see and feele him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be in the case of a fellon condemned to dye, euen a most miserable and dead man, without the grace of God in Iesus Christ; this was the beginning of his conuersion.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Two, first that it is a mans owne sin which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth and begetteth his death, the law onely sheweth a man his sinne, conuict him of it, and maketh him feele himselfe guilty of death; prouoking him by his own fault, to doe that which shall more deserue condemnation. For as an earthly King hearing of some subiects apt to mutiny and rebellion, giues his commaundement to them to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare assembling, to weare no weapons vppon paine of death; hereby they are made the more rumultuous, are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, conuicted as guilty of the breach of the Kings edict, and therefore executed, whereof their rebellious mind is the proper cause, the kings commandement onely an accidentall cause: so it is with the law, it is but the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall cause of our destruction, which properly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from our sins. Secondly, we are taught, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer God meaneth to bring to his Sonne Christ, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy his righteousnesse and life, they must feele their owne death denounced by the law against the desert of their sins; for howsoeuer there were in <hi>Pauls</hi> conuersion somethings extraordinary, yet this is ordinary to him with other elect sinners. First, to be killed by the law in the sence of their
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:20835:225"/>
sinnes and damnation, ere they be made aliue by the grace of the Gospell.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, to comfort them which haue got a tast of their owne destruction, and are troubled and humbled by it; such are in a good way to Christ, as a corasiue or potion when it smarts, workes a good signe. Secondly, it serueth sharply to reproue such as are forward to draw the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of life vnto themselues, before the lawe hath slayne and wrought a sence of death in them: it is all one, as if they would haue their wound or sore healed without lanching, their disease or sicknes cured without phisick.</p>

                     <p>That it brings to open knowledge the malice of our naturall sinnne and prauity, which consists heerein; in that it doeth abuse perniciously such a good thing as the lawe is, to the encreasing of sinne, and to the woorking of death. This may bee set forth by the comparison of such stubborn diseases, as are made the worse by such remedies as are applyed to heale them: euen such a vile thing sinne is, which taketh occasion to breake out more vehemently by that meanes, which was giuen to restrayn it. And it is in this sence saide of sinne, that it is made by the lawe out of measure sinfull: partly, because by the knowledge of the law, sinne which was hid before, doeth now shewe it selfe to bee more grieuous; and partly because by the restraynt of the law, it doth rage more vnmeasurably.</p>

                     <p>First, because it is not giuen by men, but God himselfe by his Spirit was the inditer of it. Secondly,<note place="margin">In respect of Author.</note> because it reacheth not to the outward man onely, but<note place="margin">Of manner.</note> to the most inward motions of our minde and will, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring<note place="margin">Of obedience</note> obedience from our very spirits and thoughts, yea requiring a spirutually euen a perfect and Angelicall obedience in soule and body.

But this property of (Spirituall) cannot be affirmed of the whole law. For the ceremoniall law stood in bodily rites. The iudiciall law did respect out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward acts.

                     <p>First, heere we learne a difference betweene the ciuill lawes of men, and the lawes of God; the former take no knowledge of thoughts, except they be vttered in words and actes, the latter doth. Secondly, one may keepe all the lawes of men, and yet be a very vicious and wicked person, whereas Gods law teacheth to follow all vertue, and to shunne all vice. Thirdly, it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to conforme a mans selfe to Gods own law, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in outward actions onely, without internall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Fourthly, it reprooues such as thought the Law of <hi>Moyses</hi> to require no more then externall duties: as the Pharisies expounded the Law. See Math. 5. Fifthly, it prooues to vs, that the Law is vnpossible to bee kept of vs, who cannot in this flesh attaine such exacte puritie;<note place="margin">Indeed wee should be spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and free from death, it we would do the Law.</note> and so reprooues the Papists, who teach that we may me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite by workes, and doe more then the Law commands, cue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> works supererogatory. Sixtly, it helps to vnderstand the true meaning of the Law, that in the forbidding or commanding of outward workes euill or good, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids and commands the very first thoughts and desires of those workes. Seauenthly, it doth admonish all men as they would please God, to haue more care about the ordering of the inward motions, then of the outward actions. Lastly, it must warne vs with earnest prayer to craue helpe of God, to strengthen vs by his Spirite to giue obedience to the Law, in some measure of truth and sincerity.</p>

                     <p>First, that it is a good fruite and sure note of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate person, vnfaignedly and ingeniously to confesse their sinfull infirmities, wherein there is a great difference betweene the childe of God, and those that bee but hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites: for an hypocrite doeth commonly deny, defend, or extenuate his sinne, or confesseth it more out of the feare of punishment, then for the griefe of the offence, or out of hope of pardon: but the Children of God doe the quite contrary, for they freely accuse themselues out of a loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their sinnes, with trust of the forgiuenesse of it by Christ.</p>

                     <p>What reason moueth them thus to do?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, because it is the high and ready way to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, the promise whereof is made onely to a faithfull and sound confession, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1, 9. Secondly, because this kinde of confession is both gratefull to God, in that it is commaunded of him, and doeth render vnto him his due praise. Thirdly, it is a true testimony and marke, that our repentance is not counterfet, and hypocritical, but hearty<note place="margin">As Salomon and before him his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dauid did.

Lastly, because it brings true peace vnto the conscience of a sinner: These reasons and grounds are sufficient to moue the childeren of God, euen openly and publikely to accuse themselues when need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires; as appeares in the example of this our Apostle, who to the end hee might yeelde due praise to God and to his lawe, and giue vnto the faithfull an example of true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, doth in this place publikly accuse himself of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full corruption, and of bondage to sinne in part: for as hee doth here accuse himselfe generally of sinne, so hee doeth elsewhere charge himselfe with sundry speciall foule vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by name, see 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1, 13. The like did <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> and innumerable others, whereof mention is made in Sacred story.</p>

                     <p>First, it ministreth great comfort to such as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and feeling their sinne, are ready in vprightnesse to accuse and condemne themselues before God and men, as neede requires; for it declares them to be the new-borne children of God, because none saue they can do this. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it instructeth all Christians as they tender Gods glory, or their owne Saluation, frankely to confesse those their sinnes with their mouths, of which they haue a sence in their hearts, and a checke in their conscience. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it affords sharpe reproofe vnto such as deny their sins, or confesse them constrainedly, for this argueth that they are yet in the power of sinne, seruants to their lusts, void
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:20835:228"/>
of the Spirite of grace, wherewith the Children of God are led; and vtterly carelesse both of Gods glory &amp; their owne good and other mens, whom by the example of their humility they might edifie.</p>

                     <p>Men in Scripture are called carnall in a double sence. First, the children of this world, meere natural men, are called carnall absolutely because they are in the flesh,
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:20835:228"/>
and walke after the flesh, sauouring the things of the flesh, being wholy carnall and sinfull in all their wayes, serning diuers lusts and pleasures. Secondly, the children of God beeing renued by the Spirit, are called carnall after a sort, either comparatiuely, because they haue more flesh and corruption then grace, as the Corinthians, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3, 2. or else partially, or in part, because they are still obnoxious to the infirmities of the flesh; and haue not the Spirite and grace, without euill concupiscence and lustes, as <hi>Paul</hi> was, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7, 22.</p>

                     <p>That he was captiue to sin under the power of it, as a seruant or slaue bought with a price, is in the power of him that bought himꝭ for it is a borrowed speech from such tyrants as buy others with their money, whome they may vse as slaues at their will. Into this bondage we come two wayes. First, by nature being borne such. Secondly, by election and choise, willingly yeelding our selues vnder this dominion of sinne: euery meere man is the seruant of sin both these wayes, beeing the children of wrath by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and afterwards willingly obeying the lusts of sin.</p>

                     <speaker>Sylas.</speaker>
                     <p>There is a double bondage to this tyrant sinne, voluntary as in <hi>Ahab,</hi> who solde himself to do cull in the sight of the Lord: Such a bondman was <hi>Paul</hi> before his conuersion in al thinges, and readily obeying sin.

                     <p>First, all Gods children must take knowledge of their estate, that though they are regenerate, yet they are still carnall, sold vnder sin, both in regard of originall sin, and actuall infirmities. Secondly, let them continually make faithfull prayers vnto God for the ayde of his grace, for to maister the flesh. Thirdly, it behooueth them to be watchfull, not onely hauing such an enemy as sin in their own bosome, but through sinne the deuill ready to mingle himselfe with all their thoughts. Fourthly, let euery man suspect euery thing that commeth of himselfe, least it smel and rellish of the flesh; not easily approuing ought that is pleasing vnto him without serious and narrow examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Fiftly, whensoeuer we are afflicted, let vs know that there may be just cause giuen by vs, though wee cannot see it; and therefore forbeare to complaine of God. Sixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, seeing regenerate men are so bound to sinne, that they cannot vse that liberty of will which they haue by grace, how much lesse is there any power of free will in men vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate? Lastly, let the reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of our wofull capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity, cause vs to strlue and sigh after perfect liberty: and in the meane space to walk watchfully and humbly, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and men, and in our owne eies: for wee are like to captiues which after hard bondage haue some liberty, yet in signe of captiuity, carry an yron chaine or a fetter to clog them: so are Gods best children freed, as they beare stil the clog and chain of corruption for their better hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and continuall exercise.</p>

The first assault, is, that he found in himselfe two contrary grounds of his actions, to wit; Originall sinne, still abiding in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and his regenerate wil wrestling like the two twins in <hi>Rebeccaes</hi> wombe; the one made him hate God, and do that which is euill; the other, caused him to hate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and to will that which is good, vnto verse 18. The second assault was, that, when his purpose and will was good, it had no good effect but a quite repugnant and contrary effect, verse 19, 20. The third is, that hee felt two contrary Lawes enforcing him; the one, vnto ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse and life, the other, vnto sinne and death, Verse 21, 22, 23.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First the Children of God in their regeneration do not receiue fulnesse of grace to do wel. For then they should do nothing which they allow not, but their will and their deed should accord, both should be perfectly good.

<pb n="453" facs="tcp:20835:230"/>
in this life cannot sinne, as Familists. Secondly, it admonisheth al men to finde out and acknowledge their imperfections with griefe, and to striue towardes perfection. Lastly, it doth serue to comfort such, as doe labour vnder sinful infirmities and defects. For this was the Apostles case. How much lesse maruail, if it proue so with others inferiour to him.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That it is a good sign of a regenerate man, when not onely conscience checketh, and iudgment disliketh, but his heart dissalloweth and is displeased with the euil he doth; because this bewraieth, that they are not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnder the power of originall sinne, but haue another beginning and ground of their actions, euen grace and the holy Spirit of God, from whence comes that hatred of euil, and desire of good.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, it proues them to be meere naturall &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate men, who do allow and be pleased with their sinnes that be in themselues and in others. Secondly, it admonisheth the godly of their dutie, which is not to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but with hatred to condemne euery sinful thing in themselues, euen to the least motion and lust, not at any hand after it is knowne bearing with it, but stirring vp the heart to detest and lament it with godly sorrow, in regard it is an offence to God.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That the elect of God being regenerate, they are neuer so giuen ouer, as to sinne with their whole wil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this is true of them all, that they allow not the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill which they doe: so that in all their euils and sinnes, there is some striuing in their will against them though it be but faintly and in great feeblenesse, as it happeneth in great tentation.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>By this reason, because both in the leauing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:20835:231"/>
good, and in the doing of euill, hee offended not willingly, but with a detestation and loathing. For the euill which he did was hatefull to him, and his will was to doe the good hee could not doe; not that <hi>Paul</hi> was compelled vnto euill, but that hee consented not to it with his whole will; his heart being now changed and made confermable to the law in part.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, we learne that the godly cannot doe al the good they would, because sinne hindreth them; and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that they cannot doe all the euill as their lustes would, because they haue grace to hate and resist euill. For the Spirite lusts against the flesh. as the flesh doth lust against the Spirite. Gal. 5. 17. Obserue further out of this whole verse, that it is farre from the godly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, extenuate, and cloake their sinne; they abhorre it and that out of a reuerence toward the law, vnto which their sinne is contrary: againe, in holy persons there bee beginnings of their doings, one whereby they wil good, and will not euill, called the innerman, law of the mind, Spirite, &amp;c. the other whereby they are drawne from good vnto euill.</p>

                     <p>That place is to be vnderstood of precepts and rules giuen foorth for pollicy, and gouernment of Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For which purposes the very Heathen forbid vices and command honest things pertaining to ciuill life: and not of their daily conuersation, wherein they were great sinners, eyther openly, or secretly, as <hi>Paul</hi> accusech them before, Chapters, 1, 2. Besides in their common life they did some good things, and eschued some euill, out of vaine-glory to get praise of men.</p>

                     <p>It is true, they were displeased for their sinnes,
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:20835:232"/>
not for that they allowed Gods lawe, which condemned their sinnes; but because they begun to feele the discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities and calamities of their sins, and did feare further destruction. Secondly, they were so displeased with the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils they did against the law, that they had no care to doe the good commanded in the law, as regenerate men haue; and that out of conscience and obedience of the lawe, and in one thing as well as in another.</p>

                     <p>But Herod was not onely displeased, but he did good things. Mark 6, 20.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Herod</hi> was indeed displeased with his sinnes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause<note place="margin">Mark 20, 6.</note> hee feared the punishment, and not because the lawe forbad it; for then hee would haue put away <hi>Herodias</hi> his brothers wife, &amp; haue repented of that main and grosse sin. Secondly, though he did good things, yet not throughly: for when the text sayeth, (hee did many things) it implyes that hee neglected other things which were as needfull to bee done as those which hee did: whereas the regenerate that consenteth to the law, doth hate, and repent of one sin as well as another, and allowe one duty as well another, though they perfectly neuer leaue any sinne nor doe any duty.</p>

                     <p>Yet it is reported of this Paul, that when hee was a Pharisy and vnregenerate, he was conuersant in all the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes of the law without rebuke?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>All this is true, and yet did not hee then consent to the lawe of God that it was good. First, because his conuersation was vnrebukeable outwardly &amp; before men alone, his lusts and inward motions being vicious and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full before God. Secondly, the feare of men or the feare of punishment from God, or both (and not the loue of the law) might and did moue him to be outwardly righteous. Lastly, hee was not stirred vp to the works which hee did by faith and charity, either towardes GOD or man. All things are quite contrary in the regenerate, who content to the law of God both outwardly and inwardly, and haue a pure heart cleansed by faith, the ground and foundation of all that good they do.</p>

                     <p>Yea, but euen regenerate men they do many euil things, quite contrary to the lawe, and doe leaue vndone sundry good things inioyned in the lawe, and in those thinges which they doe best, they come short to the perfection of the law: how doe they then consent to the law?</p>

                     <p>Yes, all this may be and stand very well together, if men consider his conclusion set downe in the next verse; which is, that <hi>Paul</hi> as he was renued, so farre his mind, his will, his affections, did all allow the whole law; and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils which he did, he was violently drawne vnto them by original sin, which still remained in him.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, wee haue from hence a notable difference betweene the godly and the vngodly, the sincere Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and the hypocrite: for the vngodly man and the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, when he doth any good or eschue any euill, it is not from the heart, because the law commaunds it; for he euer hath respect vnto gaine, or credit, or pleasure, or pain, and not to the will of God: but the godly though hee sin, yet from his heart he loues the law, hauing that in him which resisteth and hateth sin. Secondly, from hence we haue a special comfort vnto al such as consent to the law of God, whose inward man delighteth in it, and whose minde ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it: such surely are regenerate, though they haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fearefull imperfections and sinnes: yet if they in trueth allow the law, condemning those sinnes they doe, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing those things they doe not, because the law willeth them, (repe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ting from their harts so ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as they violate the law through weaknes) this is a certain mark of a new born child of God. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. It sheweth how fearful their case is which are ignorant of Gods law, either because they cannot, or
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:20835:233"/>
because they care not to know it. These do not consent to the Law which they do not know; and therefore are as yet in the estate of damnation. Therefore, it is a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing together with the preaching of the Gospel, to haue the Law soundly interpreted and applyed. For, as men cannot consent to the Gospell without the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospell, which is the power of God to write it in our heart; so we cannot so much as know the Law without the preaching of the Law. Finally, heere is a sure truth, that whosoeuer willeth not the euil which he doth, but disalloweth it, out of a reuerent loue vnto the Law, whereunto hee seeth the euill which he dooth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant, he certainly approoueth the Law to bee good, and a rule of rightnesse.</p>

                     <p>That euery regenerate man is diuided into two men, or into two parts, that is, himselfe and sin, the new man and the old, grace and corruption, flesh &amp; the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the law of the minde, and the lawe of the members. The reason heereof is, because in this life theit regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is vnperfect. Secondly, that a regenerate person takes his denomination from the better part, that is, from grace which raigneth in him, not from sinne which
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:20835:233"/>
doth but dwell in him. Thirdly, that part which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and renued in a man neuer sinneth, but it is that part which is corrupt and vnrenued that sinneth, &amp; doth euill. Fourthly, it affoords a plaine and euident marke to discerne a man that is regenerate, from him that is not regenerate.</p>

                     <p>There be seauen seuerall markes of the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Children of God, set downe in the latter part of this Chapter; that is, from the 14. verse to the end of it. The first is, to will that which is good, and to hate sinne, verse 15. The second, to consent to the law that it is good, and to delight in the sound knowledge and spirituall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thereof, verse 16, and 22. Thirdly, to haue an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, that is, such a man as is in secret and in the Spirite, verse 22. Fourthly, to feele a strife and fight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the law of the members, &amp; the law of the mind, verse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>. when the Spirite doth lust against the flesh, and the flesh against the Spirite. Fifthly, to account it our wretchednesse, to haue sinne still abiding and forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly working in vs, and in this respect to groane and to mourne in our soules, verse 24. Sixtly, to desire vnfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedly and constantly a perfect deliuerance from sin, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing thankes from the heart to God through Christ, for the grace of deliuerance already begun and wrought, verses 24, 25. Lastly to be led captiue vnto the Law of sinne, verse 23. which is all one with this named in our Text, to haue sinne not raigning but dwelling in them. For there is as great difference betweene sinne raigning and dwelling, as is betweene a king ruling a kingdome, and Subiects dwelling in a kingdome; or betweene a Maister in a family gouerning the house, and seruants in the house.</p>

                     <p>It is a Metaphor, or borrowed speech from the power and gouernment of house-holders, signifying the true and mighty presence of sinne, forcibly crossing and mightily striuing against the motions of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> in the heart of a regenerate man. This powerfull presence of sinne dwelling in vs, may be declared and set foorth by the comparison of seditious subiects, mutinous Citti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens and seruants, and of quarrelsome Inmates; who though they do but dwel in a kingdome, Citty or house, yet do prooue exceeding troublesome to their Princes, Gouernors, Owners, or Maisters: Likewise dwelling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinne doth mightily hinder good in Gods Children, and pull them to euill things.</p>

Thirdly, this reprooues such as knowing that there is such a cumbersome mate or guest as sinne dwelling in them, are yet secure: but much more it reproues such as are secure, and yet haue sinne raigning in them, as if it were nothing to bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled to such a Lord, as can pay no better wages but damnation in Hell.</p>

And there is very good reason for it, why this sentence cannot agree to such manner of men; namely, because they are not able in truth to say, that
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:20835:234"/>
they hate the euill which they doe, and that they would not doe it; because they sinne willingly, rushing into sin as a Horse into the battaile.

                     <p>First, that <hi>Paul</hi> did diuide himselfe into two parts; whereof the one is heere called the flesh, and the other the inward man, verse 22. Secondly, that a rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate party as he hath two parts, so he knowes them, &amp; can discerne them; as <hi>Paul</hi> heere complaines of his flesh; but afterwards giues thankes for his inner man. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, godly personnes are corrupted and depraued not in senses or sensuall parts and affection onely, but in their will and minde. Fourthly, if it bee thus with beleeuers, much more is it with them that beleeue not that there is no good in their flesh. Fiftly, they are deceyued, which thinke, that though men beleeue not, yet their minde remaines perfect in nature, able enough in all thinges to direct them to that which is right. Sixtly, they also are deceiued, which thinke, that before regeneration a man may do good workes, which may please God, &amp; to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of congruity. Lastly, they are deceiued, which say; that if men do what lyeth in them, then God will grant them his grace: for let men vnregenerate do what they can, yet they do naught but what is euill. For their flesh and corrupt nature, is the ground of all that they do, &amp; therefore they must needs sin. For the flesh is aduersaric to all good, and parent to beget all euill.</p>

                     <p>In that the Apostle would do that which was good, he had this of God, which prooues him a regenerate man: for when the Apostle sayeth, the deede and performance is from God as well as the will: he meaneth not that it is so alwayes, and in euery particular act of a renued man, but often times it is, and for the most part as it pleaseth God to giue assistance: therefore it is saide there, according to his good pleasure; now <hi>Paul</hi> for most part, could as well doe good as will good.</p>

                     <p>That it is not possible for any godly person what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, to doe any good so perfectly, as that there shoulde not be any sin in it: the reason is first, because the godly being not perfectly renued, therefore there must needs be some want and defect in the greatest good they doe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, because wicked desires be neuer absent from them
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:20835:237"/>
wholly, therefore good is neuer done perfectly by them: for as godly persons cannot perfectly doe euill, because they haue good desires in them, which resist sin and call the to the right way: so they cannot perfectly perfourme that which is good, because they want not euill desires, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and hinder them.</p>

Secondly, it reproues such as haue their minds lifted vp, when they haue done or spoke something well, whereas the imperfection of the deede ought to bee before them to abase them Thirdly, when Christians haue shewed their best care and endeuour to doe good things, they must not bee discouraged for such wants and faults which stick vnto their doings; but heartily repent, asking fogiuenesse of Christ, and striuing to do better. For as an earthlie father perceiuing in his childe a good will and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire to please him, taketh that hee doeth in good woorth though it be faultie: so will God spare his owne children,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:20835:237"/>
that doe good things willinglie though weakly, <hi>Mala.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>I will spare them as a man spareth his owne Sonne that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth him.</hi> Lastly, it reproueth such as thinke the keeping of the law to bee possible; whereas it is a transgression of the law, not onely to doe what wee should not, but to doe lesse then we should; a want of perfection breaks the law, no lesse then an euil done; from such defects none are free, no not <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That a regenerate man doth loue Gods morall Law, and take great delight in it. This delight doth not so much declare and shew it selfe in the pleasure which godly men take to know the thinges contained in the Law (for that is common with the wicked) but to do it, and conforme their hearts and manners agreeable vnto it; as he which seeth a curious artificiall picture, is so pleased with it, that he studieth how to expres it: so it fareth with Gods children.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>What reason haue Gods children to delight in the law, seeing it reueales sinne vnto them, accuseth them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes them?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, vnto the godly this is a great benefit which it brings that it doth discouer vnto them euils, that they may see them, repent of them, and forsake them, as well
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:20835:239"/>
as good, that they may practise it; and so driueth them neerer vnto Christ, that they may be saued by his grace.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>What other instruction may bee drawne from this Verse?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That seeing the children of God delight in the Law, they haue greater reason much more to be deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the word of the Gospell: because the doctrine of the Gospell healeth those diseases which the Lawe sheweth forth; and effectually comforteth, whome the Law hath terrified; being both seede of their new birth, and food to nourish them after they are borne againe.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Is this a proper marke of regenerate men to delight in Gods word?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Yea, it is so: forasmuch as none can delight in such wise, but those that haue the Spirit of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> to engender in them a loue of God, and of his word, and that Doctrine which is taught therein.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>But seeing it is written of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that they doe heare the Gospell with ioy, what difference shall we put between the godly and vngodly in their delight?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>The difference is both in the matter, manner, and end of their delight and ioy. First, as for the matter &amp; ground of delight vnto the godly, it is the obedience yeelded to the Law, and Christ receiued by the Gospel; whereas bare knowledge of the Law and Gospell, is the ground of an Hypocrites delight. Secondly, they differ also in the manner of their delight; for the delight of a godly man is sincere and constant, as proceeding from the speciall grace of the Spirit; the delight of a Wicked man is vnsound and vnconstant, proceeding either from nature, or from a general grace of the Spirit: therefore, as it looketh not to God, so it lasteth not. Thirdly, they differ in the effect and end of it: for the delight of the godly leads them to an vniuersall practise of the Law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and outward: so doth not the delight of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, which content themselues with an outwarde refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of life at the vtmost. This may be set foorth by
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:20835:239"/>
the comparison of two skilfull Painters, who both togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther behold one and the same portraiture or picture ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry artificially drawne; whereof the one contents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to behold it and commend it, but endeauours not himselfe to make the like: the other so praiseth it, that he setteth his skill a-worke to make such an one. So it fareth betweene a man regenerate, and a man vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; the former so liketh and delighteth in the word, as he studieth to be a doer of it; the latter, resteth in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the word, neglecting action, and hating to be reformed. And lastly, their delight doth differ in the measure of their ioy; for euill men delight in riches and pleasures more then in the word, but godly persons haue more delight in the word, then in all manner of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. <hi>O Lord how do I loue thy Law? I more ioy in it then in</hi>

                     <p>First, that all the motions of a renewed minde agreeable vnto Gods wil, must bee obeyed and submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto, as men obey the iust Lawes of their Prince. For they haue such force to binde Christians to obedience, as the Princes Law hath to binde the subiect. Secondly, that a renued minde and sinfull lust, bee most repugnant the one to the other. And therefore it is, that a Christian hath a continual and greeuous combat and war with sin. For no sooner can his minde guided by the Spirit, frame it selfe to that which Gods law commands, but present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he finds a most dangerous and strong conflict and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance made by sinne against him. Such as feele it, doe marke it, and mourne for it, and bemone themselues to God their defence.</p>

In like manner, sinfull lustes sometimes so farre preuailed in the Apostle, as to leade him prisoner, bound hand and foote, (as it were) and to make him a Bondslaue to his sinne: as hee saide afore; <hi>I am solde vnder sinne.</hi> And againe, <hi>I doe the thing which I hate, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>That the end and issue of the strife which the godly haue with sinne, is sometime very heauy &amp; gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, whilst they are brought vnder the power of sinfull lusts for a time, as slaues and vassals which are subiect to a Tyrant.</p>

                     <p>The Apostle sayd in the sixt Chapter, that sin should not haue dominion ouer the godly: howe commeth it then to passe, that sinne doth so ouercome the godly, that it taketh them prisoners and captiues?</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>The Apostle meant in the sixt Chapter, that sinne should not haue lawfull dominion ouer them, such as a King hath ouer his subiectes, whom hee ruleth without controulment. Howbeit sinne (as a Tyrant and Vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per) may subdue and ouercome the godly, keeping them as prisoners against their will; as many valiant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons vnable to resist, are led captiue by the enemy. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the Apostle in the sixt Chapter, meant of full do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and for euer; whereas the godly are captiues to sinne in part onely, and for a time: for they wrestle out and ouercome at length by their faith in Christ.</p>

                     <p>Seeing both the godly and the wicked are captines to sinne, declare vnto vs more plainly, what difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Captiuity?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>The maine difference is this; that whereas the wicked freely and with their whole will put themselues vnder the bondage of their wicked lusts, godly men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come captiues against their will, with an earnest desire &amp; longing to be freed from their captiuity &amp; bondage, which may bee thus further explaned. The godly are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome with sinfull lusts, not because they are willing, but because they are weak to resist, and being ouercom, they are neuer quiet till they haue shaken off the power of their lustes, that they may returne vnto their former chearefull seruice and obedience of God: but the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked being tempted with their lusts &amp; euil motions, they yeeld vnto them without resistance. This may be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:20835:242"/>
the better set foorth vnto vs, by the comparison of two Soldiours in a warlike fight, being of two Nations, whereof the one bearing a false heart vnto his King and Country, doth of set purpose and willingly yeelde him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be taken prisoner, and with purpose to practise treachery against his lawfull King. The other is carried away prisoner, because he was vnable to with-stand the force of his aduersary, yet keepeth still a good heart to his king, vsing all good endeuours to recouer his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Euen so it is heere in this case, the godly come under the power of sinne, surprised by deceitfullness of sinne, and by the sleights of Sathan, beeing vnable to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide their encounters, carring still an vpright heart vnto God and to his seruice. Whereas the vngodly make themselues voluntary slaues to Sathan and sin, very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly fighting vnder their banners, against God and his word. This whole matter will yet be made more cleare by some few instances and examples out of Scripture, as first of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who was ouercome by his incontinency, being violently led captiue of it, his hart striuing against it, though with great weakenesse; who beeing in the bonds of sinne, did much desire and seeke after the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of grace, as Psal. 51, throughout.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, of <hi>Peter</hi> who was led away captiue of carnal presumption and security, howbeit not of set purpose before, nor without reluctation in the instant of yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and repentance or rising againe afterwards. Lastly, by the example of this our Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> who confesseth that sinne led him captiue, and in this captiuity by sinne he mourned for his thraldome, counting it a misery, and suing for deliuerance. But it is quite contray in the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, as appeareth by the example of <hi>Caine, Esau, Ahab, Iudas and others,</hi> who did lye still vnder their captiuity, not seeing any freedome, or nor mistrusting or misliking their sluery.</p>

the force of their enemies, and their owne weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and the hurt that sinne hath done to mighty strong men, to put on the whole armour of God, being excce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding watchfull and giuen to prayer. Secondly, heere is an admonition for weake Christians to be meruailous heedfull vnto themselues, with great mistrust of their owne infirmities, when as such an one as <hi>Paul</hi> could not alwayes stand against the power of sinne. Thirdly, heere is consolation for such as at any time shall faint &amp; yeeld in the fight against sinne, that they be not too much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged therein, forasmuch as such a Champion as this blessed seruant of Christ, hath beene danted and quailed by sin and Satan. Lastly, heere is a marke whereby wee may iudge of a regenerate person, namely this; that hee is drawne captiue to the law of sin, and is carried away by the lust of sin, yet not without contradiction: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the wicked which are voide of grace, of their owne accord do run on to euils, as a horse vnto the battaile, as Rom. 3, 15. <hi>Their feete are swift to shedbloud.</hi> And againe, <hi>They drinke iniquity like Water, and draw sinne with Cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropes, Esay</hi> 5, 18.</p>

                     <p>First, that it is a wretched thing, to carry about one but the remainder of sinne, and to be troubled with the continuall assaults and force of it. The reasons here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be: First, because sinne euen in the godly doth defile their conscience within, and their actions without, Mat. 15, 18. Iames 1. 21. Secondly, it offends their most good and louing Father, being contrary to his Law, Ro. 7, 7. Thirdly, it doth grieue and make sad the holy Spirite of God, Ephes. 4, 30. Lastly, it procures many temporall chastisements, and deserues eternall punishment. See <hi>Dauids</hi> example, 2 Sam. 12, 10. Rom. 6, 23.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, it reproues them that make slight &amp; slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reckoning of their sinnes. Secondly, it admonisheth the godly to be humbled, because howsoeuer they bee blessed with forgiuenesse of sinne: yet their blessednesse is not perfect, but mixt with some misery.</p>

                     <p>It is the marke and token of a regenerate man, to feele the misery he is cast into by the force of sinne, to mourne for it, and complaine of it. The reason hereof is, because none but such as haue the Spirit of Christ, can thinke themselues miserable in this behalfe, that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough sin they are drawne from the obedience of Gods Law: for they that be vnre generate, thinke themselues
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:20835:243"/>
wretched for bodily euils, as if they bee blinde, or dease, or maymed, or imprisoned, or extreame poore; they neuer take themselues wretched in that they are full of spirituall euils, and thereby hindred in the seruice of God.</p>

                     <p>First, it affoords a great comfort vnto such as can vnsaignedly sigh because of their sinnes, which still sticke in their nature and striue against grace. Secondly, here is a testimony against such as beare their sins without griefe, that they are not Gods children. If there be a strugling in the wombe, <hi>Rebecka</hi> feeleth it; but the barren which bring not forth, feele no such wrestling.</p>

                     <p>Some expound it thus; for a mortall body sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to death, and then the meaning is, that <hi>Paul</hi> doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to be freed from this conflict with sin by his corporall death.</p>

                     <p>That the battell of sinne will not be at an end, while the godly liue in this worlde: in which regards, the sighes and repentance, the exercise and striuings of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man, are continuall and haue no other tearme but death. And thus God will haue it bee for many good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses: to exercise patience, stirre vp prayer, watchfulnesse, to humble vs by sight of our weaknesse, and comfort vs by experience of his power.</p>

                     <p>Some by body doe vnderstand our corrupt and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane nature, euen the whole masse of sinne as it is yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortified; which is called a bodie of death, to signifie that
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:20835:244"/>
it is a deadly thing deseruing both temporall and cternall death, this is the best interpretation.</p>

                     <p>In that sinne is likened to a body, it teacheth that it is no idle &amp; weake thing, but as it were a thing subsisting full of force and power, and therefore not to be neglected. Secondly, as a body hath many members, so sin hath innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable lusts. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 29. 30. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5, 19, 20.</p>

                     <p>That the bondage of sinne, euen such as it is to the godly, is a verie grieuous and heauie thing, often thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting them into the iawes, and wrapping them in the bondes of death both worldly and euerlasting; which makes them cry out, wretched man, and blessed are they which for this can cry thus.</p>

                     <p>That as <hi>Paul</hi> faints not in the combate, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts himselfe with a certaine hope of victory: in like manner all the godly must fight against sinne, with assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of hope to ouercome in the end, so they striue law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. 2. The godly must bee so sure to ouercome, as
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:20835:244"/>
that they doe reioyce and triumph as if they had already ouercome. Thirdly, their trust to ouercome, relieth not so much vpon their owne vertues, workes, and merites, as vpon the mercies of God the Father, by whose aide &amp; grace they looke certainly to preuaile. Lastly, their hope of helpe and aid from the mercies of God, is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the merites and grace of our Lord Iesus Christ, and not vpon the law, or good works or good conscience: not these things, but Christ hath appeased Gods wrath, reconciled, and continually pacifieth him.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>First, that <hi>Paul</hi> deuides himselfe into two parts, mind and flesh; not wholly flesh nor wholly the mind, but part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the one, partly the other. Secondly, that according to these two beginnings or grounds, his purposes and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors were diuers: for in his mind he serued the law of God, to know and to do it; and in his flesh he serued the law of sin, that his corruption which still stuck in him, did solicite him to euill, and sometimes ouercame him.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>Snfull infirmity must keepe the Saintes from pride, and their grace must stay them from despaire: they cannot nor ought to be proud which carry sinne in their heart as a law, neither neede they faint which haue grace for a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour in their mind.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>First, that he speaks of no other then himselfe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that he speakes not in time past but present; which serues to consute the <hi>Palagians</hi> and <hi>Libertines;</hi> who take it so as if <hi>Paul</hi> spake all this from the 14. verse forward, in the name and person of a meere natural man, and had set forth no other fight but, that which is between reason directing to things right and honest; and affection or will drawing vnto thinges crooked and vnhonest: as if <hi>Paul</hi> had in all this, shewed himselfe an Arestotelian, and not an Apostle, extolling the power of nature, and not the force of grace;
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:20835:245"/>
debasing and disgracing sensuality, and not sin and birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption, which both in reason and will euen after rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, vttereth force and great power, like a mighty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, striuing and fighting euen against the good worke of the Spirit, in regenerate ones.</p>

                     <p>Two: The first a doctrinall or exhortatory comfort against the secret corruption of nature, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the remainder of sinne and corruption, still stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dwelling in the godly: for though sin remaines, yet it is not damnable to the godly. This part continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vnto the middle of verse 17. The second part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines a comfortable exhortation, patiently to suffer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions for the name of Christ, because their afflictions haue most equal and wholesome causes, and most health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effects. This part continueth to the end of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                     <p>It doth propound and set downe the comfort against dwelling-sinne, that albcit sinne doth abide in the godly, yet condemnation doth not abide, but is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away.

                     <p>Two wayes: First, by the circumstance of time, and secondly, of the persons. It is declared by the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance of time thus: Now that wee are iustified by faith, and sanctified by the Spirite, there is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to vs. Secondly, the persons to whom this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort doth belong, are described by two conditions. First, that they are in Christ, and secondly, that they walke not after the flesh, but after the Spirite.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>But how doth this generall comfort belonging vnto all the godly, depend vpon the former Chapter, where Pauls par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular conflict with sinne, and his complaint against it, was set out vnto vs, together with his thanksgiuing for his deliuerance from it by Christ?</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Indeed one would thinke that vpon these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises he should haue inferred, there is no condemnation to me, but measuring all the godly by his owne sence &amp; feeling, he doth enlarge the comfort, propounding it more generally thus; Now then there is no condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to such that are as I am.

                     <p>A damnatory sentence of the law, to wit; that euery one is accursed that transgresseth it. Or thus more plainely, The sentence of God, the Iudge of the world, pronouncing guily, and adiudging to eternall death such as transgresse the law.</p>

                     <p>Full and perfect freedome from this damnatorie sentence and punishment of death; also that the godly that are thus freed from diuine condemnation and most dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full destruction, are also accepted for righteous, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of eternall saluation through Iesus Christ: nay there is not onely no condemnation, but certaine saluation vnto such. This may be collected to be the sence of these words, thus: Where there is no condemnation, there is no wrath; where there is no wrath, there is grace; where there grace, there is neither sin nor death; and where death is chased away, there must needs be life and saluation.</p>

                     <p>First, we learne here a difference betweene the doctrine of the law and the Gospell, and al other doctrines whatsoeuer; which appeares herein, that this doctrine of comfort can bee fetched and drawne from none other but from the doctrine of the Gospell. Secondly, it is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that exceeds all other comforts, to be exempted from condemnation and the wrath of God, without the which men were in farre worser case then the bruite beastes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they liue securely without feare: wheras men if they be without this comfort, that they shall not bee condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, cannot but all their life long, liue in a continuall feare of condemnation, which must needs disquiet their hearts, and rob them of al true contentment, &amp; rest in their soules. This comfort may be set forth by the comparison of a fellon or traitor, which haue great comfort and quietnesse of mind, being by the kings gracious pardon freed from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued and sentenced death; and of other malefactours li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in dayly expectation of death, to which they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged without hope of pardon.</p>

                     <p>Though it be very ioyfull newes to all beleeuers, that they shall not be condemned, yet this comfort should be most effectuall to the godly poore; because amidst ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worldly wants and miseries which trouble them, it may

and should excedingly ioy their heartes to thinke vppon, what great good thinges they haue by Christ, as forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of all sinnes, freedome from all punishment of sinne, from Gods anger and hell fire; yea and more then this, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen perfect righteousnes and eternall life: of which things the least is more worth then a whole world; and therefore whosoeuer cannot reioyce in these thinges (whatsoeuer their worldly crosses be) it argueth deepe vnthanksulnesse, and is a signe of vnbeleefe. Finally, touching the godly rich, they are to be admonished here, that they are more to cheere themselues with the comfort of this freedome, then with all their wealth and worship.</p>

                     <p>First, that none saue the faithfull are capable of the former comfort, because onely they are in Christ; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore howsoeuer hypocrites and other wicked men, yea &amp; prophane men and Atheists, do lay claime to this comfort, yet it doeth not at all belong vnto them, because they are out of Christ. Secondly, wee cannot be partakers of any benefit by Christ, except first we be in Christ, as the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers must be one with the head, and the branches with the vine, ere they can draw any life from them. Thirdly, such as beleeue in Christ and abide in this faith, may be sure and certaine to be saued: the reasons hereof bee, first because euery beleeuer is iustified and is freed from the guiltinesse of his sinnes, and therefore must needs be saued. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, hee is one with Christ, in whome there is nothing but righteousnesse and life, therefore he is free from sinne and damnation.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Yea but though hee is freed from sinnes past and the punishment of them, yet euery beleeuer by his dayly sins, makes himselfe worthy and guilty of death?</p>

                     <p>True beleeuers neede not feare, neither sins past, present, nor to come; for this vniuersall negatiue particle (No) excludes all sinnes, the beleeuer being iustified from sins past, sinnes present are pardoned, and sinnes to come shall not be imputed; therefore he needs feare no destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     <p>This doctrine shakes out of mens heartes the feare of condemnation, and therefore in that behalfe they may bee spiritually secure: but it nourisheth the feare of God, beeing an enemy to carnail security, <hi>Psalme</hi> 130, 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12, 1, 2.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Yea but we cannot be so certaine of our saluation as S. Paul, who had his certainty by speciall reuelation.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>This is not so; for first <hi>Paul</hi> speakes not here of his owne particular assurance, but giues a generall comfort common to all the faithfull; therefore he writeth not, there is no condemnation to mee, but, to them. Secondly, the signes and tokens of this comfort, to wit, to bee in Christ, and to walke after the Spirit, are common with <hi>Paul</hi> to all other true Christians, verse 1. Therefore the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of saluation, and the comfort from thence must needes be common.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Yea but it is no where written that thou art in Christ, and that thou shalt not be condemned, and it is the doctrine of Protestants to beleeue no more then is written, and therefore no man can be assured to be saued.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>When wee teach that no more is to be beleeued then is written, it is to be vnderstood of vniuersall doctrin and generall points of sauing trueth, to which wee are not bound to giue credit, nor can we firmly assent vnto them, vnlesse wee finde them in the written word, which is the onely sufficient perfect rule of faith and manners, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. 29. and 21, 24. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3, 16. Secondly, wee affirme and hold, that the certainty of euery mans owne saluation is written in the fleshy tables of his heart, by the finger of the Holy Ghost: for as this vniuersal trieth, that there is no
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:20835:247"/>
condemnation to such as are in Christ, is written in the word; so this particular assumption of the faithfull: but I beleeue and am in Iesus Christ, is written in his owne heart by the Spirit, which alwayes togither with Faith, workes and engenders a feeling and testimonie of his owne Faith, whereby he knowes he is a beleeuing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. 2 Cor. 13, 5. 2 Timoth, 1, 12. Marke 9, 24. all which places shew, that a man hath in himselfe a witnesse of his owne Faith.</p>
                     <p>Now wee are bound no lesse certainely to beleeue the inward particular witnesse, written by the Spirite, in the hearts and consciences of ieuery faithfull person, then that outwarde vniuersall testimony which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the word: for both these testimonies come from one Spirit, and the sence of faith, is as firme as an article of faith.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Yea, but this singular Faith, what is it else but a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular presumption? For how common is it for euery euill liuer to say, I trust to be saued?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It is verie true, that such as haue no faith and so be not in Christ, if they say they trust to bee saued, it is presumption: but for a truely faithfull man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, and to say it, is no presumption but dutie, and godly submission to him that commands to beleeue in his Sonne.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>

                     <p>By this marke, which the Apostle himselfe giues vs, that such as haue Faith and be in Christ, walke after the Spirit, that is, by the Spirit they do mortifie the flesh, and the workes thereof.</p>

                     <p>It teacheth vs the exceeding priuiledge of a true Christian beleeuer, in that he is freed from all feare of condemnation, and eternall punnishment in Hell fire.</p>

                     <p>But tell vs whether it may be knowne who they are that are knit to Christ by faith?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, it may surely be knowne though not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet to themselues, for otherwise this freedome &amp; priuiledge from condemnation, could bee no ground or matter at all of any comfort. Secondly, the taking of an elect soule out of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the corruption of nature, to graft it into Christ, is not such a sleight worke, but that it may be knowne and percciued of him in whom it is wrought, being a person come to yeares and discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For it is the opening the eyes of the blinde, the quickening of the dead, the translating from darkenesse to light, the healing of the withcrcd hand, the making of the lame to walke, the setting at liberty, him that was in prison. All which, shewes this work to be both migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and manifcst.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Seeing you say that he that is in Christ by faith may know that hee is so, declare vnto vs by what meanes hee may know it?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>By two meanes: First, euery true beleeuer hath with his faith a gift and power from Gods Spirite, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he vnderstandeth and seeth his owne faith, as one that sees, or feeles, or walkes, knowes infallibly that he doth these things. Besides it is written, that by the Spirit we know the things that are giuen vs of God, 1. Cor. 2, 12. Where-vnto adde the example of the man, Marke, 9, 24. and of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. Tim. 1, 12. excepting the time of some great fals, or strong temptations, or the instant of a mans new birth, when this knowledge of a mans owne faith is not so cleare. Secondly, euery true beleeuer may know it by the proper and peculiar fruite of a true faith; to wit, by an holy and vpright conuersation, which is called heere the not walking after the flesh, but after the Spirite. For as the Sunne is perceiued by his heate and light, and the goodnes of a tree is knowne by the fruite, and a liuing man by his motion, speech, and actions; so a beleeuing Christian is discerned to be such a one, by his
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:20835:248"/>
godly and religious life. Therefore are we exhorted by <hi>Peter</hi> to make our calling &amp; electio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sure by good works, 2. Pet. 1. 10. For howsoeuer faith go alone in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending Christ, and in the matter of our saluation by him, yet in our conuersation it is not alone, but accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with good workes, as tokens and signes to make it knowne. Therefore seeing a faithfull person cannot bee condemned and perish, and euery such an one hath good meanes whereby to know his owne faith. Heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it followes necessarily, that euery faithfull person may assuredly know he shall be saued.</p>

                     <p>The ouerthrow of all Christianity and Religion. For except we be sure of grace &amp; free loue to vs in Christ for our saluation, we cannot loue him, nor hope in him, nor pray to him, nor obey him, nor be thankfull to him, nor do any other good worke but in hyprocrisie, 1. Iohn. 4, 19. Rom. 5, 2, 3, 10. Secondly, this doctrine of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty and doubting of saluation, shakes the suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and persection of Christs merites, destroyes the truth and constancy of Gods promise, &amp; weakeneth the testimony of the holy Spirite witnessing to the faithfull that they are Gods Children.

                     <p>Yea, but they which are now in Christ and doe beleeue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are not sure to perseuere to the end?</p>

                     <p>Yes, he that is once in Christ, shall euer bee in him. A member of Sathan, may become a member of Christ; but a member of Christ can neuer bee the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Sahtan: for none can plucke them from Christ, Iohn 10, 28. Who also prayeth for our perseuerance, Ioh. 17, 11.</p>

Lastly, heere are all men admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed howe to iudge and discerne of their owne faith, whether they bee true beleeuers, and such personnes as shall not bee condemned; which may bee done by the second condition heereunto added and annexed, to wit; if hee walke not after the Flesh, but after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>First, that they vse not to take counsell of Gods word, to make it their rule of euery particular action of their life, Psal. 119, 9. Secondly, they neuer looke vpon their patterne and example Christ Iesus, how he spake &amp; did, that they may do the like, 1 Iohn 2, 5. Iohn 10, 27.
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:20835:250"/>

                     <p>It is right so, because a spirituall or godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, must not be iudged of by one or a few actions; but by the tenour of it, and as it holds, and is for the most and greatest part: otherwise none should be said, to walke after the Spirite, because there is none that liues and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not.</p>

the flesh. Secondly, it assureth them that walke after the Spirite, that they are the very members of Christ. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it teacheth all men, that sanctification of the spirite, is an vnseparable companion, and fruite of our iustification by faith: moisture and water, heate and fire, light and Sun, are not more firmely vnited then faith and holinesse.</p>

                     <p>It is a proofe and confirmation of the former verse, and of the latter part of it, (as some thinke) by a reason taken from the efficient and begetting cause of holy conuersation, to wit; the Spirite of Christ <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Some by the Spirit, do vnderstand properly the holy Spirit, the third person in the Trinitie, which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernes and rules our minds by his inward motions, as by a Law. Others, by it vnderstand the doctrine of faith, or of the Gospell, which is a Doctrine of the spirit and life, Psal. 19, 7. 2 Cor. 2. If we follow this exposition, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning will be thus much; that the Gospell or doctrine of faith doth free, that is, absolue and pronounce mee free from the Law of sinne and death, that is, from the guilt and condemnation that the Law of <hi>Moyses</hi> threatneth vnto sinners. This then is a very godly exposition, but not fit to this text, that doth not at al speak of the law of <hi>Moyses,</hi> which is no where in Scripture called the Law of sinne; but forbiddeth it and commandeth wholsome and profitable things: neyther doth he entreat heere of the efficacy and power of the Gospell, and the doctrine of Faith, which is neuer called the Law of the Spirit. But I iudge Spirit to be put heere for the worke and efficacy of the Spirit (to wit) for the grace of Sanctification &amp; holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which is called a Law, because it is like to a Lawe, hauing power to gouerne and moderate. And the word Life, is added, to shewe that the Spirit which worketh this, is no idle and dead thing, but a liuely viuifying &amp; quickning Spirit, being the author both of an holy life, and eternall life, and that first in Christ the head; &amp; for his sake and merit, in the faithful his members. That this is heere meant, may appeare by the opposing and setting it against the law of sinne. Vnder which must needes be comprehended corruption of nature, being contrarie to holinesse.</p>

                     <p>I graunt then, that by the spirit of life is meant the holinesse and purity of mans Nature, as a worke of that quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning spirit which ruleth by a Law: but whether take you it of
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:20835:251"/>
holinesse inherent and wrought in our own Nature being rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, or in Christ his humane nature, as in the proper subiect?</p>

                     <p>I do take this latter to bee true, that it is taken of the Sanctification of Christ his nature. My reasons be, first, because it is written, not in vs, but in Christ (the law of the spirit of life which is in Christ.) Secondly, because Christ his Sanctification meriteth deliuerance from sin, not our sanctification, which is but a token and testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our purchased deliuerance. Thirdly, by the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Christes sanctification, this comfort (that wee shall not be condemned) is confirmed vnto vs. Lastly, if we interpret it of our begun inherent Sanctification, we shall further the rotten opinion of the Papists, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iustification by inherent grace.

teach all men to make application of this comfort vnto themselues, saying and beleeuing, Christ freed me, there is no condemnation to me: for this is the power of true faith, to appropriate generall promises; contrary to the Papists, who will haue faith to be nothing else, but a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall assent to the Scriptures, without particular affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the promise of Christ.</p>

                     <p>Because the guilt of our sinnefull nature is as a bond to make vs bound vnto eternall death. Secondly, because in such as are not regenerate, it doth exercise a mortiferous tyrannical power and gouernment.</p>

                     <p>It affoords vs an instruction, a comfort, reproose, and confutation. The instruction is, that not onely Christ his obedience in his life, and the sufferings in his death, but the sanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his humane nature is ours, and is as verily belonging to the faithfull, as if they had bin borne without sinne. Secondly, the comfort is that such as are in Christ may in all their temptations in life and death, comfort themselues with this assurance, that the sinnes neither of their actions, nor of their nature, shall euer be imputed to them. Though they may often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times feele their wicked and rebellious nature, stirre and resist Gods law, yet such as doe resist the motions of sin, yeelding themselues obediently to the motions of the Spirite, are secured and made certaine that their remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning sinne shall neuer condemne them; because Christ hath freed and deliuered them from it perfectly, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:20835:252"/>
them his owne sanctification to bee theirs. It is a maruailous comfort to them that haue neede of it, and can apprehend it. Thirdly, this doth reprooue the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant dissolute Christian, who neuer thinkes what an euil his corrupt nature is, nor is euer troubled with those euill motions and desires that suddenly spring from it: full little doe they consider that the Sonne of God must descend from Heauen, and humble himselfe to become a man, that hee might free vs from the impurity of our humane nature. And lastly, it doth consute our blinde erring Papists, of whom the very wisest of them neuer came so farre as to know that naturall concupiscence is a sinne in the regenerate, and stands in neede of a Sauiour.</p>

                     <p>It renders a reason to prooue, that the most perfect holinesse of Christs hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature (called in the former verse, the Spirit of life) being imputed vnto beleeuers, doth free them from sin and death, that is, from the remainder of sinne sticking still in their nature, and the punishment of eternall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction due to it. This reason is taken from the end of Gods purpose in sending his Sonne to take mans nature into the fellowship of his person; for he was sent to take flesh vpon him, to helpe and succour the infirmity of our flesh. Or more plainely thus, Christ was sent of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to take the nature of man in the wombe of a virgin, free from sinne, by the worke of the Holy-Ghost, to this end, that he might restore our nature vnto such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of righteousnesse, as the exactnesse of Gods law doth require. For though the lawe did teach a perfect righteousnesse both of nature and actions, yet it is very vnable to bring vs there-vnto, because wee doe lacke
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:20835:253"/>
strength and power to performe and keepe it both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after our regeneration. From whence doth fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that seeing by the strength of the Law wee cannot attaine perfect righteousnesse and saluation with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from sinne and death, because of the infirmitie of our flesh; therefore it was of necessitie, that Christ shold take our Nature full of holinesse, to do that for vs which the Law could not do, that is, to destroy sin and death, and to make them (which by Faith lay holde on him) so absolutely righteous as the Law requires. For thus the case standeth, that not onely our thoughts, wordes, and workes should be free from sinne, and wholly vpright, but also, that our nature, euen the verie faculties of our reason and will, should be in all things conformable to Gods will reuealed in his Law, as <hi>Adam</hi> was in his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and according to that which is written, <hi>Loue God with all thine heart, &amp;c.</hi> Now, because none, no not the godliest, do euer get this perfection while they are here, (their nature still remaining corrupt in part, and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling against God, Rom. 7, 22.) therefore all must needes haue perished, except our nature had bin fully sanctified in the man Christ, who is freely allowed to the faithfull, to free them from condenmation.</p>

                     <p>What Law is meant heere, and what is it that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do?</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>By Law is heere meant, not the Ceremoniall, but the Moral Law, which is impossible to iustifie a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, or to bestow perfect righteousnes vpon him, as appeareth by the beginning of the next verse.</p>

                     <p>Yet it was said in the seauenth Chapter, that the law

was ordained vnto life?</p>

                     <p>The Apostle sheweth there, what it is able to doe in his owne nature; and heere, what it is not able to doe to vs that are sinners. For the Law (by Gods ordinance) could iustifie vs, and bring vs to life eternall.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>But how is it that the Law cannot iustifie and make vs righteous seeing it doth teach a perfect righteousnesse?</p>

                     <p>It is true indeede, that the Lawe instructeth vs fully, both what is to be done, and what is to be auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; but there are 3. other things required to the iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of vs, which it is impossible for the Law to do for vs. As first, to offer vs forgiuenesse of those thinges wee do against the Law, which accuseth, but absolueth not. Secondly, to worke faith in vs, to lay hold vppon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse being offred, which the law cannot engender. Thirdly, to put strength and power into vs, that we may be able to keepe all the commandements of the Law, to the end of our life. All which things are impossible to the Law, because it only instructeth what to do; but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistreth no strength to do, that it bids. It promiseth life to the doers, &amp; threatneth death to the transgressors, but offreth no power to sinners, much lesse giues faith to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it; for this is the office of the Gospell, 2 Cor. 3, 9, 7, 8. The cause why these things are impossible to the Lawe, is because it is weake, that is, vneffectual and feeble for these purposes; which commeth not from the Law, but from our flesh and corrupt nature.</p>

                     <p>That naughtinesse and sinfull corruption, that through <hi>Adams</hi> fall passed thorough all mankinde, and doth remaine still euen in men regenerate, but it is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected and reformed in part in them, and that daily til it be abolished.</p>

                     <p>What is the effect and fruite of this remaining cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and sinne?</p>

<pb n="502" facs="tcp:20835:254"/>
keepe the Law. As first, because through force of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining corruption, they do diuers things contrarie to the Lawe. Secondly, they leaue vndone manie good things commanded by the Law. Thirdly, in the good things which they do, there is much imperfection and vncleannesse, therefore it is impossible to bee kept of the most righteous that is. In our creation it was possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and in state of glorification shall bee, but in estate of our vnperfect Sanctification, it cannot be.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Is it not a wrong to God to say, that he hath giuen vs a Law impossible to be kept?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>No, none at all: First, because in our Creation, we receiued strength to keepe it, which we lost through our owne default. Shall a Landlord be blamed, because the Tenant is vnable to pay his rent? Secondly, because in the estate of glorification, wee shall haue power to keep it perfect, for then our knowledge and loue of God and our neighbour shall be perfect. Thirdly, because in the estate of regeneration, the godly may be saide af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a sort, and in some sence perfectly to keep it. For the regenerating Spirit hath begunne in them obedience to the Law, giuing them strength to desire and endeauour it. Also their wants and failinges in their obedience are pardoned, and he is saide to haue no sinne, when that is not imputed which is done. And lastly, the perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of Christ, is allowed vnto the faithfull. <hi>Omnia mandata Dei (inquit August.) fact a deputa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tur, quando quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid non sit, ignoscitur.</hi>

                     <p>The wicked which are strangers from Christ, are absolutely vnable to do any part of it, but breake it thoroughout, Rom. 5, 8. Secondly, the regenerate and godly, they are not able by grace inherent in their own persons perfectly to do it, but faile in many things, and sundry wayes, 1 Iohn 1, 7, 8. Iames 3, 2.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Declare vnto vs the profit that we are to make of this Doctrine, touching the impossibility of keeping the Law, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing iustified by it.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>First, it conuinceth and confuteth both the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi> and the Papist: the one, because they teach, that men by the strength of nature are able to keep the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements: the other, that by strength of grace, the godly are not only able to keep the Law, but to do more then the Law requireth. Secondly, it serues to humble vs much, that we cannot keepe the Law, and that tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough our sinfull weaknesse: also to stirre vs vppe vnto Prayer for grace to yeelde better obedience vnto it, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that strength from God which wee haue not in our selues, to be able in some measure to yeelde obedience to the Law. Thirdly, it instructeth all the faithfull, to know, that iustification before God, is not to be had by good workes, because they are imperfect, not answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the rigour of the Law, and are all stayned by the corruption of the flesh mingled with them. Fourthly, this doth teach vs, that seeing we cannot haue iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Law; therefore all men must bee content to deny themselues, and go out of themselues, and seeke perfect righteousnesse in another, to wit, euen from the Sonne of God sent into the world, that he may be made man for vs; and the end of the Law, for righteousnesse to all which beleeue.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>What are we to learne from these words, that GOD sent his owne Sonne?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>These three seuerall Lessons. First, the distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the persons in the Trinity; for if the Sonne be sent from the Father, of necessity he is a person distinct from the Father; which confuteth <hi>Sabelius,</hi> who held a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction not of persons, but of names. Secondly, that Christ is the sonne of God otherwise then we are, euen his own sonne, that is, consubstantiall and coequall with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, contrary to the <hi>Arrians,</hi> who denied the eternall Godhead of the Sonne, whome they make an inferiour second created God, that is, indeede not a God at all. Thirdly, hence we learne, that when the high and soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne cause of our saluation is sought for, wee may not
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:20835:255"/>
stay in Christ himselfe, but arise vp vnto the goodnesse of God the Father, sending his Son: which confuteth such as will haue foreseene faith and workes to be the mouing cause of appointing vs vnto saluation; when as Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe is not the impulsiue moouing cause of appoynting vs vnto saluation, but Gods owne loue moued him to giue and send Christ vnto vs, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 16.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It doth admonish all the faithfull, that since God freely out of his loue sent his Son for them; therefore it is their duty to send their harts vnto him, wholly to bee his, as men send mutually gifts one to another. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>What is meant here by the similitude of sinfull flesh?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>The meaning is, that Christ being sent of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, became a very man, hauing the true nature of a man, being like to all other men except sin: also by flesh is here meant, humane nature consisting of body and soule, being considered without corruption of sin.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Tim</speaker>
                     <p>Why doth he say, in the similitude of flesh?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>To teach vs that Christes manhoode not onely seemed and appeared, but indeed was such, as is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and nature of euery other man. Secondly, to shewe vs, that howsoeuer a naturall eye could see nothing but the forme of a man, yet that he had another, euen a diuine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not to be perceiued but by the eye of faith,</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Why is sin added here and put to flesh?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>First, because humane nature as we beare it, is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with sin: but Christ tooke it pure without sin. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, our nature as Christ tooke it, though it were free from the contagion of sin, yet it was not free from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and fruites of sin; for he was subiect to hunger, thirst, cold, nakednesse, wearinesse, and death it selfe: which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are the necessarie consequents of sin, therefore are they here called by the name of sin.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>What is the instruction that ariseth from these words being thus opened?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That Christ was truely incarnate and made man
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:20835:255"/>
for our sakes: as God taking mercy on lost mankind, is the efficient cause of our freedome, so his Son sent, is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall cause of our freedome.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Wherefore was the Son of God rather to take humane nature then the nature of Angels?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Because the purpose of God was to redeeme and<note place="margin">Heb. 2, 15. 16.</note> saue, not the Angels but mankinde: which as it doeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse the greatnes of Gods loue to man, so it must great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excite and stirre vp mans loue to God: for it is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, that men and Angels are both sinners, yet the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy was allowed to vs.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>But wherefore was the Son of God, to take mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture pure without sin?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>Because otherwise he could neither haue been made<note place="margin">Christ had not saued vs from sin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himselfe a sinner.</note> a sacrifice for vs, nor righteousnesse to vs: for had hee had our nature with the least sin, hee could not onely haue bin no Sauiour to vs, but himselfe should haue stood in neede of a Sauior, and in stead of giuing righteousnesse to others, must haue receiued righteousnes from another.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>But how was it possible to seuer sin and our nature one from the other?</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>Well enough, he that seuered them in the first <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> by creation, could tell how to seuer them in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam</hi> by incarnation; as hee will at length seuer them in all beleeuers at their glorification, sin being but an accident which may bee separated without hurt to the subiect.</p>

                     <p>Because faith, by the which we are in Christ, being an inward and hidden thing seated in the heart, may easily be counterfeited by hypocrites, who if they doe, say, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse and glory (as they are apt enough to doe) that they are in Christ; there is none can controlle them, because none can see what is within their heart.

                     <p>This moued the Apostle heere againe to mention such a witnesse of our being in Christ, which is outward and more subiect to sence, and therefore lesse apt to deceiue, namely, newnesse of life, or sanctification; which is such a thing, as without it we can neuer assure our selues that our sinnes are forgiuen by Christ, and that wee are free from condemnation. For though it bee not the proper cause of our comfort, yet it is a cause without the which we can haue no sound comfort, because it is ioyned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separably
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:20835:257"/>
with iustification: for God doth euer sanctifie by his Spirite, whom he doth iustifie by faith: also new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of life is a sure testimony of a liuely faith, which makes vs certaine of our reconciliation with God. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, newnesse of life, is a fruite of the Spirite, and it is a chiese part of our thankfulnesse to God, who is then most honoured, when his will is sincerely obeyed.</p>

                     <p>First, it reproues the hypocrites, who say they haue sanctification, and yet still walke after their owne corrupt lusts.

                     <p>A deadly thing, as before, Rom. 7, 24. Where sinne is called the body of death. The reason why sinne or the lust thereof is counted a deadly thing is, first, because it comes from such persons as are dead in trespasses and sinnes, Ephe, 2, 1. Secondly, because the lust of sin brings
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:20835:259"/>
foorth death eternall, and deserues it as a proper and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious cause of it, Rom. 6, 23.</p>

                     <p>How comes it that the sinnes which men doe heere in a short time, merit punishment which is without any limit or end?</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, because God hath so decreed it, it is his owne ordinance and appointment, that the soule that sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth shall dye, Ezek, 18, 20. Secondly, an infinite and eternall Iustice is offended by sinners. Thirdly, because sinne in wicked men growes vnto perfection, and they which follow sinfull lusts would do it for euer, if they might liue for euer.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>First, that the godly from hence are to bee warned to auoide and abhorre euery sinfull lust and desire, because it deserues death eternall: wherewith howsoeuer God will not punish the faithfull, because there is no condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to them, being in Christ; yet it standeth them much vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, greatly to take heed of louing and doing that which may make them guilty of such horrible paine in Hell fire. A wise man would not deserue the losse of his temporall life, though he were sure to be pardoned. What madnes then were it to deserue the losse of eternall life vpon hope of pardon? Secondly, the wicked from hence are also to be warned, that as they abhorre death, and would not dye and perish euerlastingly both in body and soule: so let them beware that they goe not on to fulfill their fleshly and sinfull desires of pride, couetousnesse, enuy, &amp;c. For he that is truth it selfe, hath spoken it, that the wisedome of the flesh is death, and all vncleane persons shall be cast into the burning lake, Reuel. 21, 27.</p>

                     <p>The affections and lusts of our corrupt nature: which are of two sorts.

The second sort be seated in the will, and doe flow from thence, as anger, wrath, enuy, couetousnesse, pride, emulation, &amp;c. with all the actions that proceede from such lusts.</p>

                     <p>Because carnall men are wise to doe euill, estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming it not the least wisedome to plotte and performe sinfull deeds. See before.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Enmity doth signifie an aduersary, an enemy, or one that fighteth against another. The Apostle doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther chuse to say [Enmity] then enemy, because enmity is a word of greater force and vehemency, seruing more to encrease and aggrauate the naughtinesse and hurt of sinne. For it sheweth that the lust of the flesh, doth greatly striue against God, as an extreame enemy of his. See the like speech, Phil. 1, 21. For Christ is to me both in life and in death, aduantage, or gaine, that is, very gainefull.</p>

                     <p>Doth not this enmity argue that once there was friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship betweene God the Creator, and men his Creatures?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It doth so: for there was a friendship betweene them, at the first creation of man, when God printed in mans soule, the image of himselfe, consisting in perfect knowledge, righteousnesse, and true holinesse; then did God loue man, and man did loue God againe. This friendship was broken off by the malice of Sathan, inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

the hearts of our first parents, with vnbeliefe, pride, and sinne, from whence arise this fearefull enmity, God extreamely hating man for sinne, and man through sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full affections, extreamely hating God. For sinne made a separation, and diuorced the Creator from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which were sweetly linked together in an holy and happy Communion.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>By this reason, because their flesh or corrupte nature neither is subiect to the law of God, neyther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed can be. For such coniunction is betweene God and his law, as to be enemy to eyther, makes vs enemies to both.</p>

                     <p>That they which are in the flesh, that is to say, carnall &amp; naturall men not renued by the Spirit of God, such cannot please God, but are voide of his grace, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vnder death and damnation. Moreouer, from hence doth follow euen the very quite contrary; as namely, that the wisedome of the Spirite submitteth it selfe to the law of God, being willingly subiect and obedient to it. And therefore they which are in the Spirite, endued with true holinesse by the worke of the Spirite, they do please God and are his friends, and be in his fauour free from condemnation, and are in the way that leadeth to life and peace. This contrariety and opposition, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle doth conceale, eyther because it was manifest and plaine enough to bee vnderstood; or for that the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the flesh, and the wisedome of the Spirit, doe

not cause death and life after one sort and fashion.

                     <p>This present Text serueth and helpeth vs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute errors, to instruct vs in the truth, to humble the pride of our nature, and to comfort our feeble mindes. The errors that are heere confuted, are first, such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine<note place="margin">Confutation.</note> the wisedome of the flesh to sensuality, thinking our appetite or sences, onely to be enemies to God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting his law; whereas our very reason and will are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed with sinne, and be thereby turned against God, and bent against his law. Secondly, the error of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, which condemne marriage of Ministers, because it is saide, such cannot please God, which bee in the flesh. Pope <hi>Syrtius</hi> so concluded and collected from this Text. Thirdly, the error of the <hi>Manichees,</hi> which thought that the very substance of the flesh and body, was the worke of the Diuell, and sinfull, because it is written, the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the flesh is enmity with God; whereas flesh sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth not our substance, but the vicious quality of sinne cleauing to our substance. Fourthly, the error of the <hi>Pelagians</hi> and Papists touching free will, of which they teach, that it was able to loue God and to bee subiect to his law without grace, or at the least being a little hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by Gods Spirite, it could refuse grace, or receiue it, if it list, as the Papists teach; whereas indeede our free will is dead in trespasses and sinnes, an enemy to God, and can no more without grace bee subiect to God, to loue and obey his law, or beleeue his promises, then an enemy abiding so, can or will loue his enemy, and bee subiect to him.</p>

                        <pb n="523" facs="tcp:20835:261"/>Secondly, the truths that are heere taught, are these.<note place="margin">Instruction.</note> First, that Sathans malice against mankinde, is most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame, in that hee hath poysoned not onely the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our partes of our soule, but the chiefe and most noble parts, euen our reason, minde, and will: yea, the whole heart with the contagion of sinne. Secondly, that all men naturally are in a most wretched and most wofull e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state, being enemies and rebels to God, proudly &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately bent against him, and he iustly against vs, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy vs with eternall wrath; as that subiect must needs perish, that hath the King his enemy, and that pot must needs be broken, that fighteth against the Potter.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, this Text serues to humble vs, by remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring<note place="margin">Humiliation.</note> and beleeuing, that we were once in this wretched estate, and haue in vs still some wisedom of the flesh, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling against God, Rom. 7, 22, 23.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, this Text serues to comfort vs, thus: If Christ<note place="margin">Consolation.</note> by his death reconciled vs to God, when by sin we were his enemies, hee will much more preserue vs being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to him, Rom. 5, 10. Also Rom. 8, 32. The consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration heereof, should prouoke all beleeuers to grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter loue and thankefulnesse to Christ Iesus, the greater his loue appeared in restoring vnto vs the friendship of God which we had lost by sinne.</p>

                     <p>An application of the former doctrin vnto the beleeuing and Christian Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes. For that which he before had generally taught of the sanctification of the Spirite, and of the desire and study both of spirituall and carnall men, hee doth nowe particularly apply it to the Saints at <hi>Rome,</hi> as his manner is. The summe whereof is thus much; That they which are after the flesh and carnall men, sauour the thinges of
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:20835:262"/>
the flesh wholly minding and caring for thinges that bee carnal and euill; and so they with their course of life perish as enemies to God; whereas spirituall men minde and care for spirituall and good things, pleasing God as his friends and children. From whence the Apostle doth gather, that seeing the Romanes were not in the flesh, but in the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, spirituall not carnall men: therefore they were none of Gods enemies, but his friends and children, being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled vnto him and pleasing him made partakers of his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and of his Son, and therefore free from condemnation, as he had vniuersally taught in the first verse of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

Secondly, to descend to particular applying it to the vse of euery Christian in the assembly, for teaching, confuting, reproouing, for exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and for comforting: this application is the life and soule of doctrine, and as a whetstone to set an edge on it; it is frequent in scripture.</p>

                     <p>First, to reproue such as doe interpret this clause of Mariage, as the Pope <hi>Syritius</hi> did, thereby to condemne the mariage of Ministers. Secondly, it doth admonish vs, that it is a danger alwayes to vnderstand the Scripture ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the proper signification of the words; for then wee must say, that there are men liuing that are without flesh, and bone, bloud and body; because <hi>Paul</hi> sayth here of the liuing and beleeuing Romanes, that they are not in the fleshut is therfore a figuratiue speech to be vnderstood of the corruption of nature: in Scripture <hi>Dianoia</hi> and not <hi>To rheton</hi> onely must be obserued.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, that the elect though they be borne in sinne yet doe not alwayes abide in the estate of corruption, but are translated into the estate of grace, being of meere car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall men, partly spirituall. Secondly though many at once haue both flesh and spirit in them, yet none can be both in the flesh and in the Spirite, these are such contraries as they cannot stand together. Thirdly, that it is the essentiall property and most certaine rule of a Christian, by al means to auoide the affections of the flesh, and in all things to be carried by the Spirit. Lastly, we are taught by this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, of <hi>Paul</hi> to iudge charitably of such Christians, which professe Christ and doe not thinges contrary vnto their
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:20835:263"/>
profession, that they are not carnall but spirituall. This is the cannon and rule of Charity, which indeed is not so certaine but that it may deceiue, because it cannot looke to things within, and hypocrites beare a shew of piety without substance. Therefore the spirite of discerning spirits, is a great blessing, the Apostles excelled in it.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>The first reason is this; The spirite of God dwels in you, therefore ye are not in the flesh to walke after it, but in the spirit.</p>

                     <p>The third person in the Trinity, called the Holy Ghost; and the word God, is put personally for God the Father, the first person in Trinity, of whome the spirit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth; so as he is also the spirit of the Son.</p>

                     <p>That the Holy Ghost doeth proceede from God the Father, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15, 26. As also from God the Sonne; and therefore he is in the latter part of this verse, called the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Christ.</p>

                     <p>The word (dwelling) is taken from men which dwell in houses; who doe not onely possesse their houses, but command and gouerne all things therein, at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: likewise the holy Spirite not onely filles the hearts of the faithfull, but also rules and gouernes them, enlighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them to know, and directing them to do things plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vnto God, according to the measure of the Spirite. For howsoeuer the flesh may rebell, yet the Spirite still pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesseth the godly, and hath the dominion and vpper hand.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>Not onely of the efficacy of the Spirite, but of his continuance in the faithfull vnto the end. For he is not in
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:20835:263"/>
vs as a guest to lodge for a night and be gone, but as an Inhabitant to dwell and abide in vs, euen to the death, and for euer, Iohn, 14, 23. <hi>The Spirite which I will giue you shall abide with you for euer.</hi> Therefore they are in an error, who thinke that the Spirit of Christ once had, can bee vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly lost. Indeed false doctrine and corrupt manners may hinder the working of the Spirite, but cannot extinguish the grace of the Spirite. Secondly, this word [dwelling] puts vs in minde of the presence of the Spirite in the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that it is not by immensity and infinitnesse of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eras in other Creatures, but by presence of grace and of his healthfull effects.</p>

Secondly, sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be made new Creatures, to be able to hate euill, and to loue and doe good.

                     <p>Sundry, but especially two: First, to leade vs into all truth, sufficient to our saluation. Secondly, to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and comfort our hearts vnder the Crosse. Iohn. 14.</p>

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the man which hath in him the Spirite of Christ dwelling, cannot follow and obey the lusts of the flesh, and they which be such, they haue not the Spirite of Christ dwelling in them.

                     <p>First, Christ giueth the elect his Spirite, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate them into himselfe, 1 Cor. 6, 17. Secondly, the same his spirit doth regenerate them, and quicken their soules by grace, that they may become his liuelie mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Ephes. 2, 1, 4, 5. Thirdly, vpon the elect being now become his members, hee bestoweth his benefits by his spirit, giuing them righteousnesse, holinesse, peace, ioy, and life. Fourthly, he putteth his spirit into them, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and gouerne them in the wayes of God, that they may do the workes pleasing to him. Note this, that these seuerall actions of faith and of the spirite, howsoeuer in the order of causes some go before, others followe, and some are felt of vs before others, yet in respect of time they are all wrought togither.</p>

                     <p>First we learne what a noble worke our Vnion with Christ is, vnto which are required so many seuerall actions both of faith and of the spirit. Secondly, we are taught, that this vnion is to be taught and prized aboue all things as being the foundation and roote of all that good which we haue by Christ. Thirdly, it confutes such as haue thought our vnion with Christ to haue beene a naturall commixtion of substances, his &amp; ours togither; or to be nothing else but an agreement between minds and wils, such as may bee betweene friends, or man and wife, or Prince and subiect. Lastly, it doth admonish all men what a needfull thing it is, to be endued with faith and the spirit, seeing without these there can be no vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had with Christ.</p>

profession, and before men, but before God we cannot; for it is plainly saide, <hi>If we haue not the spirit of Christ, wee are none of his.</hi> And if we neither haue Christs spirite, nor be none of his, we cannot be Christians otherwise then in name: for as a branch and a member are saide to liue so long, as they do partake in the iuice of the Vine, and life of the body, from whence beeing seuered, they are dead and withered, cut off, and cast out: so it is with vs, we haue the life of a Christian by being Christs, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his spirit, Iohn 15, 1, 2, 3.

                     <p>What profit are we to make of this point, that euerie true Christian is one with Christ, &amp; hath his spirit?</p>

                     <p>First, this reprooues such as vse to excuse their sinnes, by saying they are flesh and bloud, and not spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall; which is as much to say, as that they are no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians: for if they be of the body of Christ, they must of necessity haue his spirit, and be spirituall. Secondly, it reproues the Papists, that withhold the Scriptures from Gods people, vppon pretence that they haue not Gods spirit; they might euen as wel say that they are no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. For to be a member of Christ, and to be led by the spirit of Christ, they be things that go necessarily toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; cannot be puld asunder, no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can a liuing member of a naturall body, bee seuered from the soule; euen so can no Christian be without Christs spirit. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this reproues such as say, we must alwaies doubt, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we haue the spirit of Christ or no, which wee ought no more to doubt of, then whether wee bee Christians or no.</p>

The soule or spirit shall liue through righteousnesse imputed to the beleeuer, because hee being iustified and freed from guilt of sin, is also thereby to be absolued and set free from death eternall; which being remooued, life eternall must needs come in the roome as a necessary fruite and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of righteousnesse imputed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>The iust by faith shall liue, Rom.</hi> 5. 18. But if wee take the latter sence, then it will haue this se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, not as any meritorious cause of it: but because it is a certaine vndeceiueable signe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted righteousnesse, to which life eternall belongs: also of Christ his spirite dwelling in vs, and of our communion with Christ; al which are soundly witnessed by our vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect righteousnesse or holinesse of life; as trees known by the fruite.</p>

                     <p>It is this: Common honesty requireth that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man pay his debt: now all the faithfull are debters to the Spirite, and therefore wee are all bound to pay this debt, by liuing after the Spirite.</p>

                     <p>Two things: First, that in good order of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, exhortation must follow doctrine; the reason is, first because exhortation pierceth deeper, and sticketh longer when it is built firmely vpon the ground of some doctrine, euen as doctrine becomes more liuely, when there is an edge set vpon it, by exhortation. Secondly, from hence we are generally taught, that it is a point of honesty and iustice, to answere and satisfie our debts as it is written, Rom, 13, 8. <hi>Owe nothing to any man.</hi> Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto adde the example of the widdow, mentioned in 2. Kings, 4, 7. who being charged with many Children, yet sold her substance to pay her debt. See more tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this, vpon the Dialogue, Rom. 13. 8.</p>

                     <p>It reproues sundry sorts of people: First, such as borrow and neuer meane to pay, taking all to bee their owne, that once comes into their purse. Secondly, such as are of opinion that whatsoeuer is lent them is their owne if they neede it, neyther are they bound to restore.
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:20835:267"/>
Thirdly, such as will pay their debts, but they doe it out of a loue not to honesty, but to their own reputation. Fourth ly, such as wickedly deferre payment to the hurt of their creditours, or wholly defiaude their creditours by vniust tricks. Fiftly, such as discharge their debt but doing it with an ill will, louing them the worse which haue trusted them with their mony: that prouerbe being often fulfilled in this case: When I lent I was a friend, but when I asked I was vnkinde. Sixtly, it rebukes Ministers which pay not the debt of teaching to their people, &amp; the people that pay not their due and debt of maintenance to their teachers. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1, 14. <hi>I am a debtor to the Grecian.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 914.

Thirdly iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in that they are set free from sin &amp; eternall death, and accepted as fully righteous, by the imputation of Christs righteousnesse to them. Fourthly calling, whereby they haue beene drawne vnto the faith in Christ. Fifthly sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, whereby sinne is mortified that they may liue in newnes of life. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 11. Sixtly, all the graces and fruits <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the spirit. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22. Secondly, the benefite present, is the spirituall consolation in all afflictions, together with the gouernment and regiment of the spirit. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16, 7. <hi>Rom.</hi>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 8. 9. Thirdly, the benefits which wee hereafter looke for from the spirit, is first, dayly encrease of knowledge and all
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:20835:268"/>
other guifts of the spirit. Secondly, corrob oration in grace vnto death. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5, 10. Thirdly, quickning of their soules at their death with eternall life. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 10. Fourthly, quickning of their dead bodies at the resurrection. <hi>Rom. 6.</hi> 11. Fiftly, the glorification both of body and soule eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in heauen. These many and great benefites of the spirite, doe therefore oblige and binde the faithfull most straightly vnto this debt, not to-liue after the flesh but after the spirit, which doth so many and great things for vs.</p>

                     <p>First, if liuing godly all our life long be a debt, then it cannot be that our workes should merit with God; for that which is a debt cannot be a merit, no man merites (not thanks) to pay what he oweth. Secondly, this ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes the works of supererogation, which if they beo works of the Spirit, then we ow them of duty; and if they be not such works, then ought they not to be done. Thirdly, hence wee learne, that the doing of good workes, or the leading of a godly life is a thing necessary, though not as a meritorious cause of saluation, yet as a duty which we are bound to pay, as a debt to the spirit our benefactor. Lastly, all that liue after the spirit, will bee obedient to the worde of God; &amp; the more obedient wee are to the word of God, the more we liue after the spirit: for the spirit &amp; the word are coupled togither by firme connexion. The worde is<note place="margin">Esay 59. 21.</note> vnderstood and obeyed by sanctification of the spirit; and the holy Spirite perswadeth to that onely which is conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the word.</p>

                     <p>Newe reasons to enforce the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer exhortation of liuing after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and not after the flesh that is of leading a holy life; the reasons bee three. The first is from the vnprofitablenesse, or danger if we doe liue after the flesh, then wee shall dye. Secondly, from the profit which will follow, if we doe liue after the Spirit; then wee shall liue. The third is from the facility and easinesse, because through the grace of the

                     <p>To follow and obey the corrupt motions of our blinde reason and peruerse will. The danger heereof is death: now all men naturally abhorre death, as a most fearefull thing. Therefore as we would abhorre such a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable and horrible effect as death, wee must bee carefull that we liue not after the flesh, but that we obey the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>Not onely the naturall death which is common vnto all, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which euen the godliest are not exempted, but must dye at the last. Againe, this death is so farre from terrifying some of the godly, that it giueth them much ioy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and is a thing most desired of them; and therefore these words are not to be vnderstood of a corporall death alone, which is the dissolution of nature, but it may partly be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of a naturall death when it is inflicted vpon the godly, as a iudgement of some lust of the flesh, which they haue too much followed. As it hapened to <hi>Moyses, Aaron, Iosias, Ely, Numb.</hi> 27, 12, 13. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32, 49, 50, 51. 2. <hi>Kings.</hi> 23, 29. 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 33, 34, &amp; 4, 11, 18. Also the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet mentioned, 1. Kings, 13, 24. Yea sometimes the obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some lust of the flesh, doth cost Gods children deare from the hand of ciuill iustice, as happened to some that perished in the wildernesse, 1. Cor. 10, 5. and to sundry others daily amongst our selues, who come vnto publike and shamefull death, for some worke of the flesh which they haue done, and yet no doubt are the faithful Children of God; as it did befall the Theefe vpon the Crosse. But that death which is heere chiefely to be meant, is eternall death, which is the casting out of the whole man, both bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and soule from Gods presence, to suffer Hell torments for euer and euer.</p>

                     <speaker>Sylas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, as the blessednesse of heauen is called life in scripture, because of all things life is most pleasant: so the miseries of hell are called death, because death of althings is very miserable &amp; most shunned. Secondly, though the wicked do liue in hell, yet because they are separated from God who is life, and because they so liue, as that they are euer dying, therefore it is worthily called death.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>The instructions are two, the former concernes the wicked, the latter the godly: for the former, the wicked are heere admonished, that if they are obedient vnto the flesh &amp; liue wickedly, doing what sin comma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, they must dye and perish for euer, if they continue so, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. 9,</hi> 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 20, 21. <hi>Reue.</hi> 21. 8. the reason hereof is because the wisedome of the flesh is death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 6. also because the wages of sin is death <hi>Rom. 6.</hi> 23.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <p>What is the vse of this instruction?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It affoords an admonition to all such as doe liue in the seruice of any fleshly lust, to forsake it betimes and earnestly, as they doe couet not to be destroyed perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; if this moue not, yet let them forsake their euill course, least they shorten their naturall life, and purchase to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues a reproachfull death, by being giuen ouer to some crime that shall deserue it.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>What instruction may bee giuen from hence to the godly?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>This, that howsoeuer they are free from condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by faith in Christ, yet the meditation of eternall death is profitable for them: the reason here of is, because the godliest men haue still some flesh and sinne abiding in them, yea the most haue more sin than grace. Heereof it followes that they are neuer free from blemishes and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall slothfulnes, security, presumption and prophanenes; against which, the consideration of hell paines is a good remedy; because the more Gods fierce iustice and wrath
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:20835:270"/>
be thought vpon and feared, the more carefull men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to auoid the former and all other sinnes. The Papists doe vs wrong in charging vs to wish men not to leaue sin for feare of Hell fire.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>What profit is to be made of this latter instruction?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, it reproueth the godles, who do not thinke it needfull often to thinke of Hell fire, or bee afraide so to doe, least it trouble them; better now to be feared with it, then heereafter to feele it. Secondly, it admonisheth all Gods Children much and very earnestly to consider the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of the damned, if they desire to liue holily after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. Cor. 5, 9, 10. 2. Tim. 4, 1, 2. It is <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostomes</hi> counsell, that at banquets and feastes and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like meetings, men should talke of hellish paines, that they may be awed, and auoide them.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Proceed now to the words, which containe the second reason, and tell vs what is meant heere by the deeds of the body, and what is it to mortifie them?</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>By deeds of the body, we are to vnderstand the same whichelse where are called the lusts of the flesh, the workes of darknesse, euen all sinfull motions and deeds which spring from the minde, and are executed by the body: and [<hi>mortifie</hi>] signifies to suppresse and keep them downe by the power of the Spirite, that they doe not flourish and raigne in vs, as a King to command and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne vs.</p>

                     <p>Foure wayes: First, it doth detect and discouer sinfull thoughts and actions. Secondly, it stirres vp a griefe for them, and hatred of them. Thirdly, it kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles feruent prayer to get strength against them. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it brings to mind sentences of the word, which are as

a sword to cut downe sinne. Lastly it makes watchful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sinne, to auoide all occasions of it, and to vse all sanctified meanes against it.</p>

                     <p>That the life of euery godly person must bee a continuall mortification and repentance.

                     <p>That sinfull lusts are not to bee mortified, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then by the grace of the Spirit, without which it is impossible to subdue them, &amp; by which it will be found verie easie to tame them.

Thirdly, it admonisheth all men to seeke for strength against sin at the hands of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Lastly, the Spirit vseth our endeauours as a means of iustification.

This is proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by a reason drawne from the efficiene cause, to wit, from the right of sonnes after this sort: Sons are heires of their fathers goodes, euen of eternall life in heauen, verse 17. but the beloeuing <hi>Romanes,</hi> and all other the faithfull which liue holy, are the sonnes of God, verse 14, 16. therefore al such as leade a holy life, shall liue for euer with God.</p>

Secondly, an illumination from the Spirite, to see and know such instructions to be from God himselfe, Thirdly, inclination and bowing of the will voluntarily to will, and readily to obey such diuine instructions. For as the Spirite doth not enlighten vs, but by the word expounded and opened: so it is in vaine to know what we should doe by the light of the Spirite and word, vnlesse will and strength be giuen vs to do it. And it were not enough to haue will and strength giuen vs to do it, if we want knowledg of that which we are to do. Therefore vnto leading, these three things be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, first, to be instructed by the word, secondly, to bee enlightned by the Spirit in our mindes, and thirdly to be mightily strengthened in our wils and affections, that we will well effect what we doe soundly affect.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First of all, that this is an vndoubted and vnfal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible marke of the sonne of God, to be led by the Spirite of God, in such manner as is before declared: euen as the sonnes of Sathan are knowne by this, that they are ledde by the flesh, following and obeying their owne corrupt hearts, and dooing the will of the Diuell their father, Iohn, 8, 44. so Gods sonnes are discerned heereby, that they striue to bee obedient to the Spirite and worde of God their heauenly Father, beeing much greeued and humbled when they slippe and leaue the direction of the Holy-Ghost, beeing very heedfull and wary for after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

                     <p>First, the Spirite moues Christians to bee holy

and iust in their counselles and meditations, heauenly and deuine; and carrieth them to thinges vnpleasant and quite contrarie to the flesh, yet such as bee acceptable to God: but it is quite otherwise with the flesh, which moueth men to things which are vnrighteous and wicked, earthly, vain and hatefull to God. Secondly, it is knowne by those fruites of the Spirit and flesh, mentioned in <hi>Gala.</hi> 5, 19. 20. &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>The second reason to proue beleeuers to bee the Sonnes of God; which is, inuocation or calling vpon God by prayer with child-like confidence, as vpon a most louing and most mercifull Father. This argument is drawn from an adioynt or property of the Sonne of God; for all they and none other then they, can call vppon God with a filiall and child-like trust and confidence. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer whereas <hi>Paul</hi> had said of all the Sonnes of God, that they are ledde by the Spirite of God: nowe hee declareth what Spirite that is wherewith they are ledde and gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, to wit, the spirit of adoption, which is heere set foorth by the contrary, to wit, by the spirit of bondage and feare: and also by the effects; to wit, feruency and earnestnes in prayer, whereby we cry Abba Father.</p>

                     <p>The third person in the Trinity, euen the Holy Ghost, which before was called the Spirit of God and of Christ. Note this, that although the Apostle maketh heere mention of the Spirit of feare and of adoption, yet the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit of God is but one; but this one spirit hath sundry effectes and workings, euen in the selfe same persons, as appeareth in the example of these beleeuing Romanes: in whome the spirite of God first of all brought forth feare: their conscience trembling like bond-men before their Lord and Iudge; and afterwards adoption and liberty: so as they could speak and pray to God, as children to a most kind Father. Whereof we are admonished by this particle
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:20835:274"/>
[againe] ye haue not receiued [againe;] giuing to wit that before they were conuerted, the spirite engendred feare and much dread in them: but nowe they were conuerted, they had receiued another effect of the spirit, to wit; liberty and boldnesse by the assurance of their adoption. The marke which the Apostle aimes at in all this, is to moue the godly not onely to doe the wil of God and please him; but to doe it willingly and readily, being made his Sonnes by adoption, and free from all feare and bondage, they were deliuered from the handes of their enemies, to serue God in true righteousnes and holines without feare. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.</p>

                     <p>First, we are taught how miserable we are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we being the children of Gods wrath and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, liuing alwayes as bondmen in fear of his punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Eph. 2, 1, 2, 3. Secondly, we are taught how need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full it is to haue Gods Law soundly opened and applyed vnto vs, seeing we haue not the Spirit of adoption, till we haue the Spirit of feare, and this is gotten by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery of the Law.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, we are warned what duties men are to do vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hearing and reading the Law, that they may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their owne conuersion, which be these: First, by the Law, to get distinct and sound knowledge of sin, Rom. 3, and 7, 7. Secondly, rightly to vnderstande what that curse is, which the Law threatneth vnto sinne &amp; sinners. Thirdly, a diligent search and examination of our selues, whether we be not guilty of these very sinnes, against which the law denounceth the wrath and curse of God. Fourthly, Legall faith, beleeuing that we are breakers of the Law, and do deserue the curse of the Law. Lastly, vpon the application of the Law to our selues, to labour and worke our owne hearts, to get them humbled and broken with feare and terror of Gods iudgements. For then, and not before, the heart is made meet to receyue the Spirit of Adoption. Heere are reproued such as ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther too much hope from the Gospell, ere the Law haue duly feared and taken them downe with griefe &amp; shame.</p>

                     <p>Adoption is the making one actually a son by grace, which is no sonne by nature, Ephe. 2, 3. Gal. 4, 4, 5. For this word (Adoption,) is borrowed from the custome of men, who being Childlesse doe adopt and take to them of fauour the childe of another to bee their sonne. This benefit of Adoption, may be declared many waies: First, by the person of him who adopteth, to wit; God, who hauing a naturall Son, yet wanting sonnes in our kinde, hath Adopted men &amp; woemen to be his Children; which is not the wont among men, but quite contrary. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by the persons of vs who are Adopted, beeing both beggerly, and void of all goodnesse, being also his enemies, full of all vnrighteousnes, Rom. 5, 6, 7, 8. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the dignity of the thing, it being a matter of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous excellency to haue such a sonne-ship, more a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times then to be the sonne of a most mighty Prince. Fourthly, by the manifold and exceeding benefits which comes by Adoption, namely, to bee heire of the world and of Heauen. Lastly, by the duty of adopted ones, being briefly touched in Malachy, 1, 6. and more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in 1. Pet. 1, 14, 15.</p>

                     <p>The first is, to seale or assure in the hearts of the elect children of God, the witnesse of their adoption by Christ: hence it is called the Spirit of Adoption, and in the same sence also it is tearmed the earnest of our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, Ephes. 1, 14. The second is, to open their mouths with childlike confidence and godly feruency, to pray vnto God, as to a most louing father.

                     <p>By the Ministery and preaching of the Gospell, as the Spirit of feare and bondage, is giuen by the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Law. Hence the Gospell preached, is called the Ministry of life, of righteousnesse, and of the Spirit, because through the Ministry of the Gospell, the Spirit is effectuall to quicken the dead hearts of the elect, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Faith in Christ, thereby to be made righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and to become his sonnes, and heires of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life.

                     <p>The Spirit of Adoption is receiued into the harts of the elect by these degrees, or seuerall works of grace. First, after the Conscience is humbled and terrified by the Lawe, being brought to see and feele an extreame neede of Christ crucified, there is engendered an earnest desire and longing after him and his merites, such as is in hungry men after meate, and thirsty men after drink, or wearied men after rest, or in the sicke after health. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, this desire is accompanied with an vnfaigned confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:20835:276"/>
of particuler sinnes, so farre as be knowne to vs, and hearty bewayling of the deepe miserie due vnto them. Thirdly, there is wrought a perswasion, that all their sinnes how great and many soeuer, be pardonable, being farre inferiour to the infinite mercies of God, &amp; merites of Christ. Fourthly, there followes an earnest and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant crauing of the forgiuenesse of them all. Lastly, there commeth the gift of a liuely faith, assuring the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that all are forgiuen, and they fully reconciled vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, whence ariseth great peace and rest with liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and freedom to the soule. And this faith in Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is the testimony of the Spirit, all which is shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out by the parable of the lost childe, who felt a great neede of his Fathers reconciliation, much desired it, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed himselfe vnworthy of it, despaired not to finde it, earnestly begged it with perswasion of it.</p>

                     <p>It doth expell all seruile feare (though not vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) as it is written, <hi>Perfect loue casts out feare,</hi> 1 Iohn 4, 18. but it engendereth filiall feare, as it is written, <hi>There is mercy with thee, that thou maist be feared,</hi> Psal. 130, 4. The adopted children of God haue then a mixt feare, as they are not wholly free from feare of hell fire; which serues them as a bridle and curbe to awe them and restraine them from sin: yet they chiefely feare him, because they would not offend his infinite goodnesse. This feare is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten commanded, and they are often exhorted vnto it, &amp; it hath many promises made to it in the word.</p>

                     <p>Especially by that effect of calling vpon God; for whereas the elect before they had this Spirite of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, were afraide of God, and did flye from him, as from a most terrible Iudge, (example whereof, we haue in <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> after their fall.

<pb n="560" facs="tcp:20835:277"/>
by grace, the Spirite of God doth open their mouths to pray vnto God as children vnto a father, with holy boldnesse, Gal. 4, 5. The reason heereof is, because they being certaine that their sinnes bee forgiuen them, and that God who was their enemy is reconciled, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may freely speake vnto him, aa one friend vnto another, and God is as ready to heare them, as a father is to heare his owne deare Child. Yea farre more ready to heare, then his children are to aske, preuenting their prayers oftentimes, and alwaies granting them.</p>

                     <p>True: yet Gods children alone can in truth say, Abba father, and in their prayers cry to God.

                     <p>There confidence doth spring first from the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, he being pacified towards them in his Son. Secondly, from the truth of God, promising to heare them for his Sons sake. Thirdly, from the merit of Christs intercession, to whome the Father will deny nothing. Their feruency also doth arise first from a true and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular sight and sense of their owne sinnes and miseries: and secondly, from the sound knowledge and meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the excellency of Gods graces, which the more they are knowne and valued, are the more cagerly thirsted af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and desired.</p>

                     <p>First, the godly are instructed in all their prayers to prouoke themselues to earaest zeale and assiance, by thinking seriously vpon the infinite mercies and promises of God; the mediation of Christ, and their own sinnes and miseries. Secondly, whensoeuer Gods childeren pray without consideration of these thinges, they must needes pray vncomfortably and with weake confidence. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from hence we may see that the prayers which be made to Saints, to the Virgine Mary, and to Angels, that they come not from the Spirite of adoption, which directs vs to pray vnto the Father: but from a spirit of errour being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a doctrine of diuels. Fourthly, because we haue our adoption from Christ and his spirit: therefore no vngodly men, as Turkes and Iewes, can call vpon God. Fiftly, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the godly are certain of God to be their Father: there fore they may be also certaine of their adoption, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently of their saluation, because sonnes be heires. The sonnes of this world cannot be so certaine of their Father, as the faithfull bee of theirs. Sixtly, by the change of the person (<hi>wee haue</hi>) the Apostle woulde teach euery one to hope well of the adoption of other Christians, and to bee assured of their owne, hauing the testimony of the Spirit &amp; of Christ, teaching them to call God, Father. Seauenthly, the expressing of the name Father, both by the Hebrewe<note place="margin">Abba.</note> and Greeke words, teacheth that God is Father both of<note place="margin">Pater.</note> the Iewes and Gentiles, which are indifferently partakers (through faith) of this adoption. Lastly, because <hi>Paul</hi> v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth heere this strange worde (Abba) wee cannot gather thence that the seruice of God should be in a strange tong, as the Papists affirme directly against Gods commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 19.

It is of great worth and excellency, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it tendeth to gaine certainety of a thing which is of al other most precious: to wit, our adoption and Son-ship, euen of our right to the kingdome of heauen, that most glorious inheritance. Also it is a case of importance and waight, because it doeth behooue and import men very much to know how they hold their earthly inheritance; it must needs then greatly concerne Gods children to haue ready their euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces of their heauenly inheritance. Again, it is a very haynous offence for any Christian to call God

Father, and not to feele assuredly that hee is his Childe: but of custome and in hypocrisie, with his tongue onely and not in truth; which is farre more greeuous and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, then if one should counterfeit himselfe the sonne<note place="margin">As in <hi>Martine Marbecke,</hi> that fained himselfe to be Edward. 6.</note> of an earthly king, which yet is a capitall crime: and yet furthermore it is of great consequence and vse, for it wil stay and strengthen the heart in soule-temptation and conflict. Also it will quicken to a chearefull performance of duties: and lastly, it will nourish hope and patience in all afflictions.

                     <p>By same spirite is meant the spirite of adoption, spoken of in the former verse, euen the holy Spirite; it doth giue testimony to Gods Children, of their owne adoption, and the witnesse of the Spirite is a motion of a soule resting steadily on the mercies of God thorough Christ, inspired and stirred vp by the Spirite.</p>

                     <p>These two wayes ordinarily, (not by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary reuelation,) but first by that cry (mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) stirred vp in the hearts of the faithfull by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, which mouing them effectually to call God their Father with filiall and childlike trust in his goodnesse, heereby they are assured of their adoption. None can say, Iesus is the Lord, but by the Spirite of God, 1. Cor.
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:20835:279"/>
12, 6. Likewise none can truly call God his Father, but by the motion of the spirit of Adoption. Whosoeuer therefore in their Prayers, can call God their Father in truth, they may thereby be perswaded that he is so, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spirit of adoption is peculiar to Gods sonnes, as in verse 14. we haue learned. Thus <hi>Chrysostom</hi> expounds &amp; declares this witnesse, of the cry of the heart engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by Gods Spirit. Secondly, the Spirit beareth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse by a practick Sillogisme, or reason, framed thus:<note place="margin">2 Proposition</note> Euery beleeuer is the Childe of God, and shalbe saued.<note place="margin">2.

                     <p>First, because it is the Spirit of truth, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie and deceiue, Iohn 14, 17. Titus 1, 2. Secondly, this holy Spirit searcheth all thinges, euen the deepe things of God, 1 Cor. 2, 10. Thirdly, he is Lord of all, &amp; therefore worthy of credit and beleefe. If a man, or An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, or Archangell, should preach vnto vs this adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we might doubt of it: but seeing the Spirit, who is Lord of all doth witnesse it, what place is there of doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, saith <hi>Chrysostom?</hi>

                     <p>But how may a godly Christian discerne this witnes of Gods Spirit, from the delusion of Satan, and from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption<note place="margin">The truth, po wer, &amp; mercy of God the promiser, cause me to be of good hope.</note> of Hypocrites and wicked men?</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>By these waies: First, by the grounds &amp; reasons of the witnesse, which are not mans own merit, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon graces, or outward blessings, but they be the truth, power, and mercy of God the Father; also the merits of Christ the Sonne, and the workes and fruits of this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit<note place="margin">Bernard.</note>
                        <pb n="565" facs="tcp:20835:279"/>
of Adoption. These are such firme grounds, as cannot possibly faile him, who rests on them. Secondly, by the manner of the testimony, which is certaine and firme, as an earnest or seale putting vs out of doubt, setling the<note place="margin">Ephes. 1, 13.</note> conscience in such quiet and sound tranquilitie, as farre differeth from numbnesse and deadnesse of hypocrites, and of ciuill men. Thirdly, by the effectes of this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, as 1. Ardent prayer, 2. Sincere loue of God and our Brethren for his sake, 3. Willing and constant obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Godward: vnto which, we may ioyne these sixe meanes following, as good helpes to descry this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. First, presumption is naturall from our birth, but this testimony of the Spirit is supernaturall, and is not in vs before the grace of conuersion. Secondly, this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony ariseth from the vse of holye meanes, as hearing, reading, Sacraments, &amp;c. and is thereby confirmed; whereas presumption is from security, and not from the vse of meanes, which presumptious persons neglect or contemne.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, presumption is most confident, neuer doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting or making question of election or saluation. This Testimony of the Spirit, is much assaulted with doubts and feares, more or lesse, at one time or other, as in <hi>Iob</hi> and <hi>Dauid.</hi> Therefore he that saith I neuer doubted, I thanke God I haue alwayes had a strong beleefe, hee speakes from presumption. Fourthly, presumption is c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ioyned with worldlinesse and prophanenesse: but this Testimony is neuer seuered from a desire to liue ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily and righteously. Fiftly, presumption presumes of Gods loue, in the time of Gods benefits onely, but in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitity vanisheth. This testimony is constant and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent, in aduersity aswell as in prosperity. Lastly, this testimony of the Spirite, commeth by the application of faith; also it throughly perswadeth, and giueth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a bare Testimony, 1 Cor. 2, 12. Ephes. 1, 17, 18. 1. Iohn 3, 24.</p>

Also if our hearts do not condemne vs, we haue boldnesse towards God, 1 Iohn 3, 21.

Secondly, in their iudgement they approoue it and esteeme it aboue pearles. Thirdly, in their mindes they marke and heede it well. Fourthly, in their hearts they beleeue it.

Secondly, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to keepe it holy, Exod. 20, 8.

And his workes of mercy vpon themselues and others, moue them to loue him, and to trust in his name, Psal. 116, 1. Acts. 4, 31.</p>

                     <p>Touching the Brethren, they doe vnfainedly loue them, whether they be friends or enemies, and especially witnesse their loue in praying for them, and seeking and helping forward their saluation, and giuing thankes vnto God for their graces: also by pittying and releeuing their miseries, Luke, 6, 30. Rom. 10, 1. 1. Thes. 1, 2, 3. 1. Iohn. 3, 14, 17. And touching Christian religion: First, they fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uently loue it. Secondly, they endeauour to promote and further it. Thirdly, they hate whatsoeuer is contrary vnto it. And lastly, they study to adorne it, by expressing the power of it, and walking according to the rules of it. Psa. 119, 128. 1. Tim. 6. 1.

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, touching their owne sinnes if they be past, they are ashamed of them, Romanes. 6, 21. If they be present they haue a godly sorrow and earnest strife against them, 2. Cor. 7, 10. Rom. 7, 23. And lastly for sinnes to come, they are afraide to fall into them, and haue a great care to preuent

                     <p>Touching the ioyes of Heauen they haue hope, and a certaine and constant looking for them, Rom. 8, 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 28. <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 13. Also they haue great ioy of heart, vnder the hope of enioying heauenly glory. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 2.

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Let such for their comfort haue recourse to the least measure of sanctifying graces, which consists in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of their sinnes; euen in this respect that they are an offence to their good God. Secondly, a hearty desire of hoping and beleeuing the forgiuenesse of their sinnes, and aboue all other things that they may bee in Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and not onely that they may be happy in heauen.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, let them not despaire. Secondly, let them waite vppon GOD in the vse of all apppointed meanes. Thirdly, let them abstaine from the outwarde act of sinne, and keep downe their inward desires as much as they can. Lastly, let them often humble themselues by a particular confession of their knowne sinnes, and earnest prayer for pardon of them. For he that is not called now may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to morrow: who knoweth what a day may bring forth? Gods infinite power woorkes mightily, and sodainly, and his mercies bee bottomlesse; therefore cast not hope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>

                     <p>To conclude the maine argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reason, by which the Apostle before did exhort the Romanes, by the spirit to mortifie the deeds of the flesh. This argument was taken from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent which shall follow them, which liue after the spirite and not after the flesh, namely eternall life giuing to wit, that such shall liue for euer, because they are the sonnes of God: from hence the Apostle now concludeth, that if such as walke after the Spirit bee sonnes, then they must inherit euerlasting life in heauen: for all Gods children be heires, and haue right to the heritage of heauen.

                     <p>Two-fold: It is the inheritance eyther of glory, or of dominion and power. The inheritance of glory is this, that after his death he being risen and ascended into Heauen, he liueth there most blessedly and gloriously, his body and soule being wholy freed from all infirmities and temptations, and filled with all ioy and glorious brightnes, euen like the Sunne in the Firmament: also his inheritance of dominion and power consists in this, that in his humane nature he is exalted and listed vp aboue all principalities and powers, and euery name that is named in earth, hauing all creatures and the Church it selfe subiect to him, as vnto their head, Ephe. 2, 21, 22. Phil. 2, 9. Notwithstanding al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that the elect be partakers of this double inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Christ, yet they are not partakers in equall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: For Christ raigneth in Heauen as Gods onely and first begotten, but the faithfull are but adopted children, Phil. 3, 21. Reuel. 3, 21. Reuel. 2, 26. Rom. 8, 29.

                     <p>Secondly, they giue an Helmet or Anchor, to wit, their Hope, which stayes their soules against all the Waues of temptation, Heb. 6, 19. Thirdly, they giue a Lyon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their Christian fortitude, despising all threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and dangers, Prou. 28, 1. <hi>The Righteous are bolde as a Lyon.</hi>

vnto such as are vnder the Crosse, and suffer for Christ. Hitherto hath continued the first part of the chap ter, wherein blessed <hi>Paul</hi> hath ministred comforte to the faithfull, against the remainder of their sinfull corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and earnestly exhorted them to the diligent mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of all their sinfull lustes and corruptions, not to beare with these, though they feare no condemnation from them.

                     <p>Hee had saide a little before that the sonnes of God are sure for euer to liue in heauenly glory, now he proueth it by a fresh and new reason, taken from the vse of afflictions, that the beleeuing Romanes and other the sons of God shall be inheritors, because they haue taken vp their Crosse. This reason may bee framed two waies, and both very good. First, by inferring the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequence or that which comes after, by an antecedent, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily goeth before, as thus: They which shall be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in Heauen must suffer afflictions heere for Christ: But yee Romanes which are the sonnes of God, doe suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer afflictions for Christ; ye are therefore sure to be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified with him. The strength of this reason dependeth vpon the authority of the worde of God affirming that such as dye with Christ, shall raigne with him, and that such as suffer with him shall bee glorified with him, 2. Tim. 2, 12. Which is the selfe same thing, which is here saide in our text, if (with that great learned man) <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> wee reade (as wee may) for these words (if so be,) seeing that or because. The second way how this reason may be framed, is by a reasoning fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lesse vnto the greater, after this fashion. If ye bee partakers with Christ in his Crosse and in his sufferings, yee shall much
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:20835:285"/>
more be partakers with him in his kingdome and glory. Thus <hi>Chrysostom</hi> gathereth the argument.</p>

                     <p>Two: First, it doth admonish vs what the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; state of the Children of God is in this life, is name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, that that way which Christ passed from this life into his glory, by the same way must they passe this life vnto glory, euen by tribulations and afflictions; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is very plentifull proofe in many places of the Scripture, as Math. 10, 37. Luke 14, 26. Acts 14. 22. 2 Tim. 3, 12. Heb. 12, 5, 6. The causes why Gods will is to haue it so, are sundry and many, but these are the chiefe. First for the triall of their Faith in God, and also of their loue<note place="margin">The ends and vses of the Crosse. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Rom. 5, 3, 4. Thirdly, for the mortification and beating downe of their rebellious stubborne nature, which had neede to be suppressed and tamed by the meanes of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions. Fourthly, for the weaning and pulling theyr hearts from the immoderate louing of earthlie thinges. Fiftly, to humble their hearts before God, and to stirre them vp vnto a more feruent prayer, Iob 33, 16, 17, 18. Sixtly, that God may haue a better occasion to manifest his great power and goodnesse in strengthning their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, 2 Cor. 12. 9. and in deliuering them out of all their troubles. Lastly, the more certainly to confirme their minds in a perswasion of hauing eternal life by like nesse and conformity vnto Christ in his sufferings, Rom. 8, 29.</p>

                     <p>First it controlleth and conuicteth them of error, that thinke and teach that the children of God may fall from the grace of adoption; for that grace of God which adopteth them, so supporteth and strengtheneth their will, that they sticke and holde close to him, in most dangerous afflictions, vntill they be glorified of him in Heauen. Secondly, it reproueth such Christians as<note place="margin">

Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it admonisheth al true Christians before hand to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their soules for the day of afflictions, after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of Christ, and according to the example of a wise builder, and prouident King, as in Luke, 14, 28, 31. Lastly, it serues to comfort all such as doe, or heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after shall suffer any affliction in worde or deede, for the name of Christ; because they are in such an estate as God hath allotted his owne Children, whom he purposeth to glorifie in heauen euerlastingly.</p>

                     <p>It doth giue vs a double consolation against the sharpnesse of the crosse and afflictions: the former is from the communion of Christs sufferings; Christians suffer not alone, but they suffer with Christ, and Christ with them: which surely is no small comfort, to haue Christ a companion and fellow in our sufferings, as it were to beare vp an end of the Crosse; nay which is more, euen to suffer in vs, accounting all that cruelty which is done to his members, to bee done to him-selfe, as Acts, 9, 4. <hi>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</hi> and Mat. 25, 40.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>By these two things: First, if we suffer with the same affection that Christ suffered with, that is, of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the will of our heauenly Father, Mat. 26, 39.

afflictions, because how sharp soeuer they be, yet they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee long; for they cannot continue longer then the space of this present life, and the dayes of our life are but few, and our time but short, euen as a spanne long, or as a watch in the night.

                     <p>It doth not onely encourage Christians which do continue in afflictions, but it doeth reproue such as faint before the ende of this life: these persons to auoide a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentany and light crosse, do loose an immortall waight of glory.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That is to say, they are not equall, or of so much moment and waight, as to bee compared with heauenly glory: it is a speech borrowed from thinges put into the balance to bee waighed therein; amongst which, those which be heauiest, draw to their side the balance with their waight. So then the meaning is, that afflictions and glory being put togither, as it were in a balance, afflictions would be found to be too light, and to come farre short in worth and price, vnto that glory which is to come.</p>

                     <p>In what things are afflictions vnequall to glory?</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>In two things, both in quantity and quality; first<note place="margin">Quality.</note> they be vnequall in quality, because afflictions are but bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter troubles here on earth, before the world: but our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is a heauenly blessed estate before God. Secondly, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions bee sharpe euils which wee feele with griefe: but the glory not onely swallowes vp the euill and the griefe: but filleth vs with all good things most perfectly. They<note place="margin">Quantity.</note> be also vnequal in quantity, both for number, for measure, and for continuance; for our afflictions are fewe, but the ioyes of heauen are innumerable, more then the starres in the heauen. Also afflictions are but light, but there is a waight of glory which is vnmeasurable. Lastly, afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are but short and momentary, but the glory is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:20835:286"/>
euen for euer and euer, and to last so long as God doth last.</p>

                     <p>Why is it sayd of this glory, that it shall be reuealed, and not that it is reuealed?</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Because the godly now doe see it and enioy it but in part, whereas it shall bee manifested, and possessed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly in the end of the world; vnto which the future tense hath respect.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>The doctrine is this; all the afflictions which the<note place="margin">4 Doctrine.</note> godly doe or can suffer in this world, are vnworthy to bee<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> compared to the glory of heauen, the reasons here of bee; because there is no comparison between a thing finite and a thing infinite. Secondly, because the afflictions which be suffered, are not incomprehensible, as is the glory which the Saintes shall enioy; which made one of the Fathers to say, If I could perfourme all thinges, and suffer all the euils which euer any man did, yet all this could not make mee worthy of heauenly glory, <hi>Origen.</hi>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First of all it doth conuict the Papists of errour,<note place="margin">5 Vse.</note> in that they teach that our sufferings for Christ doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue heauenly glory: for this is quite against these words of Scripture, which say that afflictions are not woorthy of the glory; also they cannot deserue by merit the glory, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no proportion betweene affliction and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but betweene merit and reward giuen to merite, there must be a proportion; for the recompence of a merit is an act or worke of iustice (saith <hi>Thomas Aquinas,</hi>) but iustice is equality, therefore no merite, where there is vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality. Secondly, from hence also is ouerthrowne, the Popish errour of meriting by good workes done after grace, because to suffer with Christ is a worke of more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent vertue, then to do good things; therefore if our suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings deserue nothing, our doings deserue lesse. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, here is consolation to such as nowe are, or euer shall
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:20835:287"/>
be vnder the Crosse for Christs or the Gospels sake, to make them cheerefull to beare little euils, vnder hope of a greater good; as Marriners which in a tempest doe cast away their goods to saue their liues, and as heathen men spent their liues for earthly glory and reputation sake: how much more would this bee done for celestiall glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Yea, but some beleeuing afflicted Christians might say to Paul, We haue suffered much and long, but we see in stead of glory, more and more shame.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Yet we must possesse our soules with patience, for the glory shall fully be reuealed: now our life is hid with Christ, but when Christ shall appeare, we shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare with him in glory; the whilest we are not vtterly voyd of celestiall glory. For we beleeue the promise of it by faith, and possesse it after a sort by hope, and haue the beginnings or first fruites therof, in the gifts of sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification; which is glorification inchoatiuely, as glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is sanctification absolutely and most perfectly.</p>

                     <p>His drift and purpose is, first to prooue heauenly<note place="margin">Drift.</note> glory which followes afflictions, in this life, to bee cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: and secondly to exhort Gods children to be pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in afflictions, vnder hope of that glory. The former is proued by a secret and very great desire, which things<note place="margin">Summe.</note> created, haue after the glory of Gods Children till it bee manifested. Now this desire being put into them of God, it cannot be frustrate and vaine, and therefore the glory must needs be certaine. The latter is prooued by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the cretures bearing their misery, (vnder which they are through mans fault) in hope of restoring: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much more ought Gods Children patiently to suffer
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:20835:287"/>
their afflictions, seeing our restoring shall be farre more excellent then the restoring of the creatures: and there comes no afflictions vpon vs from God, but they are by our sinnes most iustly deserued; whereas the creatures suffer for our sake.</p>

                     <p>It setteth forth these two things vnto vs: First,<note place="margin">Part.</note> the condition of the creatures, both in respect of their present misery, which is heere signified by the names of vanity, corruption, and bondage, verse 20, 21. Also of their futher restauration, which is heere called deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, glory, liberty, verse 21. The second thing is the affection of the creature, in regarde both of the misery, and restoring of them. This affection is declared both for the kinde and measure of it, by the tearmes of feruent desire, waiting, groning, trauelling in paine, verses 19, 22.</p>

For he putteth vpon the creature the person of one who most desirously ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth and looketh after some person or thing; such are wont to put foorth their heads, and to looke when such persons or things should appeare, Psal. 121, 1.

                     <p>It is a certaine instinct, or inclination put into them of God, whereby they secretly (after a manner vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to vs) are moued to couet to attaine to the end for which they were made. This ende is that perfection and most glorious estate in which the creature was at first created, and from which it is now fallen for mans sinne, and vnto which it still tendeth by a naturall desire, euen as heauy things by natural propension tend down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and light things vpwards.</p>

                     <p>The meaning is, vntill that glory which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the sons of God, be indeed manifested: the sons of God (by a Metonymy of the subiect for the adioynt) are put for the glorious liberty that is ordained for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as verse 21. expounds it.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>A two-fold instruction: First, that the glory of<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> Heauen is most certaine &amp; sure, it is not doubtfull whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be such a thing or no, or a thing in aduenture, but there is such a thing indeed: and it shall be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed to all Gods Children which beleeue the<note place="margin">Reason.</note> promises, and repent of their sinnes. The reason heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is because God hath inspired the creatures with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct and desire after the glory of Gods sonnes; and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God doth nothing in vaine, it must needs bee that this desire is after some-thing that truely is, and not a Chimera or fiction.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Such as are Gods children by adoption, must<note place="margin">Vse.</note> learne from hence to strengthen their faith, as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the truth and certainty of their glory to come, if haply any doubt through temptation should arise about it. Secondly, it informes our iudgements about the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of the creature, what it shall bee after this world is ended, that they shall after their sort and manner be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the glory of Gods sonnes, for otherwise they should desire it in vaine.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Seeing the creatures doe greedily and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally<note place="margin">2. Doctrine.</note> desire the glory of Gods sonnes, the sonnes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues ought much more feruently to desire it; because the glory of the creature doth but depend vpon the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Gods children, and is very farre inferiour vnto it. Therefore if their desire bee great and constant after it, ours ought a great deale more so to be, seeing that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry shall be fully reuealed chiefly for our sakes, and our state shall by many degrees exceed the estate of all other creatures.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>It is two-fold, both in respect of godly and the vngodly. In respect of the vngodly, it serueth most<note place="margin">Vse.</note> sharpely to reproue them as being worse then the dumb, sence-lesse, vnreasonable creatures, in that they haue no desire nor longing at all after the glory to come; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as euen the creature doth couet it feruently. The heart of the wicked it is set vpon riches, they trust in vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine goods, they mind earthly things, their portion and their treasure is heere; and therefore their ioy is heere, they doe not once looke after heauenly glory, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they professe, much lesse seriously: nay they doe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute the seruants of God which doe put their trust in God, and hope for his glory, 2. Tim. 1, 11, 12. also 2, 9, 10. Thus the loue of the world, and strength of sinfull corruption, hath quenched that desire and hope of the wicked concerning heauenly glory, which still liues in vnreasonable creatures: this is a miserable condition. Secondly, in respect of the godly, this must serue first to checke and reproue the weaknesse and coldnesse of their desires after celestiall glory, where of the very creature is so greedy. Secondly, to prouoke and whet themselues to a more eager thirst and longing after it by example of the creature, and in consideration that the same glory doth especially belong to them in a more speciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and measure, and therefore ought in an especiall sort
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:20835:289"/>
to be coueted of them; for which purpose very great care must be had as for the mortification of al sinfull corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, so chiefly for the crucifying of the world to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; because heauen is more or lesse desired, as world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things are more or lesse beloued of vs.</p>

                     <p>That is declared in the 20. verse to be the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that is, the vanishing and flceting condition of the creature, consisting in bondage and corruption.</p>

                     <p>That all the creatures of God which bee vnder the third heauen, bee liable to vanity, beeing at the first created of God in a most noble and excellent condition.

                     <p>Secondly, to humble man, in consideration that all the creatures are impaired and made the worse for his<note place="margin">A righteous man regards the life of his beast saith <hi>Saloman.</hi>

                     <p>Of the manner of deliuerance of the creatures there be two opinions. The first opinion is, that it shall bee by abolition or annihilation, making the creature cease to be at all; which is a kind of deliuerance, because if the creature be not at all, then it can no longer be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der vanity, bondage, and corruption. The second opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is, that this deliuerance shall bee by a chaunge of qualities, the creature being altered into a better estate; as a man is changed in his regeneration, his substance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines the same, a newe quality of holinesse is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

And this last opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do I hold to be the truest, and that for these reasons following. The first is, by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of Scripture, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:20835:290"/>
that the world shalbee but changed and renued. <hi>Psa.</hi> 102-26. 27. <hi>Esay</hi> 66, 22. and 65. 17. And in this last place as in our text also, there is promise made not of annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but of a restitution of the worlde, that it shall not vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly be extinct, but renued; as <hi>Peter</hi> expounds it 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 13. Secondly, as the world was but changed and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at the first by water, so it shall bee no otherwise at the last by fire; that was only changed, and not quite destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, so shall this be.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, our Text doth not barely say the creature shal be deliuered, but addeth, (into the glorious liberty of the sonnes of God) which plainely shewes that their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance is another thing then beeing brought to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, euen a communicating with the sonnes of God, in one part of their glory, (to wit;) in incorruption and immortality, which the creature had by Creation and by naturall instinct still desires to recouer it, as verse, 22. Fourthly, euery creature desireth it owne preseruation naturally and abhorreth destruction; therefore it is not a bringing to nothing, (this deliuerance;) for the creature woulde neuer desire that, that is against nature. Fistly, <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> third verse 22. speaketh of restoring, not of men onely but of all other things. Lastly, the same Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Peter,</hi> exhorts vs to liue without blame, because there should be new heauens and new earth: all this doth argue and strongly prooue, that this deliuerance of the creature, shall not be by a reduction into nothing, but by an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into a better estate. The restitution of the creature shall be like the resurrection from the dead: but what shal be the particular properties, workes, and vses of all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery creature after the last iudgement; let no man enquire, because it is not reuealed in the worde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="590" facs="tcp:20835:291"/>
Secondly, it warneth the godly not to be troubled with the confusions and disorders of the world, because one day God will bring all these thinges into better frame. Thirdly, it must call our hearts from the imoderate loue of money and other riches, because these being no part of the world, must be consumed &amp; burnt vp by the fire: &amp; therefore it is a folly to loue them too much. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it should stirre all men to endeuour earnestly newnes of life; because if the creature cannot enioy glory vntil it be first cleansed and changed, then much lesse we, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we be purged and purified from our spots of sinne, by continuall repentance.</p>

                     <p>This: that the creature is vnder great misery, vntil the time of restoring commeth.

The second is, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, in that many liuing creatures perish for vs day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and such as are without life, shall bee dissolued and changed. The reason heereof is; first Gods decree, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> it to be so, as the euent hath declared; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing fals out in time, which was not decreed before all times. The second reason heereof is, Mans sin, for whose sake and vse, as God created the world at first in perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, so when he being Lord of the creature transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, the world was impaired and subdued to corruption, through his disobedience.

                     <p>That the redemption of the saithfull will then bee effectuall and compleat, when their bodies shall be againe raised out of the dust.

The reason which is here vsed to prooue this, is taken from the nature of hope, thus: We haue heauenly saluation no otherwise but by hope, therefore our full saluation is yet absent from vs, and with patience to bee waited for. For where the thing hoped for is present, there is no place for hope, which
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:20835:294"/>

Secondly, this admonisheth howe to make triall of our Faith, euen by that hope which we haue of saluation to come: for these two are inseparable, none can certainly expect saluation except they do beleeue it to be truly promised: and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer can vndoubtedly looke for heauenly glorie by Hope, it is because first by faith they haue receiued the promise of it. Thirdly it teacheth, that the faithfull by infallible certainty, may assure their hearts of their own eternal saluation, because they are saued by hope, which doth not make ashamed or confoundeth, which it should do, if the hope of glory might be frustrate.</p>

                     <p>No, it is not; but assurance ariseth from the quality of the thinges which bee absent and hoped for, which if they haue causes contingent, then the Hope is doubtfull and vncertaine: but if they bee of necessarie causes, then the hope is vndoubted and firme.

Secondly, from hence wee may see,<note place="margin">Ospes fallaces, meritis conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re nostris.</note> that true beleeuers haue reason to reioyce, insomuch as though their perfect felicity be absent, yet they are most sure in the end to haue it.

                     <p>A two-fold neede: First, because their hope is<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> deferred, therefore Christians must haue patience; for it is no small triall and temptation to bee long kept from that which one doth earnestly and truly loue, beeing of such inestimable worth. Secondly, because the faithfull are heere subiect to many and manifold miseries, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they must possesse their soules in patience, it being the will of God to afflict them diuersly and deepely, and not onely to holde their inheritaunce from them for a while: and therefore they haue neede of patience, that hauing done the wil of God, they may be glorified. This may be set set forth by the example of Merchants, Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Labourers, who are all of comfort, because they do looke verie surely to obtaine a good end of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; yet in the meane time they make account to meet withall, and to resist diuers difficulties in their voyages, warres, and affaires.</p>

                     <p>These three things; first, our sinfull weaknesse, to wit, ignorance, distrust, &amp;c. for these he as a proper cause

to make vs weake, <hi>Mat.</hi>26. 41. <hi>the flesh is weake.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, afflictions &amp; crosses inward and outward, because these serue to declare our weaknes as trials of it. Thirdly, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation and vexation of spirit, arising through the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of crosses and tribulations; whence it is that euen the faithfull themselues are voyde of counsell oftentimes, and know not which way to turne them: as it sared with <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saphat,</hi> when three nations banded against him, and with <hi>Elishaes</hi> seruant when he saw the <hi>Aramites host.</hi>

                     <p>It would be better translated [<hi>helpeth togither</hi>] for it is a speech borrowed from two or more persons, which being to take or lift vp some heauy burthen, doe mutually one helpe another, by standing one ouer against another, each at one end of the burthen: others take it to be a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor taken from sicke persons, or infants, or olde rotten houses, which cannot sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d vnlesse they be propped vp. The meaning of the Apostle is, that the faithfull are many times so faint vnder the burthen of the crosse, as that they would languish if the holy Spirite of God did not support them mightily by an especiall ayd and presence, as it were stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ouer against them, to beare the burthen with them that they sinke not.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>What doctrines will arise from the words thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <p>Two, the first doctrine is, that all men (none exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, no not the Apostles themselues) are subiect to al man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of infirmities in this life, outward and inward, as appea reth in this, that the Apostle sayth [our infirmities] putting himselfe in the number of those who are liable to weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses. It appeareth also by the testimony of scripture, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing, that in many things we sinne all, <hi>Iames</hi> 3. 2. 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8. 46. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 7. These places proue sinfull infirmities to be common to all; and where it is written that wee are to enter into the kingdome of heauen through many tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 22. and that hee that will liue godly must suffer afflictions, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 12. these places proue also that
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:20835:297"/>
other infirmities which bee but effects and consequences of sinnesull infirmities, are likewise common to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. It appeareth also by reason grounded vppon holy scripture; for since our sanctification is imperfect, and our life a warfare, and Sathan and the worlde haue leaue giuen them to tempt; therefore it cannot be but that all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers must beeliable to infirmities of all sorts, so long as they liue here.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>But how then is it written that Christ hath healed all our infirmities. Mat. 8. 17. Esay 53. 4. 5.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Christ hath taken and healed our infirmities of sinne, by remoouing from vs the guilt and curse, but not the corruption: and of afflictions, by sanctifying them vnto vs, that they may not bee punishments, but tryalles and exercises vnto vs. Secondly, in the end, at the day of the resurrection, wee shall bee wholly and fully freed from all infirmities both sinnes and teares; in the meane space they are left remaining in the Saintes, for excellent good purposes and vses.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Tell vs then what vse we are to make of our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and of the doctrine concerning them?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>It is no small comfort to Gods children being vnder infirmities of all sorts, that none are exempted. If Christ would haue his Apostles bee comforted with this, that so the Prophets were persecuted. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 11. 12., then let euery Christian that hath any affliction, labour to make this his comfort, that others are so dealt withall: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 9. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by the knowledge and sence of these infirmities, the prayers of Gods children are much whetted and quick ned, also their faith and patience much tryed, as golde is tryed in the furnace, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 1. 7. 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12. 8. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they serue greatly to humble the faithfull, and to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the vaine pride of their hearts, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. least af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the example of <hi>Peter</hi> forgetting his infirmities, they do fall into security, by presuming too much on their owne strength. And very certain it is, that whensoeuer the crosse comes, they are likest to stand to it, that best knowe and
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:20835:297"/>
feele their owne infirmities; because such will not relye vpon themselues but on the power of God. The story of Maister Sanders and Doctor Pendleton doth serue to declare the truth of this.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Thus farre of the first doctrine, what is the next?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>This: That the crosse or afflictions for Christs sake are like a burthen which cannot be borne but with much strength.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>But the Crosse is Christs burthen, and hee saith that his burthen is light, Mat 11, 30.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Our Sauiour in that text meaneth the burthen of his doctrine and commandements, which indeede are not burthensome to beleeuers in this life, 1. Iohn, 5. 3. He speakes not of the Crosse and tribulations, which is so heauy, as of our selues wee are not able to take it vp, much lesse to beare it, except the Holy-Ghost (like vnto <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Ciren</hi>) lay his shoulders vnder it, and helpe to beare it with vs.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Tea, but the Apostle Paul cals our afflictions light, 2. Cor. 4, 17.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Paul</hi> there speakes comparatiuely, in comparison of that waighty glory which followes afflictions. See Rom. 8, 18. But afflictions considered simply and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely as they are in themselues, they are greeuous and a burthen too heauy for vs to beare. For <hi>Ezekiah</hi> vnder the burthen of his afflictions mourned, <hi>Dauid</hi> fainted, <hi>Iob</hi> cursed the day of his birth, &amp; <hi>Peter</hi> for feare of the crosse denied his Lord. If the Crosse made such Champions to stoope, how should we not feare such a burthen? especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when it shall come to the fiery triall, and Christians must be put to fight against sinne to bloud.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>What profit is to be made of this Doctrine?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, to admonish Christians that it standeth them vpon, well to prepare themselues against the time of the Crosse, it being a thing so burthensome. It was good counsell which <hi>Salomon</hi> gaue, <hi>My sonne</hi> (faith hee) <hi>prepare thy souls against the day of afflictions.</hi> And againe, <hi>In
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:20835:298"/>
thy prosperity thinke vppon the time of aduersity, Ecclesiastes</hi> 7, verse 16.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, seeing affliction is so heauy, let men be well aduised, that where no cause is they cast not themselues into troubles, 1. Pet. 1, 6. For this is great rashnesse, and will breede no comfort, but late repentance. Thirdly, if the Crosse of afflictions bee sent vpon you by God, yet despaire not though it bee heauy, suspecting your owne strength, but flye vnto the holy Spirite of God for ayde and strength: as men vnder waighty burthens crye for helpe, so must the children of God doe, the more heauy they feele the burthen of afflictions, the more earnestly they must call to God for helpe.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>But how can Gods children be sure that the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of God can helpe them?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>He will, because it is the office of the Spirite to helpe our infirmities, as it is said in this Text: also he can<note place="margin">I will be with thee saith god to <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 3. God and <hi>Moses</hi> will be stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g enough euen against <hi>Pharaoh.</hi>
                        </note> well helpe them, because beeing the mighty God, hee is stronger then all that is against vs; for if God bee on our side, who can be against vs? Rom. 8, 31. How weake so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer man be of himselfe, yet he cannot be but strong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, so long as he hath God with him: and therefore we are to looke to our owne weakenesse and vnablenesse to beare, that we may be humbled, but not discouraged: also to fasten the eye of our minde vpon the strength and might of the Holy-Ghost, considering not what we in our selues can suffer, but what he is able to make vs to suffer, 2. Cor. 12, 12. Psal. 121, 2.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Now shew vs what this word [Likewise] must admonish vs of?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It doth admonish vs of the abundant and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold comforts prouided for the faithfull, and before propounded, to encourage them to beare the crosse pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieutly. For first, it is an honest thing so to doe, because we suffer with Iesus Christ. Secondly, it is verie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for vs so to do, because if wee suffer with Christ, we shall be glorified with him. Thirdly, our afflictions
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:20835:298"/>
are farre vnequall to that glory which in heauen we shal enioy. Fourthly, the creature giues vs an example of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, for they grone. Fistly, we haue the stay of hope certainly looking for eternal blisse, and of patience qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly to waite and expect it till it come: and if all these be not enough to encourage vs, we haue (likewise) the secret helpe of the Spirit in our hearts. Thus hath God in this Scripture, prouided a rich storehouse of comforts for the faithful, that as afflictions abound, so might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations abound also. As a man in war, hauing his Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer full of Arrowes, if he take vp but one, it may serue to preserue himselfe and auoide his enemy: so one of these comforts laide hold of, will be enough to stay a soule in aduersity, much more being ioyntly and altogether laid hold vpon.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Now proceede to the latter part of this verse (for wee know not how to pray as we ought, but the Spirit it selfe makes requests for vs, with sighes that cannot be expressed,) and tell vs what is the sum of it.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Thus much: when the Saints in great temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons through ignorance and weaknesse, know not what is good for them to aske, then the holy Spirit stirreth vp sighes secretly, and causeth them to pray with groanes, which cannot be vttered.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>But is this ignorance common to all beleeuers, that in some case they know not what to aske?</p>

                     <p>It is so: as appeareth in this, that <hi>Paul</hi> numbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himselfe among those which laboured vnder this ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance: the which he doth not falsely of counterfeite modesty, or for conclusion sake onely, but in very truth and as the thing was, as Rom. 1, 10. Hee prayed often<note place="margin">The Godly faile in their prayers, for lack of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> that he might go to Rome, but God heard him not: also he was not heard when he prayed, that the pricke in his flesh might be taken away, 2 Cor. 12, 7. Also <hi>Moyses</hi> prayed to enter into <hi>Canaan</hi> and did not. <hi>Ieremy</hi> prayed for the health of the people, but God did not heare him. <hi>Abrahum</hi> prayed in vaine for the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> and <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi>

for <hi>Saul,</hi> and the widdow <hi>Zebedee</hi> for her two sonnes, of whom Christ saide, <hi>She knew not what shee asked.</hi> This then is the reason why God denieth the prayers of his Children many times, euen because that they which ask it is either hurtfull, or not profitable for them, or else they aske it out of time: but when God heareth not his Saints after their will, he heareth them to their benefite giuing them something better for them then that which they ask, as in <hi>Pauls</hi> case, 2 Cor. 2. 10, 11. Also somtimes God doth fulfill mens Prayers in his wrath and displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to their owne hurt, as it happened to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> asking flesh in the Desart, Exod. 16, 13. Numb. 11, 33. and crauing a King in the land of Canaan, 1 Sam. 8, 5.</p>

                     <p>That both the godly and the wicked, are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ignorant of what they aske.

Also they iudge sundry things euill, which either be not euill (simply) or not euil to them.</p>

                     <p>By stirring vp requests in vs, and causing vs to pray. That this is the meaning of the words, apeareth by comparing this Text with the 15. verse of this chapter, where it is written. We haue receiued the Spirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby we cry <hi>Abba</hi> Father; the Spirit crieth by making vs cry. Thus vnderstand that in <hi>Gal.</hi> 4, 6.</p>

                     <p>Thus much: that when the Scripture saith, the Spirit crieth and maketh request, the meaning is, that it maketh vs to cry and to make request; and this is an vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all thing, to attribute vnto God those things which the godly do by diuine inspiration. Thus God is sayde to know, by teaching others, and illuminating their minds that they may know, as <hi>Augustine</hi> obserues out of those words, in Gen. 18, 19. <hi>I know thou fearest me,</hi> and in the Galathians 4, 9. Forasmuch, as ye know God, or rather are knowne of God, that is, taught that yee may know. So <hi>Deut.</hi> 8, 2. God is saide to tempt the Hebrewes, that<note place="margin">Facit nos postu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lare quae Dco placet.</note> he may know what is in them, that is, make themselues and others to know what is in them: so heere the Spirit maketh request, that is, moueth vs to request.</p>

                     <p>That the prayers of the godly come from Gods Spirite. The text is plaine heerein, to which may be ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that which is written, 1. Cor. 12, 3.

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, that no Turke, nor Iew, nor Idolator, nor Hereticke can pray, because they haue not the Spirite Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that no wicked man nor hypocrite can pray, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they receiue not the Spirite. Thirdly, that in our best prayers, we ought to be humbled, seeing they are not our owne, but come from the Spirite, which is our prompter, moderater, and Schoole-maister. Fourthly, that in begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of prayer, we craue of God, the assistance of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite.</p>

                     <p>This is meant eyther intensiuely for such sighes as<note place="margin">Quiasunt de re incnarrabil's, sci. vita aeterna.</note> are most feruent, no man beeing able to vtter them, for their greatnesse and exceeding vehemency, or properly for such sighes as wee cannot vtter by any speech, because of their weakenesse and feeblenesse. The godly in whom they<note place="margin">Facit gemere plus quam dici potest.</note> be, know not of them, through the infirmity of the flesh, and strength of temptations, they are not aware nor doe know that they doe pray much lesse speake any thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressedly in prayer; yet they are grones and sighes wrought in them by the holy Spirite, which though the beleeuers feele them not, yet God seeth and heareth them, for they make a loude cry in his eare, as in Exod. 14, 15. This is the fitter sence, therefore the better, because it suteth with scope and matter, the phrase also will beare it.</p>

                     <p>That the sighes of the heart albeit neuer a word be spoken, be prayers, euen as a desire to beleeue and to repent in a truely humbled heart, be accepted for faith and repentance with God, who will not breake the brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed reede, and accepts the will for the worke: so the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to call vpon God is prayer in his sight, God will ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill the desires of them that feare him, Psal. 145, 19.

                     <p>It affoards a singular comfort to the godly, in their afflictions, for that Gods Spirite workes wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their hearts to list them to Godward, euen aboue that that themselues can perceiue in minde, or bee able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in words. Secondly, it serues for to strengthen the weake against a temptation that they cannot pray, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they are to consider that if they do but sighe, it is a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er before God, a desire is a prayer, a continuall desire is a continuall prayer. Thirdly, it repoues hypocrites whoe imagine that they can pray well when they speake many wordes, and yet haue their hearts within voyde of secret sighes and grones which doe accompany true prayer.</p>

                     <p>Euen this, that God taketh pleasure in the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest prayers of his Saints; for he knoweth them, as that he heareth them, and in fauour granteth them: the reason is, because they come from the spirite, the meaning whereof God knoweth and embraceth, as a man doeth whatsoeuer

comes from himselfe. For as a mother knoweth the cry of her owne Infant though shee seeth it not, and though an hundred other children cry; and liketh it better than the cloquen t oration and learned speech of some other, who is but a stranger to her: so God is better pleased with the feeble requests of beleeuers, then with the pompous and long petitions of hypocrites.</p>

This trueth may be set forth by the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a comedy, of which the spectators knowe that the<note place="margin">Similitude.</note> end will be ioyful, though the beginning be troublesome; and such is the estate of true Christians.

Thus our Apostle setteth downe things first more manifest, and afterward thinges more secret: First the effects, and then the causes.

                     <p>First, it stirreth vs vp to seeke for the loue of God, and for the encrease of it in our hearts, seeing we cannot be patient without it.

                     <p>This: none but Gods children can be patient in afflictions, because none can loue God saue his owne children: therfore they haue but the shadow of patience, and be blockish and sencelesse rather then patient.</p>

The reason heereof is, because God hauing once purposed to saue men, it cannot be but that they must haue all good things which belong to their saluation. For God hath purposed the meanes as well as the ende, and will cause euery thing to serue for their good, whom he hath loued from euerlasting.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, that the purpose of God for our saluation is manifested in our calling, which is the first fruite of our election, Rom. 8, 29. Secondly, it serues to distinguish an outward calling by the Gospell, from an inward ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall calling, which leades to Christ: for all which be called by the Gospell are not called of Gods purpose. Thirdly, to teach that all be not called nor do loue God, but elect ones onely, and that after the time of their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall calling.</p>

                     <p>That such as are the better by their afflictions, more humbled, and made more obedient, haue a good witnesse that they loue God, and are the called and elect of God; because none but these can profit by afflictions, vnto sound obedience of the word.

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and patience in afflictions, taken from the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity which they bring, which was this: that afflictions shall turne to the saluation of such as loue God and are called according to his purpose. This the Apostle proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth by two reasons: the former is taken from the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Gods purpose, which is the fore-knowledge of God, predestinating some to be made like vnto his Sonne Christ.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>By reasoning in this manner: Whosoeuer be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of the purpose of God, are fore-knowne and predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to bee like vnto Christ. But Christ hauing suffered asslictions, was afterward glorified. Therefore such as God bath called of his purpose, must suffer with Christ, that they may be glorified with him: for being conformed to Christ in temporary afflictions, they must be conformed to him also in eternall glory.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It is by an vnchangeable connexion, or knitting of causes and effects together, after this sort. Whom God<note place="margin">They which be predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, doe not perish, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Gods predestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueable.</note> purposeth to saue, them he foreknew; whom he foreknew, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath predestinated; who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hath predestinated, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he calleth; whom he calleth, them he iustifieth; whom hee iustifieth, them he sanctifieth; whom he sanctifieth, them he glorifieth.

present and to come; this is by Diuines, called (Gods prescience) or the knowledge of his prescience, whereof we reade, Acts, 2, 23. Secondly, there is a knowledge in God of fauour, whereby he knoweth some before hand as his owne, with whom he was well pleased from euerlasting. This is by Diuines called the knowledge of his loue, or approbation, and it is the same which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle calleth his good pleasure, Ephe. 1, 6. In this sence<note place="margin">It is not a prescience of merites and truth, which is the cause of election.</note> the word is vsed, Rom. 11, 2. as also in this our text, Whom he foreknew, that is, they whom he loued and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from euerlasting, out of the lost lumpe of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde. As the loue which God exerciseth towardes the faithfull, is in Scripture called his knowledge, Psal. 1, 6. So the decree of his loue from euerlasting, is tearmed fore-knowledge.</p>

euen when wee were enemies, hee will nowe much more loue and saue vs, seeing wee are reconciled by his Sonne through faith in his bloud.</p>

                     <p>To predestinate, is to decree any thing before hand, and bring it vnto a certaine end through certain and appointed meanes: If this predestination (saith <hi>Augustine</hi>) can be deceiued, then may God be ouercome of mans sin, which cannot be.</p>

                     <p>That predestination is ioyned vnto foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge as subordinate to it. Gods foreknowledge is no bare and idle thing, but is euer coupled with his decree and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance; whatsoeuer God knoweth or seeth before, hee ordaineth to some speciall end, and vnto that end hee shall at last bring it; this is it which is here called predestination.</p>

The very worde (predestinate) is taken foure times in Scripture in this sence, as Rom. 8, 29, 30. Ephe. 1, 5, 11. But yet the matter and doctrine it selfe is handled in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many places, as Rom. 9, and 11. Ephe. 1. Mat. 11, 25. Iohn, 6. and 17, 6. Acts, 13, 48. 1. Thes. 5. 1. Pet. 1, 2.

                     <p>No verily, for it ought to be taught to Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Gods Ministers should sinne if they passed by it.

For as the Apostles were followers of Christ in doctrine and life, so ought other Ministers. Secondly, it is a part of Gods reuealed will, and therfore belongs vnto vs, Deut. 29, 29. Thirdly, it is a speciall ground-worke of comfort and patience vnder the Crosse to knowe our predestination to bee so vnchangeable, strong and firme, as our Apostle doth heere aduertise vs <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

                        <pb n="626" facs="tcp:20835:309"/>Fourthly, it is the Mother of all godlinesse, to which a man or woman doth then (and neuer before) seriously and chearfully apply themselues, when they vnderstand by Faith Gods eternall loue towards them in their free predestinating to life, 1 Iohn 4, 10. <hi>We loue him, because he loued vs first.</hi> Lastly, it begetteth true and ioyfull thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, which we will not offer vnto God, except wee know that all good comes of his eternall purpose, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any respect to our worthinesse.</p>

                     <p>But the conceite of Predestination, and that the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinate persons must be saued, dooth take away from men all care of Faith, Ministery, Prayer and Good workes, vse of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>This is a verie slanderous vntrueth, because the Doctrine of Predestination doth necessarily put &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend vnto vs all these meanes; so farre off it is from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying them, or extinguishing the care &amp; vse of them: because it is taught, that whome God predestinateth, them he calleth, iustifieth, and glorifieth. Thus vnlikely it is, that Predestination should exclude Christ, the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, Faith, Calling, Iustification, Holinesse of life, as it doth include and inferre all these necessarily. The reason heereof is, because it is wholesomly taught &amp; beleeued, according to Scripture, that God predestinating vnto the end, hath also fore-ordained to the meanes which bring vs vnto such an end, and that immutably and most freely. And therefore it is a grosse error to say this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine breedeth either desperation or licentiousnes.</p>

For if God doe call all those in time whom he ordained to life before all times, then such as be called, may thereby know they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated,
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:20835:309"/>
as the cause is knowne by the effect, the roote by the fruit, the fountain by the riuer, so Gods eternal loue by calling.</p>

                     <p>It is true, there is an outward calling by the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell onely, which wants the inward grace of the Spirite, to make it effectuall; this is common to many reprobates, and is no sure token of election, because it brings no further then to the bare knowledge and profession of Christ, and to some generall and sleight reformation, such as an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite may haue; but not to Christ himselfe by faith in the gospel. But the calling which is both a fruite, and a certain note of predestination, is such a calling, which together with the outward preaching of the word, hath the inward working of the holy Spirite to be get faith in the Gospell; whereby a man is carried to Christ himselfe to be planted in him, and ioyned to him as a true member, and to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by his spirit, working in vs obedience to our caller: of this calling our text speakes.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>First, how needfull a thing it is for vs to haue the gospell and the preaching thereof, seeing persons of yeares are not ordinarily called vnto the faith of Christ without it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. Secondly, that no Christian must rest in an outward generall calling and knowledge (though it be a great mercy) but striue and labour after that especiall and effectuall calling, which is euer coupled with faith and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the Gospell. Thirdly, such as haue this cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, haue exceeding cause to reioyce and be glad, and to bee thankfull to God; because they haue receiued an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted pledge of Gods loue and their owne saluation, in such sort as they may glory in God, yea euen in tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

                     <p>Yea, all predestinate Infants (and such wee are to take all the infants of Christian Parents to be, for that they belong to the Couenant, and we know nothing to the contrary,) they haue an inward calling by the Spirit, though not after the same manner, as persons of discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and yeares. For the Apostle heere speakes of the meanes, how all the elect are brought to blessednesse: therefore seeing infants are predestinate, as no doubt many be, they must of necessity bee iustified and haue a Calling. For whom hee predestinateth, them he calleth, &amp;c. it is some vnvtterable and vnconceiueable worke of the holy Ghost, drawing them to Christ, either by Faith or Analogie.</p>

                     <p>It is our Iustification or being iustified, which signifies to be absolued from the guilt and punishment of all our sinnes, and to be accounted iust by imputation of Christes obedience through Faith, Acts 13, 48. Rom. 4, 4, 5, 6.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>First, because there is nothing but faith alone, which goes betweene Calling and Iustifying. Secondly,
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:20835:310"/>
Scriptures doe fully teach that our Iustification is by Faith: but yet Faith is not the cause why we are iustified no more than workes. It is onely the Instrument to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend Christs Iustice: the true &amp; proper causes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">How faith do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth iustisie, &amp; not iustify. <hi>See</hi> 3.

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That wee are freely iustified by Faith without workes: the reason heere of is, because we are iustified at the very instant of our calling, at what time wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, before we haue done any good worke at all: also because elect Infants which can do neuer a good worke, are both called and iustified, as infants elect, which dye in their infancy.</p>

                     <p>It confutes the Papists, which ascribe iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to good workes, which are fruites following iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, therefore they cannot bee causes going before our iustification. Secondly, it conuicteth them of error, which would haue any persons in time iustified before they beleeue. Lastly, it commends vnto vs the necessitie and excellency of Faith, without the which wee cannot be partakers of Christ, nor haue our sinnes pardoned by his death, nor be accounted iust before God, nor be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God, nor haue peace in our selues.</p>

                     <p>That neuer any person shall bee crowned with glory in heauen, which is not first sanctified by grace on earth, enabled by the Spirite to leade a iust and holy life, which is both the entrance and the right way vnto celesti all glory.</p>

Secondly, it giues great encouragement to all godly persons, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede and encrease in holinesse, seeing their sanctification is sure to end in glorification, euen in eternall blessednesse: and that is the reason why the Apostle writeth in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terperfect te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce rather than in the present tence, to note the certainty of it; which causeth <hi>Paul</hi> to write as if it were already done; He hath called, he hath iustified, he hath glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas</speaker>
                     <p>First, what the holy Catholike Church is; to wit, a company of men gathered together, not by fortune, or humane reason and policy, or any worthines of their own; but by the meere mercy and goodnesse of God, sorekno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, louing, predestinating, and calling them, that he may iustifie and glorifie them through his Sonne Christ. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that predestination is not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon to all, because all<note place="margin">Election not vniuersall.</note> be not called nor iustified; and therefore we further learn that all shall not be saued. Thirdly, that the elect cannot fall from grace and glory, because Gods purpose in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them through all the meanes to glory, is immutable and infallible. Fourthly, that predestination is most free,<note place="margin">Predestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on free.</note> and not depending vpon foreseene workes and faith: but vpon Gods eternall foreknowledge and loue, vpon which faith and good workes doe depend. Lastly, that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds either from ignorance or malice, to say, that men pre destinated may liue as they list, or that they neede not care

                     <p>By these words our mindes are carried backe to the matter formerly set downe; namely, in the 30. verse, as that there is no condemnation to faithfull ones, which be in Christ, that they haue the Spirite of adoption, are sonnes, heires, fellow-heires: but chiefely that out of Gods most free and eternall fore-knowledge and loue they were chosen and predestinated, and had that euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting good will of God made knowne vnto them, in their effectual calling to faith, in their iustifying by faith, in sanctification begun, and in the hope of glorification to come.

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Two things: First, a secret temptation, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, a meanes how to ouercome it. The secret temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:20835:312"/>
is this, that all creatures are bent against true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers, which be Christs members: and indeed it is so, for not onely sinne, Sathan, the world, Diuels, Tyrants, persecutors, heretickes, Idolatours, but euen of the same profession; as brethren, yea Parents, acquaintance, kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes, wiues, husbands, brethren, Sisters, Children, they of their owne house are enemies, and such as eate bread with them, lift vp their heele against them. So it was with <hi>Dauid,</hi> and with Christ, and with the Apostles, and so must others looke to haue it; which made <hi>Chryse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi> by an Apostrophe with a question, to rise vp against <hi>Palus</hi> question; saying, O <hi>Paul,</hi> why askest thou who wil be against vs? now if God bee on our side, who will not be against vs? for we are hated of all for his sake: this is a heauy triall. The meanes to auoid this temptation, is by this perswasion, that God is with vs. Now God is with vs two wayes, eyther by his generall power to vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold vs, as a common preseruer of all; or by his speciall care and prouidence, as a propitious father &amp; protector: thus it is meant heere. For he saith (with vs) that is, vs whom he foreknew, whom hee predestinated. Hence <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> hath this sweet meditation, worth our marking: When wee were not, God predestinated vs; when wee run from him and turned our selues backewards, hee called vs to him: when wee were vnrighteous, then hee iustified vs: when wee were impure, he sanctified vs; and after a short time spent in his obedience and seruice, he will glorifie vs. Now then, who so fighteth against Gods children, fighteth against God himselfe, their propitious Father, and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full protector.</p>

                     <p>What is our doctrine from hence?</p>

                     <p>This, the fatherly goodnes &amp; protection of God: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beleeued on, is a sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t refuge &amp; succour against the whole worlde of enemies and dangers: the reason here of
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:20835:313"/>
is, because the power of God is infinite, his almightinesse cannot bee resisted, whereas the power of all Creatures is finite and limited: and as God made them by his great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of nothing, so to nothing can hee bring them by the same power. I herefore the world is vanity, the Diuell is a bugge or fear-crow; men are as a bubble in comparison of the mighty God. Let this be spoken to distressed ones. The godly haue beene greatly comforted with this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Gods being with them; as the godly Prophet <hi>Dauid, Psal.</hi> 3. 5. and 27. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. 6. and <hi>Psal.</hi> 23. 4. 5. For as the wicked and vnbeleeuers be vnhappy (though al the world be with them) because God is against them: so the faithfull bee happy, because God alone fauours them, though the whole world be against them. Because hee cannot onely preserue them that nothing hurt their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation: but can cause euery thing to worke for them, and to further their saluation.</p>

                     <p>It reproues such as doe so leane vnto their wealth and friends, as that they make no account of Gods helpe: Such was <hi>Saul</hi> and his courtiers, <hi>Psalm.</hi> 4. 4. such was <hi>Toeg, Psal.</hi> 51. 7. such were the wicked <hi>Israelites</hi> in <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> time, which made the arme of flesh their strength, and leaned vpon the broken reede of Egypt: and such are<note place="margin">1, Tim. 6. 17.</note> all vsurers and couetous persons, whose affiance is not in the liuing God, but in their vncertaine riches, whatsoeuer they say or professe: &amp; therefore in the day of the Lords wrath they shalbe as a broken hedge and as a tottering wall, as waxe before the Sunne, so shall they melt away. For as God will saue all that trust in him, so hee will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy all that doe not. Secondly, heere is a double ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation vnto all faithfull godly Christians: as first that they be of a valiant and vndanted courage, euen when they want all meanes of helpe, because Gods protection is sufficient for them; after the example of <hi>Moses</hi> in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gipt, <hi>Dauid</hi> amongst the Philistims, and <hi>Daniel</hi> in Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.

yet then to make God their onely stay, not leaning v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon second causes, which are as a deceitfull broken bowe, &amp; which cannot do vs any stead, except God blesse them: and here is the trial of a man that truely trusts in God, that as he is not too much cast downe at the absence of means, so hee is not too much lifted vp at the presence of them. Thirdly, this doctrine teacheth that how miserable soeuer godly men bee in the eye of the worlde, yet they are most blessed, because they haue euer more with them, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them; God being more able to do them good, then Diuels or men are to doe them hurt.</p>

                     <p>We are taught how to iudge when God is with vs; to witte, not by his patience, or outward benefits, or worldly deliuerances; for these be common to all sorts of men: but by the effects and fruites of our predestination to life; as our calling, faith, iustifying, sanctifying, dying to sinne, liuing to righteousnesse; by our loue to God and our brethren, and by our hope of glory. If we finde these things in vs, then God is with vs; because these are proper to his elect ones. This serues to discouer hypocrites, and to call the saithfull to a tryall and examination of themselues, whether they haue these things or no: as they may praise God for the graces they shall finde in themselucs, and pray more feruently for supply of all their spirituall wants.</p>

                     <p>It confuteth the opinion of merite by workes, for if Christ bee not the soueraigne and first cause of our saluation (but Gods loue is aboue it) then much lesse are our workes the cause of eternall life. Secondly, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the exceeding loue of God, that hee being so great would respect vs so little: which should moue vs to loue and reuerence him againe, and to expresse it by our sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and entire obedience to his word, and by suffering for him.</p>

                     <p>It teacheth (against the <hi>Arrians</hi>) that Christ is God coessentiall to his Father, Iohn 5, 18. Secondly, it distinguisheth Christ the naturall Sonne, from adopted ones, which are not his proper or owne sons, but by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation and grace. Thirdly, it highly extolles the loue of God, which hereby appeares to be very great, by the greatnesse of the thing giuen: If <hi>Abraham</hi> shewed how he esteemed of God, in that he offered to haue giuen his Son <hi>Isaac,</hi> how dooth God declare his loue to vs, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his owne Son for vs?</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, this serues to comfort Gods people in all their wants &amp; necessities whatsoeuer: for seeing God gaue vs his Sonne, it is not possible that he should keepe any thing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vs, which is good for vs. The reasons here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of bee very strong: First, because Christ is the greatest good thing, he is more worth then a thousand worldes, and he that giues the greatest good, wil not sticke at the lesser. Thus Christ reasons, Math. 6, 25. <hi>If he giue you life, he will much more feede you and cloath you.</hi> Secondly, Christ is the Fountaine of all other good thinges: it is for him and through him, that wee haue any thing else that is good; and al good things come from him, as riuers from
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:20835:315"/>
the spring, and beames from the Sun; therefore hauing him we can want nothing, and possessing him, wee pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse all things. The due meditation heereof, affoordes strong comfort, in time of any want or penury: it is not<note place="margin">

                     <p>That Christ, and the things of Christ cannot be diuided, but that he which hath the one, must haue the other; his person and benefits be inseparable. See Iohn<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3, 22, 23</note> 6, 40. These benefits they are either spiritual, as righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, sanctification, and redemption, 1 Cor. 1, 30. or earthly good things, so farre as they are behoouefull for his members: either they be supernal things, as God; or equall, as Angels; or inferiour, as the worlde; all is giuen with Christ.</p>

                     <p>It reproues two sorts of men: First Papists, who shut out the wicked from eternall life, and yet affirme, that they eate Christ in the Sacrament. Secondly, such as would haue vs partake in the benefits of Christ, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out partaking with himselfe: as if a branch could haue the iuice and life of the Vine, and not be in the Vine. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, it greatly comforts such as be married to Christ by faith: for hauing him, they are sure to haue al his things, euen as a woman maried to her husband, communicates in all his honour and wealth.</p>

                     <p>In these words: who shal lay ought to the charge of Gods chosen? to lay to ones charge, is a word taken from ciuill Courts, &amp; signifies to accuse, to cal one into law, to enter suite or action against him, charging him with some crime or guilt; and (by Gods chosen) is meant such as be elected of God, vnto life eternall, and doe beleeue the Gospell.</p>

                     <p>That all the merites of Christ, are appropriate vnto elect faithfull ones, for these he dyed, rose againe, sitteth at the right hand of God, and maketh request for them: those God iustifieth, sanctifieth, and glorifieth.

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>This: there be sundry aduersaries that will rise vp and accuse vs as guilty of sinne and death, how shall we doe? And indeed so it is: First, Sathan will charge vs Reuel 12, 10. Secondly, the lawe of <hi>Moses</hi> which wee haue transgressed, Iohn, 5, 45. Thirdly, our owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science will accuse vs, Rom. 2, 15. Lastly, the worlde will accuse vs, as it accused Christ, <hi>Iohn Buptist,</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and others. Now it is heauy to haue so many and subtle accusers in such a Court as before Gods tribunall, where the case concernes our saluation or damnation. Now the remedy which <hi>Paul</hi> doth giue vs against this temptation, is a very fit and excellent remedy, euen this: It is God who iustifieth. And note heere that iustification by absoluing, is opposed both vnto accusation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; from both an elect sinner is freed at his iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>What is meant by iustifying?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>To iustifie, signifies to absolue or acquit from guilt of sinne, and to account or pronounce one iust. That this is the meaning of the worde, may appeare first by comparing this place with Acts 13, 39. Where the worde iustified, can signifie no other thing then abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution from sinne. Secondly, because it is set against accusing &amp; condemning, which are two actions of iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the one charging a man with guilt and crime, the ther pronouncing punishment vpon him, beeing founde guilty and conuicted. Therefore iustification which is the contrary to both these, must needs signifie the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soluing and acquitting one from guilt and punishment, and the pronouncing of him iust; and this comes vnto vs by the obedience and death of Christ, being laid holde of by a liuely faith.</p>

the faithfull, because they haue God, who himselfe is the iudge to acquit them.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>They (whose sinnes God pardons and accepts for<note place="margin">A Maxime lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall.</note> iust men) neede not feare the accusation of all their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; the reasons hereof, be these. First, when contraries bee immediate, the putting or granting of the one, is the remouing of the other, as thus. The number is euen, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is not odde: <hi>Abraham</hi> is in heauen, therefore not in any part of hell. So here, God absolues, therefore it bootes<note place="margin">Who shall dis allow whome God allow eth: Gods iudgement seat is highest saith, <hi>

                        </note> none to accuse, for if they do, it is to no purpose. Second reason, God is the highest iudge, and his tribunall seate is the supreme iudgement seat; therefore from thence there is no appealing. As amongst men, persons accused or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, may appeale till they come to the highest Courtꝭ so being absolued before Gods tribunall seate, there is no further accusation to be feared; all appeales from thence, be void and of no force.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>It must serue to strengthen &amp; comfort vs, in the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of conscience, being frighted with the guilt of sinne, the sentence of the law, the cruelty of Sathan: in as much as these either dare not appeare before God, to accuse and charge vs, or if they doe it, it is but lost labour, since GOD the iudge hath discharged vs. Secondly, as it shewes the happines of iustified persons, so it bewrayes the great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery of such as doe not beleeue; because they bee subiect to the accusation of sin and Sathan themselues, and of the world, and to the condemnation of God and his law.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>So doe the beleeuers, because they haue sinne still in them, and Gods iustice must needs condemne sinne: how doth the Apostle answere this assault?</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>Thus, that Christ being dead, he hath in his death made satisfaction; and where satisfaction is made to diuine iustice, there is no cause to feare condemnation, which doth neuer proceede but against persons who cannot satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, neither by others nor themselues.</p>

                     <p>Exceeding great: for it quits them from all feare of condemnation by Gods Iustice, in respect of theyr sinnes; because where Christ becomes Patrone for to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend against the sentence of damnation, it is in vaine for sinne, Law, or Sathan, to attempt any thing against be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers.

                     <p>Two thinges: First, that the sinnes of the elect shall neuer come into examination or inquiry, being all for giuen and couered. Secondly, that Christ Iesus is a sufficient remedy against all things that may trouble or feare the conscience, and that these four maner of waies. First by his death, freeing vs from sinne and damnation. Secondly, by his rising againe, getting righteousnesse &amp; victory ouer all his enemies. Thirdly, by being at the right hand of God, he sheddeth downe the holy Ghost vpon vs with his sauing graces. Fourthly, by his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, he effectually applies vnto vs all his merites, and<note place="margin">For Christ to make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession, and to pray, is not to bee taken properly, but to shewe the good will of the Sonne to vs, as <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi> noteth.</note> continually preserues vs in the state of grace and salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Secondly, a confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the last calamity, to wit the sword, by testimonie of Scripture, verse 36. The answere containes a notable consolation from the contrary euent (to wit) the most wholesome yssue of calamities and crosses, wherein the beleeuers are not onely not ouercome, but do ouercom, yea do more then conquer. This euent is set forth by the cause, which is the vnchangeable loue and assistance of God through him that loued vs.</p>

That this is the meaning, may appear by the end of the 37. and 39. verses, which expound it of Gods loue to vs. Also it appeares by that which goes before our Text, for <hi>Paul</hi> had spoken of Christs loue to vs, witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by his dying for vs, rising againe, sitting at the right hand of God, and making request for vs; all which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his great loue toward the elect.</p>

                     <p>A good Lesson, which is this: the godlie must make reckoning to haue the perswasion of Gods loue as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted and sore shaken. The reason is, because it is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table aduantage to Satan, and hurt to Gods children, to doubt of Gods loue to them. For then Satan may bring in impatiency, despaire, dulhesse in Gods seruice, diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, loosenesse of manners, and all iniquity, which we are kept from by the sence of Gods loue, quickning our loue, and causing to hope in him wel &amp; constantly.</p>

This was <hi>Pauls</hi> perswasion for his part,

                     <p>First, by tribulation is meant euery thing which presseth or wringeth, to wit; any vexation. Secondly, by anguish, is meant streightnesse of place properly, but (by a Metaphor) preplexity of minde, when one knowes not what to doe; an example heereof, we haue in <hi>Ichosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,</hi> 2. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Fourthly by famine, is meant hunger, through wante of victuals to sustaine our life. Fiftly, nakednesse signifies want of apparell and cloathing to couer and defend our bodyes from cold. Sixtly by perill is meant dangerous distres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which put a man in perill and ieorpardy, such as <hi>Paul</hi> reckoneth, 2. Cor. 11, 25, 26. and Heb. 11, 36, 37. Lastly, by sword is meant slaughter, cruell tormenting, death, or punishment by barbarous sauage bloud-shed, as happened to <hi>Abell,</hi> the Prophets, and Christ, and holy Martyrs.</p>

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Apostle by reckoning vp the most bitter things, would teach vs, that seeing these things cannot put out the sence of Gods loue, neither any else in the world can doe it.

                     <p>By a text out of the psalme 44, verse, 22. <hi>For thy sake we are killed all the day long, we are counted as Sheepe for the slaughter.</hi> (All the day) may signifie all times of this life; or without intermission: or all the time of the world.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, that Christians are subiect euen to death and slaughter, as well as other calamities. Secondly, that<note place="margin">They are slaine with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance.</note> in this respect wee are like vnto Sheepe (not which are fedde for wooll or store) but such as are appointed for the kitching. Thirdly, they are put in mind to be meeke and patient in suffering of death, euen as sheepe are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Butchers hand. Fourthly, that death doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually hang ouer their heads, euen all day long, either for that they are ready euery day to dye if neede require, or because their continuall dangers are so many deaths as it were. Lastly, that the cause of the death of Gods Martyrs, is not any crime of their owne, but their sincere faith and profession of Christ, (<hi>for thy sake</hi>) as Math. 10. <hi>for my names sake,</hi> and Mat. 5.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Euen this, that in all these things they are more then Conquerors. The meaning heereof is, that true beleeuers in their miseries they doe not onely not fainte and are ouercome, but themselues get a glorious victory ouer their crosses and persecutions, both by their pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent wearying and vanquishing the persecutors, &amp; them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues brought to heauen.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Indeed this is a paradoxe, and strange to carnall reason, yet it is most true in this spiritual warfare, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer it be otherwise in the bodily warrefare. For the
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:20835:320"/>
Saints when they suffer and are killed, they are not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly patient, but reioyce and glory, which is the parte of victours, Rom. 5, 3. Secondly, because by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy they doe euen daunt the minds of their persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who rather seeme to bee ouercome, then the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs which suffer. Example heereof in the Pharisies, Acts, 4. and in <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostata, whose cruelty was conquered by the patience of the Martyrs. Lastly, of some of the Romaine persecutors, in the ten first perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, whose barbarous sauagenesse was euen tired with the stedfastnesse of the Saints in suffering. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Diuels practise is by crosses to wrest from Gods children their confidence in Gods loue, which is rather increased by this meanes, Rom. 5, 5, 6.</p>

                     <p>Not from themselues who are farre vnequall for so great a battaile, but from the helpe and aide of God confirming and establishing them. The cause that moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth God to affoord this strength, is his great loue which he beares them in Christ, (Through him that hath loued vs.)</p>

                     <p>That the victory which beleeuers doe get ouer all their troubles, depends not vpon their owne power or merites at all, but meerely, solely, and wholy in the loue that God beares them in Christ, see 1. Cor. 15. 57.</p>

                     <p>It warnes the Saints in their greatest patience &amp; constancy to be humbled, seeing they haue nothing but what they receiue from Gods loue. Secondly, it must stirre them vp to great thankfulnesse to God, so graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and mightily confirming them. Thirdly, it admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth weake Christians in the time of any calamity to flye to the throne of grace for succour, distrusting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues as <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> did. Lastly, it teacheth that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, can neuer fall from Gods loue. Of this before, 2.

                        <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh many things of himself, which are not peculiar to himselfe, but in common do belong to al Christians, as Gal. 2, 20. &amp; 6, 14. Phil. 1, 21. and often els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. Secondly, in the last words of this text, he wraps vp all other beleeuing Christians with himselfe, saying; <hi>Who shall separate vs.</hi> Thirdly, euery true beleeuer may be certainly assured of his own saluation, vpon the same grounds that <hi>Paul</hi> was of his: which grounds are eyther Theologicall and necessary, others are but Logicall and profitable only. The Theological and necessary grounds bee first, the foreknowledge and immutable purpose of Gods election, Rom. 8, 30. manifested in calling Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Sanctification.

                     <p>First, it conuicteth the Papists of errour, in that they teach that we haue but a probable and coniectural assurance of our election (to wit) by hope as they speak, to hope well of it; vnlesse it be some certaine men, who knew by reuelation Gods loue, as <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, Dauid, Paul, &amp;c.</hi> or of the predestinate in generall: but for any particular man to assure himselfe that God loues him, and that he is iustified and shall be saued, they esteem it presumption, and an illusion of the diuel. Their reasons be, First because none can be certaine of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuerance in grace, contrary to Rom. 8, 29, 30. Secondly,<note place="margin">Duplex persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio: vna fidei, altera charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis: haec aliqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do sallitur, illa nunquam. Lutherus.</note> because they finde the word heere Englished [<hi>Perswaded</hi>] to be elsewhere in Scripture applyed vnto coniecturall knowledge, as 1 Thess. 1, 4. Rom. 15, 14. 2 Tim. 1, 5. Heb. 6, 9. The cause whereof is, because in these places the Apostle speaketh not of his own, but of the faith &amp; ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of others, wherof we can haue but a charitable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion. The second vse of this doctrine, is to prouoke all that finde not this certaine perswasion of Gods loue, to labor for it, and those which haue it, to be exceeding thankfull to God for it.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, this reproues those that build their perswasion of Gods loue and their title to eternall life, on grounds which be probable onely, as because they are baptized, and haue knowledge and make protestation, and come to Sermons and Sacraments, and do some good things, and refraine from some euil things, and haue bin manie waies blessed and holpen of God; for al these things are common both to good and bad which liue in the bosom of the Church. See Eccl. 9. 2. 1 Cor. 10, 1, 2, 3, 4. Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites may haue, and many haue them all in a farre grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter plenty and proportion, then very many of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren haue them.</p>

                     <p>Of this, diuers men iudge diuersly: they all so a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the matter of his treatise, as yet they vary about the coherence and knitting of these three following Chap ters to the former. Some thinke that he climeth vp to the mystery of election, that he may lay foorth the fountain of faith and iustification; and so proue them to be free and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant vpon vs. Others say this depends on Chapter 3. verse 29. where the Apostle hauing prooued righte ous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse by faith; now he setteth on the other thing, to proue that it comes without respect of persons, both to Iew and Gentile which beleeue, and that according to election. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fetch the coherence from verse 30, or 38. 39. of the eight Chapter, thus: If God will glorifie whome hee fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knewe, and the faithfull cannot bee separated from Gods loue; how comes it that the Iewes whome God foreknew once, and which are Gods onely people, are now cast out and repelled from grace and glory? Vnto which he answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth;
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:20835:324"/>
that all which be Iewes by carnall generation, be not the people of God vnto whome the promises doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, but the elect alone, whether Iewes or Gentiles. But I take it rather this to be the reason of the connexion, that against the former doctrine of iustification by faith, the vnbeleefe of the Iewes might bee obiected thus: If <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine bee true (which hitherto hee hath taught, of the right way of being iustified and saued thorough faith in Christ) why doe not the Iewes approue and embrace it? either the Iewes are none of Gods people, or the doctrine and promises of grace belong to them; if not to them, then how is God faithfull in keeping promise, seeing hee sayed hee would be their God? Vnto which the Apostle answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that the Iewes obtained not righteousnesse and salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Christ; because many of them were vnbeleeuers. The reason of this is, because they were reprobates; for such as were elect did beleeue and were iustified and saued, which is sufficient to proue God true of his promise, which was neuer made but to <hi>Abrahams</hi> spirituall seede, not to such as came of him according to the flesh.</p>

                     <p>To auoide the offence of the Iewes, who were likely to take indignation at this doctrine; therefore hee vseth an insinuation to gaine their good will: for which purpose he also prayseth them, ver. 4. 5.

                     <p>That a Christian must alwaies speake trueth, but especially in an oath; the reason is, because an vntrueth vttered in an oath, is not onely a lye, but it is a periurie, which is a greater sinne.

                     <p>First, they teach vs that Gods children bee not stockes, blockish and sencelesse. Secondly, that we ought to bee touched with a feeling one of anothers misery. Thirdly, that aboue all other miseries we are bound ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly to grieue for the vnbeleefe and destruction of others, because that is the greatest euill, and therefore it should most affect vs. Fourthly, it is best knowne what loue we beare vnto others, by our griefe for their harms.

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>The truth is, <hi>Paul</hi> makes no such prayer, and if<note place="margin">A thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of, that for Christs sake one should wish to be separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Christ. <hi>Hierom</hi> Like to that of Christ, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if it be possible. So ought <hi>Moses</hi> prayer to be vnderstood, Exod. Blot me out, &amp;c.</note> he had, he had sinned greatly in praying vnlawfully and vainely. The reasons be, first because his prayer had cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the constant purpose of God, and his owne certaine perswasion spoken of in the former Chapter. Secondly, <hi>Paul</hi> was not bound to preferre the saluation of the <hi>Iews</hi> before Christ and his grace.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>The sence of the Apostles words is thus much: that he could haue wished to be cut off from Christ, and so to haue deliuered the <hi>Iewes</hi> from damnation, by the losse of his owne saluation, had it beene possible. For the speech is conditionall, (if it might haue beene) hee could haue wished to be damned for them, that he being but one, had rather perished then such a multitude. Like vnto that speech of <hi>Dauid,</hi> wishing that hee might haue dyed for his sonne <hi>Absolon:</hi> which as it bewrayeth <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uids</hi> affection for his sonne, so this sufficiently discouers <hi>Pauls</hi> exceeding great affection for the Iewes, how great it was. But as <hi>Dauid</hi> knew that his life could not redeem the death of his sonne (being already dead,) so it fared with <hi>Paul.</hi>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It teacheth that Christians must be carried with a great desire of others saluation, and namely of such as
<pb n="660" facs="tcp:20835:327"/>
neerest vnto them, as their kinsmen, children, seruants, stocke or linage. The reason is, because saluation is the greatest good wee can procure to any, therefore in the furthering of it, our loue should most appeare.</p>

                     <p>It reproues such as earnestly desire other good things to theirs, but are cold in descrying and seeking the chiefe good. Secondly, it comforteth all that finde any measure of this desire in them, that they are guided by the Spirit of God. Lastly, it exhorts all men to striue for a greater measure of it, because it will be a witnes that they are led by the same Spirit that was in <hi>Paul.</hi>

                     <p>They are all taken from the noble properties of the Iewes, and those adioynts or qualities which are in number ten, whereof now wee will speake in order. The first is, that they were his brethren or kinsmen according<note place="margin">This was a priuate condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, next is publike.</note> to the flesh; this is a great occasion to make vs loue our neighbour so much the more, as Christ did this nation, and his owne mother, and as nature teacheth euen heathen to doe, as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 8. Their second property is, that they were Israelites (that is, Gods people) such as were Princes and conquerers of God. This name God for honour sake<note place="margin">The chosen people of God, his flocke, his sheep, his lot, his inherita<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce consecrated to the true God: not as Athens, I: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los, Sicilia, were dedicate to false Gods, which yet they reckned their honors.</note> gaue to <hi>Iacoh</hi> who ouercame God in wrestling, see <hi>Genesis</hi> 33. 38. thereof called (Israel:) and he thought it an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent blessing, to haue his children called by his name (Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el) as ye may see in his prayer, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 16 And this is the second cause of his so great griefe for their destruction, that a people consecrated to the true God, who delighted to be called the God of Israel, should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. The third property is adoption, by which wee are not to vnderstand that eternall adoption peculiar to the elect, whome God purposed before all worlds, to make his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in Christ; and accordingly doth actually adopt them in time, when he calleth them effectually: but the external adoption, to be accounted and esteemed the onely Church of God, all other Nations and people being passed by and<note place="margin">Ephe. 1. 4 5.</note> refused: by vertue of which dignity, God himselfe calleth Israel his Sonne, yea his first borne, yea his treasure, &amp;c. <hi>Exodus</hi> 4. 22. and 19. 5. 6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32, 8. 9. <hi>Iere.</hi> 31. 20. <hi>I am their Father, and Ephraim is my childe and first borne.</hi> And this is the third cause of his sorrow, that they should be lost which had so worthy a priuiledge.</p>
                     <p>Their fourth property is the [glory,] by which is meant the Atke, which was a token of Gods presence; 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 21. 22. There also God hearde the prayers and prayses of his people, and gaue forth oracles vnto such as sought them; and in regard of it, the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple is called the habitation of his glory, or the place where his honour dwelleth, <hi>Psal.</hi>

26. 8. Therefore no people (as it is in Deut.) so noble to whom God came so nigh as to this people. Now what a griefe to a good friend is this, that such a nation should be cast out and anathanized.</p>
                     <p>Their first priuiledge and quality was the couenant, that is, the Table of the couenants, by a Metonymie: and hee speakes in the plurall number, because there were two Tables, Deut. 9. 11. in these God wrote with his owne hand his Morall Lawes and Statutes. Some vnderstande it of the couenant which God often made with this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for eternall life by Christ, howbeit this was but one, howsoeuer it was often renued with <hi>Abraham &amp; Isaac, &amp;c.</hi> Also the promises which are after named, cannot be seuered from the couenant which stoode in promises of eternall and temporall happinesse.</p>
                     <p>The sixt property is the giuing of the Law, to wit; the iudicial Law for the Common-wealth, which surpassed all the Lawes of <hi>Solon, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>, Numa, Draco, Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stocles,</hi> and <hi>Mines.</hi> For they came from heauen (God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the immediate authour) and were full of equitie, a meruailous credit and renowne to this Nation, as Deut. 4, 8, 32.</p>
                     <p>Their seauenth property was (the seruice of God) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the Priest-hood, with such outward rites and sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices wherein God would be lawfully serued of the Iews till Christ: and this was the ceremoniall worship, Hebr. 9, 1. This was so perfect, that nothing could be added to it. The eight property was the promises both Legall, promising life on condition of keeping the law perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: also Euangelical, promising remission of sinnes with saluation in heauen, to the beleeuers in Christ, temporal promises, and eternall promises, and of the calling of the Gentiles. No people had such promises, by which God sought to alure and inuite this people to his obedience. Their ninth priuiledge and dignity, was, that of them came the Fathers (that is) they bee the off-spring of the Patriarkes and holy men, whose praise is in the Worde,
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:20835:328"/>
which also had the promises of Gods mercie vnto theyr posterity, for a thousand generations, Gen. 17, 4. Com. 2. and this is no vsuall commendation, to come and to bee borne of such noble progenitors, as <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> were, by whose example they might haue great help to piety, and pricks to godlinesse, yet so farre to degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate as now the Iewes were, this could not but much greeue the Apostle who much loued them.

                     <p>That it is a great gift of God to come of holye parents and godly predecessors, farre more then to come of noble or honourable progenitours.

Psal. 112. 2. <hi>The generation of the righteous shall bee blessed.</hi> Secondly, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

are greatly furthered in their education by vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Parents. Thirdly, the examples of good Parents are spurres to children to quicken them to follow them; for it were a shame to degenerate and grow out of kinde, bringing infamy to our stocke and house.</p>

                     <p>Thus; If the Iewes be separate from Christ, then<note place="margin">Coherence.</note> Gods promises faile. For God promised Abraham to be his God, and the God of his seede: which promise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned Christ to bee giuen them, and saluation by him: but if the Iewes which be Abrahams seede bee accursed, hauing lost Christ and his saluation, then howe did God stand to his promise? Againe, the promise of the Messiah, was chiefly and first made to the Iewes. No we, if more Gentiles be saued by him then Iewes, how doth GOD keepe his promise? Hence it might be coniectured, Pauls griefe to arise, because God seemed inconstant, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing promise? which the Apostle denies, and answeareth<note place="margin">Method.</note> this cauill by a strong negation or deniall. Secondly, by a distinction of Abrahams seede, which distinction hee confirmes both by the word of God, and from the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of Gods eternall election and reprobation; which mystery vpon this occasion he openeth and prooueth in Hypothesis, by particular instances giuen of some persons<note place="margin">Summe.</note> elect, and some reprobate. The summe of this answer is this; that the true Iewes to whom Gods promises were made, were to be esteemed neither by woorthynesse of blood, carnall generation, nor by any workes present or
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:20835:330"/>
foreseene, but by Gods election. The elect onely were the true Israelites and children of Abraham: and therefore so long as God fulfilled his promise of saluation to the elect, he cannot be counted false of his word and promise made to Abraham, howsoeuer many thousands which descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded carnally of Abraham be lost.</p>

                     <p>This, howsoeuer many men doe perish, to whome<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> the promises bee offered and preached, yet God is euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more true and constant in performing his promise. This doctrine may be proued first by scripture, Mat. 5. 18. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen<note place="margin">Reasons</note> and earth shall passe away &amp;c. 2 Sam. 7. 28. Rom. 3. 4. 2 Cor. 1. 20. Secondly by reason, as first from the nature of God, who is trueth itselfe, and therefore he cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue. Thirdly, hee is vnchangeable, and therefore what he sayeth he will do. Fourthly, he is powerfull and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore able to keepe his promise, Rom. 4. 21. Fiftly, GOD standeth vpon his honour, and it were against his honour to break his promise; as it is written, I will not giue my glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:20835:331" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to another. Moreouer, this doctrine may bee declared and illustrated by comparison, thus. If honest men keepe their promise, much more God, whose fidelity and trueth is infinite: and lastly this may be proued by iust and long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience: for it was neuer knowne in any age, but what promises God mercifully made, hee did faithfully keepe; no one instant to be giuen to the contrary, thorough the whole booke of God.</p>

                     <p>That the promise of grace and saluation was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strayned<note place="margin">Summe.</note> vnto <hi>Iacob</hi> by election onely before he was born, not by his birth nor by his workes; for then <hi>Esau</hi> should haue obtained the blessing promised (who came of the same Parents) and yet was reiected and hated of GOD: therefore all which carnally come of <hi>Abraham,</hi> be not the children of the promise.</p>

                     <p>By a gradation, as a thing greater and stronger<note place="margin">Coherence.</note> to proue his purpose, that the promise of grace and saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth not indifferently and equally pertaine vnto all the posterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but to such of them onely as were elect. For the Iewes might obiect that <hi>Ismael</hi> was reiected because hee was borne of a bondwoman (to wit, <hi>Agar;</hi>) whereas no such thing could be alleadged in this example of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> who both came of <hi>Isaac, Abrahams</hi> lawfull Son, and of <hi>Rebecka</hi> at one time and by one birth, yea and <hi>Esau</hi> was the elder of the twaine: so as this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fits the Apostle much better, to she we that the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiue of carnal birth, is not the cause of receiuing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Yea but the Iewes might alleadge that Esau being a<note place="margin">Method.</note> prophane man, and behauing himselfe ill, was therefore reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: whereas Iacob was loued and had the effect of the promise because he was a good man and did well.</p>

                     <p>The Apostle meeteth with this obiection, in saying that Gods purpose was declared touching them both, ere euer they were borne; and therefore their present good

or euill works (for they had done none when God had vttered his counsell of them,) could not moue God to loue the one, and hate the other.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Yet it may be said that God decreed of them both, for the fore-seene workes of them both.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Paul</hi> denieth this, saying it was not of workes, and affirmeth the quite contrary, that the purpose of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <hi>Iacob,</hi> and of refusing <hi>Esau,</hi> came of his free election, whereby of his loue he chused the one, &amp; not the other. Thus whereas the Iewes stood much vpon the priuiledge of their birth and their works, <hi>Paul</hi> reiecteth them both as no causes of Gods promises, which are applied and take place by the decree of Gods election. The mystery whereof, vpon this occasion he beginneth to open both particularly by example, and generally by testimony of Scripture, verse 15, 16. and in the rest of the Chapter.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That faith nor good workes, neither present or<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> foreseene, are any cause why God electeth any vnto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. And contrariwise, infidelity and badde workes, whether present or foreseene, doe not moue God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse any man and cast him off from hauing any parte in Christ, and the promises by him. The reason is, faith and<note place="margin">Reason.</note> good works doe proceede from election, therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee the cause thereof; for one thing cannot bee the cause and effect in respect of another. Now that faith and workes be effects, see Acts 13, 48. Titus, 1, 1. Ephe. 1, 4. No man hath any good but what God purposed from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting to put into him. Secondly, Gods election depends vpon his will onely, verse 15. therefore not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on foreseene faith and workes. Thirdly, infidelity fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene and bad workes, were not the cause that men were refused, because all sinning in <hi>Adam,</hi> God could see in whole mankind no other thing but vnbeleefe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence, which hereditarily flowed from <hi>Adam</hi> vpon all his race; and so all had beene reiected for sinne fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene

if any were cast out.</p>

                     <p>But if wicked men be destroyed for vnbeleefe and bad works, then God decreed to destroy them in respect of these.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>It is true, so he did, but hee refused and did not chuse them, onely because hee would not chuse them, without all respect to their ill qualities and works. It is otherwise with the elect, whom God did appoint in his eternall decree vnto saluation, not in respect of their workes, but in and for Christ; yet so as hee purposed in time to call, to iustifie and to sanctifie them, ordaining to these things, not for these things.</p>

                     <p>It reproues such as tye Gods predestination to<note place="margin">Vse.</note> mens merites, whereas it is independant and without all relation, to the worthinesse and vnworthinesse of men. Secondly, it moueth the beleeuers to thanke God for their free election, and to ascribe all to grace: because free election is not onely in it selfe a great mercy, but it is the spring of all other mercies, both earthly and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly whatsoeuer. For sinners beleeue, and receiue the holy Ghost, and are borne anew, and blessed with repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and good workes, because they are Gods chosen and elect ones.</p>

                     <p>That the saluation of beleeuers, depends not<note place="margin">Summe.</note> at all on our selues, but is all wholy to be ascribed to the election of God. Whereas all men are alike by creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and nature, and yet some beleeue, doe good workes
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:20835:335"/>
and are saued, others beleeue not, but liue wickedly and doe perish, the cause of this difference is not in nobility of birth and bloud, or dignity of workes (as the example of <hi>Esau</hi> &amp; <hi>Iacob</hi> sheweth) but in the election of God chusing some to life according to his will, and refusing others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee would not chuse them. Summarily, that which putteth the difference betweene one man and another, all men beeing alike, is Gods eternall election before all worlds. Whence it is, that some are not called to Christ, and some be, and of those which bee called, some beleeue being elect, &amp; some do not beleeue, being not elect. Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being the fountaine of all our weale, therfore it would be taught distinctly, and well vnderstood, for it is a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall doctrine, reuealed in the Scripture.</p>

                     <p>Two-fold, one humane whereby men chuse who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <p>Twofold also, one is to an office, as <hi>Iudas</hi> was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected to an Apostleship. The second is to grace and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were elected. <hi>I haue not chosen you all, one is a Diuell,</hi> yet <hi>Iudas</hi> was chosen one of the twelue.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>Yea there be, because holy Scripture mentioneth both in this and sundry other places, as Tit, 1, 1. Ephe. 1, 4. Rom. 11, 5. 2. Iohn, 1. 1. Thes. 1, 4. 2. Thes. 3, 13. &amp; else-where

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It is an eternall decree of God, purposing out of lost mankinde, some persons to bee saued by faith in<note place="margin">Definition. What electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is.</note> Christ, to the praise of God; and not chusing others but refusing them and appointing them to wrath. Herewith agreeth <hi>Augustine,</hi> saying; Predestination is a purpose in God, to haue mercy on some for Christ; and reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the purpose not to haue mercy.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Because it is written, God loued <hi>Iacob</hi> ere hee<note place="margin">1. Election eternall.</note> was borne, Rom. 9, 11. Also <hi>Paul</hi> saith so expresly, Ephe. 1, 4. before the foundation of the world was laid. The word predestination and fore-knowledge, prooueth it, for they note a precedent eternall counsel.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Then they erre which thinke election to bee all one with calling.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>They doe so: for calling is a fruite of election, and is done in time after wee are borne, but election is before all time, and is the cause of our calling, as Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, 8, 30.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Also if some onely be chosen, then they are deceiued<note place="margin">2. Particular.</note> which will haue all to be chosen of God.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>True: First, then should all beleeue and be saued, because God changeth not. Secondly, because where all be chosen, there is no election, which is a chusing of some out of many. Thirdly, we haue examples of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates, as <hi>Caine, Esau, Iudas, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Is there then a decree of reprobation as well as of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>There is so: for election is not the chusing and<note place="margin">3. Election in ferreth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</note> taking of all, (as appeareth by <hi>Gideon,</hi> Iudges, 7, 7. and Deut. 7, 6.) but a taking of some, with a forsaking of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Secondly, Scripture speaketh of appointment to wrath, 1. Thes. 5, 9. and of an ordination to disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, 1. Pet. 2, 7. and to damnation, Iude, 4. Thirdly, experience teacheth this, because many vnbeleeuers and
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:20835:336"/>
wicked men haue beene and be in the world; which she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth that many be reprobates &amp; refused, from whence it commeth, that they cannot haue faith and godlinesse, Iohn 10, 26. <hi>They beleeue not, because they be not my Sheep.</hi>

Also it appeareth that some be reprobated, because elect and reprobates bee opposed as contrarie, in Esay 41, 9. Lastly, God hath made Vessels some to mercie and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and some to wrath and dishonour, Rom. 9. And fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, our experience telleth and teacheth this, whilest daily wee see some called and altered, others abyde in their sinne.</p>

                     <p>Christ Iesus, into whome hee purposed to ingrast vs, as members into an head whome hee purposed to saue: see <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1. 4. The reason hereof is, because wee are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen with respect of Christes merites, as the materiall cause or meane whereby all elect ones were to be saued.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>The cause is in himselfe, his own purpose and wil, calling vs to himselfe of his meere purpose and good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 18. Not workes past, for men are chosen from euerlasting; nor workes present, for <hi>Iacob</hi> was loued and chosen ere hee was borne; not woorkes foreseene, for men were all corrupt in <hi>Adam:</hi> and not by workes, which in none are good by nature, but euill in all<note place="margin">Oracles is of the purpose of God, and the good plea sure of him who calleth. <hi>Origen.</hi>
                        </note> (contrary to <hi>Palagians;</hi>) not foreseen faith, for it is giuen according to election, whereof it is a fruite, and then wee had chosen God and not hee vs: yea, nor Christ is not the impulsiue or moouing cause: for the loue of God moued him to giue his Sonne. And finally, not our worthinesse or vnworthinesse, for by naturall corruption wee are all alike vnworthy, for <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> were equall in this.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Giue vs some reasons to proue that nothing in man could moue God to chuse him.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, then election should not remaine firme by him which calleth, but depend vppon some good thing in our selues, be it faith or workes, that the purpose of GOD might remaine firme by merites; which is directly against the text here. Secondly, then we should haue some good thing in vs which God giueth not. Thirdly, then grace should not be the high and soueraigne cause of all good, if there were something in vs before it, as a moouing cause. Fourthly, election is deriued from grace, and not from ought in vs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 6. Fiftly, all good things come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:20835:337"/>
the grace of election, as effects and fruites of it, Ephe. 1, 4. Sixtly, election is referred to the will and mercy of God in this Chapter, verse 16, Seauenthly, God hath as much right ouer men, as a Potter ouer his pots, which for his will sake, he maketh noble or base.</p>
                     <p>Eightly, <hi>Paul</hi> saw no other cause of election but the will of God, and it is dangerous to assigne that to bee a cause of election which <hi>Paul</hi> purposely entreating of this matter saw not; this is to make our selues wise, and him blockish, nay our selues wiser then the Holy-Ghost. Ninthly, if the cause of election were workes or faith, or vnbeleefe cause reprobation, what need he say, Oh the<note place="margin">Election com meth from the will of the Elector, not from any thing in the elected.</note> depth, or obiect, Is their iniquity with God? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it necessarily followeth, that election is most free and absolute, without any dependance vpon them. Yet God did not chuse vs to the end without respect to the meanes, for his decree concerneth both meanes and the end. This is sufficient to stoppe the clamours of the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans.</hi>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Doe ye thinke so of reprobation, that it is free also with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dependance on infidelity or ill workes fore-seene?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>In that some are not chosen to life, it is without<note place="margin">Reprobation priuatiue and positiue.</note> all respect of their vnbeleefe, as a mouing cause; but in that they are not onely refused, but also appointed vnto destruction, this is not without reference to infidelity &amp; sinne, which as it is the proper cause of damnation, so it moued God to ordaine to destruction, but not to refuse and cast out from saluation: for this was done to <hi>Esau</hi> ere he had done euill. Secondly, it is written, God hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth whom he will; his will then is the high and first cause why men are not saued. Thirdly, God as a Potter may<note place="margin">We ought to be content with this that Gods will is the onely cause of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Phocius.</hi>
                        </note> make vessels to ignominy for his wils sake. Fourthly, as we were corrupt in <hi>Adam,</hi> God could see nothing in any man, saue vnbeleefe and sinne. And therefore if these had moued him not to chuse, all had beene reprobated, then <hi>Paul</hi> also should haue said that the purpose might remaine according to merite. Lastly, there is no vnrighteousnesse
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:20835:338"/>
to cast off and refuse for sinne, all will confesse this to bee iust.</p>

                     <p>They be so: for first, <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Isaac</hi> were chosen to the grace of the promise, verse 8. but this compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends al. Secondly, it were absurd to separate the means from the end, or end from the meanes. Thirdly, Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture speaketh thus, Acts 13, 48. <hi>So many as were ordained to life beleeued.</hi> Fourthly, hec speaketh of election, which is a preparation of the Vessell of mercie to glorie, and which is ioyned with loue, which is a willing of eternal life to men, and all things which bring thither.</p>

                     <p>It confuteth the Papists, which say it is to grace, and not to glory; this they attribute to mans merits. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it reprooues such as thinke themselues elect to life, they wanting notwithstanding the meanes of effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall calling and good life. Thirdly, it comforts such as haue the means; that they are sure they be elected to the end, for meanes and end be linked together.</p>

                     <p>No they cannot, for the purpose remaines firme. Secondly, God is vnchangeable, and his loue is so too.

Secondly, because many are called which be not chosen, it should stirre vp all sorts of Christians to examine their owne hearts, whether they haue obeyed their Calling, hauing their hearts changed from vnbeleefe and loue of sinne, to faith, and loue, and practise of righteousnesse. Thirdly, let such as yet feele not this calling, not dispair, for who knoweth what may be tomorrow? God calleth and turneth at all houres, Mat. 20, 1, 2.

My reasons for this bee; first because <hi>Iacob</hi> in his owne person neuer ruled ouer <hi>Esau,</hi> but rather <hi>Esau</hi> ruled ouer him, as appeareth plainely by the story; yet this oracle did concerne the person, as it is manifest by the words of his Father when he blessed him. Secondly, the birth-right had the promise of grace and heauenly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance annexed to it. Thirdly, <hi>Malachy</hi> shewes, Chapter first, the rule of <hi>Iacob</hi> to be ioyned with Gods loue, being an effect of it, and the seruitude of <hi>Esau</hi> to come from his hatred, as a fruite of it; therefore this first testimony must needes bee vnderstoode of heauenly thinges, and not of earthly.</p>

                     <p>First, it warnes all Christians very diligently to read the Scripture after <hi>Pauls</hi> example, who gathered the deepe mystery of Gods predestination out of this oracle, being duely pondered, that it was spoken while the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were in their mothers wombe, and of such as came of the same parents by the same conception, at the same time; and withall carefully comparing it with the other place of <hi>Malachy,</hi> found that all must wholly bee commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the decree and purpose of God, and to nothing that either was or should be in the children.</p>

                     <p>That examples serue well to make cleere and plaine the generall doctrines of Scripture; for heere <hi>Paul</hi>

to moue himselfe to accept grace offered, or in <hi>Esau</hi> to refuse it, for as much as before their birth, grace was purposed to the one and not to the other.</p>

                     <p>That exceeding great is the efficacy of the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God. For that must be very effectuall and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which altereth both the corruption of nature, and the law of nature. First, it altereth the corruption of nature, because <hi>Iacob</hi> by nature was as sinfull as <hi>Esau,</hi> yet the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of grace called and reformed him, while <hi>Esau</hi> stil did sticke in his naturall vncleannesse. Secondly, it cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the law of nature, for by natures lawe the younger should haue serued the elder: but by election God pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing it so, the elder is made subiect to the yonger.</p>

                     <p>Now come to the second Oracle and tell vs from<note place="margin">2. Oracle.</note> whence the words be taken?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>Out of the Prophet <hi>Malachy,</hi> Chap. first, verse, 2, 3.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>But Malachy speaketh of temporall benefits, as the<note place="margin">A doubt.</note> land of Canaan giuen to the Israelites, and of earthly afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the Mount Seir being barren, to be giuen the Edomites, what is this touching election vnto eternall life?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It is true, he doth so, but not onely of such. The drift of the Prophet is to reproue the vnthankfulnesse of<note place="margin">Solution.</note> the Iewes towards God, whom they neyther feared nor<note place="margin">How this text doth fit the purpose of <hi>Paul.</hi>
                        </note> honoured, yet he loued them. Againe, God preferred <hi>Iacob</hi> before his brother <hi>Esau,</hi> for he gaue to the posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Iacob</hi> a good land, and being for their sinnes driuen out, hee promiseth to bring them backe, but the barren and waste country of the <hi>Edomites</hi> he would destroy, so as no man should build and restore it. These be earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinges, by which no man can know loue or hatred. Suppose the Prophet spoke but of earthly thinges as a fruite-ful and barren land, yet these falling to the poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> not by their merites, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Gods will, it is sufficient for his scope. For the generall drift of the Apostle, is to shew that whereas <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> was prefered vnto <hi>Esau</hi> were it but in earthly things,
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:20835:341"/>
the cause heereof, was not in their workes, but in Gods goodnesse and purpose.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>But how may it bee proued that in this testimony the<note place="margin">A doubt.</note> Prophet comprehendeth things belonging to saluation?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, because all Gods blessings had their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation<note place="margin">Solution.</note> in Christ, and in the couenant of grace through him. For if God gaue the Israelites <hi>Canaan</hi> as a more fruitefull land, it was because he was mercifull to them; now certainly God is mercifull to his people no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then for Christs sake, in whom hee is well pleased, Mat. 3, 17. Therefore vpon the promise of Christ, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends all externall blessings giuen to the faithfull before the comming of Christ. Secondly, the possession of the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was not simply promised and giuen to <hi>Iacob</hi> and his posterity, but as a type, figure, and signe of the heauenly inheritance, Heb, 11, 13, 14, 15. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth <hi>Paul</hi> proue the election of <hi>Iacob</hi> to eternal life by the enioying of that land, and the reprobation of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sau,</hi> by thrusting him and his posterity out of it. Then these temporall thinges were effects and signes of Gods loue and hatred.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>But that was spoken of the posterity of Iacob and Esau, how well doth it agree vnto their persons?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It agreeth vnto both, though principally vnto <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> as the two Authors, yet so as that some of <hi>Esaus</hi> posterity might be saued, and of <hi>Iacobs</hi> prosterity some might be damned, without any impeachment vnto this truth, namely; that God chuseth vnto saluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> most freely whomsoeuer he electeth.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>To loue is to will vnto one the greatest good, euen eternall saluation, and all things which bring thither.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>First; purpose. Secondly, manifestation. As in our loue to others, first wee wish them good whom we loue, and then wee doe them good: as in the example of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:20835:341"/>
friends, husbands, &amp;c. So it is in God; hee purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth all good to his Children, chusing them from euerlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be saued by Christ, and afterwards when they come into the world, he makes knowne his loue by their effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all calling, sanctifying and renuing their hearts, ingende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in them a study of good workes, strengthening them to an vpright obedience, and perseuerance in grace, and finally glorifying them in heauen, Rom. 8, 38, 39, 30. Iohn 3, 17. Rom. 5, 5.</p>

                     <p>But if wee were alwayes loued of God, how were wee then his enemies?</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Wee were enemies because of sinne, which God extreamely hateth, but loued because of his election and mercy. Though hee out of his purpose decreed the cheef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est good to his children, yet while they sticke and remaine in their naturall corruption being out of Christ, they were children of wrath, enemies, vngodly, &amp;c.

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That our saluation and all that appertaineth to it,<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> springeth altogether from Gods eternall loue. The reasons<note place="margin">Reason.</note> heereof bee, first because God being most free, would not fetch the cause of our saluation from any other thing then from himselfe. Secondly, because there can no higher, or former cause of mans good bee giuen then Gods good pleasure. Thirdly, to beat downe the pride of mans heart that hee might not glory in his owne merites, but render the whole praise of his saluation, and whatso euer belongs thereto to the free loue of God in Christ.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Not so neither, but contrarily the loue of God did moue him both to purpose and to giue Christ for our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and therfore could not be the impulsiue cause to Gods loue, to the which it is subordinate, and not superior.

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It teacheth a difference betweene Gods loue and our loue, his wayes and our wayes; for we are not bounde to loue or to chuse any person but in respect of his worth, euen in our enemies we are to esteem Gods creation and adoption in them, as grounds of our loue: but with God there is no such matter, who findes no cause of louing vs out of himselfe, vnlesse we speak of his actuall loue which he bare vs in time, and hath reference to his owne image restored in vs, Psal. 11, 7. Secondly, hence wee haue a spurre giuen vs to quicken vs to thankfulnesse, when we consider that both for our selues and whatsoeuer good thing we haue, we are beholden to Gods eternall mercy for it. Thirdly, wee must endeauour in euery blessing that wee haue, to see the loue of God in it, since his loue is the fountaine of all good, eyther temporall or spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all that comes vnto vs. Lastly, wee are warned as God loued vs freely, so to loue him freely, not for his benefit onely, or feare of punishment, but meerely for himselfe: In louing God, studying to loue God his infinite most sweet loue, grace, mercy, bounty, and all other thinges in him and for him.</p>

Thirdly, to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with things done against his law. God is not saide to hate <hi>Esau</hi> in this last sence, for hee was hated of God before hee had done any euill; but in the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer meanings God hated him: for he did not elect him, and hee appointed to destroy him in regard of those sins which he should commit after he was borne.</p>

                     <p>The obiection is, that there is iniquitie with God, or that God is vniust. It doth arise from the pride of mans corrupt reason, rebelling against the counsell of God.</p>

                     <p>Two things especially. The first thing is, that God should hate some and loue others onely, for his wil sake, without respect to worthines or vnworthines: by which meanes the bad may be loued, and the good may be hated. Secondly, reason ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not perceiue how of them which are in like case, some should be chosen, and others refused, or how they which are equall, should vnequally be dealt withal without iniustice: as if a Iudge of two malefactors, should acquit one, and punish the other: or a King of two valiant Captaines, should prefer the one, and disgrace the other. Reason seeth not this to be iust,
<pb n="692" facs="tcp:20835:343"/>
&amp; therefore thinketh it to be vniust in God, to saue some men and punish others, whereas all were sinners, &amp; lost alike.</p>

                     <p>First, because this mysterie (though it bee not contrary to sound reason) yet is aboue the reach of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, the naturall man perceiueth it not, euen as a sore eie cannot looke against the brightnesse of the sun. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, reason dreameth God to be subiect to humane lawes, and to be able to do no more to his creature then a Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster to his Seruant, or a King to his subiect: who are held to be vnrighteous, if in distributing paines and rewards they do not obserue a proportion.</p>

                     <p>What are we to learne from this Obiection?</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, that reason till it be reformed, is neyther subiect to God, nor can be, Rom. 8. therefore they must needs erre, which in diuine matters do consult with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reason; as he must needs loose his way which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes a blinde guide. Secondly wee learne, that it is no newe thing to barke and cauill against the Doctrine of Gods predestination, charging it with iniustice, and him with respect of persons; if it be so now, it was so in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles times. Thirdly, we learn, that the foreknowledge of God touching men what they would be, or not bee, was no cause of Gods decree in his election or reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because then there had beene no place for this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection to charge God with iniustice; for if he had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen such persons onely, whom he foresaw would be iust and righteous, and refused such as he foresaw would be wicked and vnbeleeuers, all men would haue acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged this to haue beene as iust proceeding: but when it is saide, that for his wils sake, such as were equall are distinguished, some purposed to life, others reprobated to death, this vnto reason sauours vnrighteous.</p>

                     <p>That it is our dutie to acknowledge God to bee righteous in all his decrees, workes and wordes, which hee doth in men, by men, or vppon men, or any other creature whatsoeuer: though the causes, reasons, &amp; ends of his doings may be hid from vs, yet we are bounde to adore them as holy and righteous.

Idem.</note> Psal. 5, 4. &amp; that he is righteous in all his waies. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he is the iudge of the world, and therefore cannot be vniust, Rom. 3. 5: Gen. 25, 18.

                     <p>It confutes such as set vp free will, and make the beginnings of their saluation to come from themselues, which as it directly crosseth the Scriptures, which teach that in our will or vnderstanding there is no goodnesse, till GOD put it in; so it derogateth much from the glory of Gods mercy, also too much exalteth and puffeth vp flesh and bloud. Secondly, though this may not quench and kill our care and endeuour of well doing, yet it must serue to humble vs, euen for our best desires and endeuours; for as much as they doe wholly spring from Gods mercy, and are of no value in the cause of election and saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

                     <p>First, it instructeth vs, that the mercie of God is arbitrarie, so as hee may shew it or not shewe it, as hee pleaseth. Also it teacheth, that the right that God hath ouer men, is absolute and independant: so as if hee will
<pb n="708" facs="tcp:20835:351"/>
shewe mercy to elect and call some which were as corrupt (as those which he giueth ouer to be hardned in sinne,) as it may and doeth greatly commend his goodnesse, so it doeth in no wise prooue him to be vniust, because in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which is vndue there can bee no iniustice. Lastly, it teacheth that our mercy which wee exercise towards men, must not respect their owne deseruings and merites, but be free, after the example of the Samaritane, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. The reason hereof is, because we are commaunded to bee mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisull, as God is mercifull, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 36. also the man Christ shewed mercy freely, for hee prayed for his enemies, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. 34. So did <hi>Steuen, Acts</hi> 7. also <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 9. 1. 2. Yet this letteth not, but that we ought to deale kindly to such as haue beene kinde to vs, and to pitty them that haue had mercy on vs, so as it be for the Lords sake, and not for our owne sake.</p>

                     <p>Heere the consequent is put for the antecedent, hardening the consequent of reprobation vppon which it depends, and also for the meanes, by which that decree is effected. That this is the meaning, is apparant by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of hardnesse to mercy, which plainly shewes that the one word is taken as largely as the other; that as mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy contaynes election, with all the degrees and meanes by which the elect are brought to glory; so hardnes contains reprobation, and all the meanes by which the reprobate are brought to destruction.</p>

Thirdly, desperate obstinacy, when after all meanes vsed of God, by his worde of iustice and mercy, instead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better and better, sinners grow worse and worse, more carelesse to please God and keepe his commeandements, and more frowarde in their behauiour toward God and man.</p>

<pb n="710" facs="tcp:20835:352"/>
as haue stony and brawny hearts, they bee in a fearefull condition, and had need to looke to it betimes. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it admonisheth all men to beware of and striue against hardnesse of heart, whereunto the neerer they are, the neerer they are to reprobation, and therefore let euery man examine himselfe, and with al diligence vse al means to soften their owne hearts.

                     <p>A new obiection against predestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with an answere to it. The first obiection was tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Gods vnfaithfulnesse, if he did reiect the Iewes to whom hee had promised to be their God. The second was of iniustice, if hee should elect some and not other some, without respect of any worthinesse or vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in themselues. Now in this our text they charge God with cruelty and extreame rigor. For if God har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den whom he will, and after punish them for that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, this seemes vnto carnall reason to be cruelty. This obiection is fortified and backt by two reasons closely coucht in this text. The first is this: It were cruelty in God to bee reuenged on that hardnesse which himselfe willeth, verse 19. But <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and all wicked men are hardened because God will, (as before verse 18,) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath no cause to be angry or to punish, or if hee doe, it seemeth to mans reason to bee all one, as if a man should binde his seruant, and after beate him because he did not his worke, or as if a Magistrate should bid a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner breake the Iayle, and yet hang him when hee hath done. The other reason is this: that God must bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted cruell, if he should punish that which men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not resist and auoyde: but the omnipotent will of God
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:20835:352"/>
whereby reprobates are hardened, cannot bee resisted, therefore the hardened without cruelty cannot bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended and punished.</p>

Againe, as it is true that we are freely iustified by faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, but heereof it will not follow that wee neede not doe good workes, as Papists blindly and badly collect. Also because in some Churches the Ministry or Leiturgy

may be faulty, we ought not therefore to conclude that we may not liue in such Churches where such defections be not amended, as if any would affirme a body to be no body, because it is a lame one, or an eye no eye because there is a web and pin in it.</p>

Secondly, though there be a necessity that they be har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, on whome God will shew no mercy, yet no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate is hardned against his owne will; for they are so farre from auoyding the hardnesse of their owne hearts, as that they rather contract it by their owne voluntary faults, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did, and as the obstinate Iewes did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, Iohn 8, 44.</p>

                     <p>First, it serues iustly to reprooue the audacious wickednesse of such men as are too busie to examine God and his wayes; why hee made the world no sooner, what hee did, and where hee was before the worlde; why hee made them men and women; why hee made some poore, and not all rich; why he would not chuse and saue all; why hee suffered <hi>Adam</hi> to fall, sithence he might haue kept him from sin, &amp;c. Such persons little consider how easie a thing it is, for that infinite maiesty to confound these curious fooles, with his very becke. Secondly, the godly are here to bee exhorted to bridle this wickednesse in themselues by a due meditation of Gods infinite greatnes, compared with their owne most pittifull smalnesse, being in respect of him, not so much as a droppe of water in respect of the whole sea, or as a little dimme candle to the light of the sun. How small a portion of that incomprehensible wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome doe we see? This therefore will bee our wisedome

to labour in al sincerity and humbly, to know, beleeue, and doe, that which wee by his word shall perceiue to belong to vs.</p>

                     <p>By a parable or similitude, wherein men are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to a pot of clay, and God to a Potter. The substance whereof is thus much; that as a pot may not finde fault with the Potter (howsoeuer hee make it, because hee hath full power ouer the clay, to make what hee will with it;) so God hath absolute power ouer men to dispose of them as he liketh, either to death or life, and therefore hee cannot be charged with cruelty, though he reiect and cast off some for his meere pleasure sake. This comparison our Apostle borroweth from other places of Scripture, as namely from <hi>Esay,</hi> 45. 9. and <hi>Iere.</hi> 18. 1. 2, 3.</p>

                     <p>No, they differ in these things. First, the potter hath matter (to wit) clay prepared to his handes, God made man of nothing. Secondly, man hath vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and will, the clay hath not so much as anie motion. Thirdly, it is a greater matter to destroy a man, than a pot of clay. Similitudes (saith <hi>Chrysostom</hi>) are not of force touching all parts, for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> many absurdities would followe, it is sufficient to holde in that for which it is brought.</p>

                     <p>First, as sundry pots be made out of one lumpe, so all men are made out of one masse, whether we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der men in the estate of their creation or corruption, yet the Originall &amp; beginning of all men (as touching their bodies. is all one and the same (to wit) clay or slime. Secondly the power and right that God hath ouer men, is as great as any potter can haue ouer the pot, yea, and much greater without comparison. Thirdly, the pot (if it could speake) may not reason with the Potter, why was I made so and not so: neither may man reason with God, why he made him thus or thus. Lastly, as the Potter of what forme soeuer the pot be made, taketh nothing fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, so neither doth God take any thing from man, what end soeuer he appoint him vnto. Man was beholden to God for whatsoeuer hee is or hath, but man gaue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to God.</p>

                     <p>In this wise (by an argument <hi>a minori</hi>) if the pot must rest in the will of the Potter, (without questioning or expostulating why it was made in this base forme, or to such a vile vse) much more are men to be satisfied with the will of their creator without repining or reasoning against it: if it be an vnworthy and vnreasonable thing for the pot to question with his Former, much more vnmeet is it that man should question with his Maker.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, because God himselfe being most iust, his will is the highest and most perfect rule of al righteousnes; insomuch that whatsoeuer it bee that is once knowne to bee willed of God, must without ali question and dispute bee helde for most vpright and iust, and cannot bee but a most grieuour sinne to quarrell with him, or to answer him againe.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, it serueth to stop the mouthes of all such as cauill at the doctrine of Gods most free predestination, whereas God expresly faith that he sheweth mercy where hee will, and sheweth not mercy where hee will not: these wicked men contend with God, and charge him to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell and tyranicall, when they heare it taught out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that for his meere will sake GOD doeth reprobate some, forgetting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues to be vnmatches with God, &amp; pulling vpon themselues worthily that woe threatned to things formed which striue with their Former. Esay 54. 9. Secondly, from hence are reprooued such as mislike any of Gods workes, as their owne estate or condition of life, or of the weather, or such like workes of God; as they which suppose and sticke not to speake that it had bin better for them that they had been made rich, or of more stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth &amp;c. what is this, but for the thing formed to picke quarrell or
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:20835:355"/>
prescribe lawes to the maker. Thirdly, heere is a warning vnto all the children of God, to holde themselues content in all things, with that which pleaseth God, doe it neuer so much exceede their reason, or crosse their affections; ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with reuerence and humility such iudgements of his, as they are not able to conceiue the true causes; after the example of <hi>Iob,</hi> chap. 1. and of <hi>Dauid,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 23.</p>

                     <p>The very text giueth power to the Potter, to put vpon the pot what forme and vse he will, with as good yea and much better reason it standeth, that the like power be ascribed vnto God; the reason is, because there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion betweene God and a Potter, who is by infinit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, inferiour to God. Secondly, the Potter hath the clay made to his hands, but Gods hand made all men; and therefore his right ouer men is farre greater then can bee the Potters ouer the Pot which is onely formed, and not created by him. For as touching God, his right is such and so absolute, that he might haue made man, or not haue
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:20835:356"/>
made him, hauing made him vpright, hee might haue brought him to nothing, as he made him of nothing; and all being corrupt in <hi>Adam</hi> he might haue reprobated and refused all without any wrong, nay most iustly: concerning all which, none could haue controuled him: sithence hee did all this not of any necessity of his nature, but out of the liberty of his will, and absolutenes of his power; which as it is vnsistable, so it is vncontroulable by flesh &amp; bloud, yea by any creature in earth or in heauen; the greatest men are vnder another, God at least is aboue them, but God is supreme, and hath none aboue him.</p>

                     <p>Yes, there is great difference; first, these Princes made not their subiects. Secondly, their power is limited by law, and conscience or religion; they be set vp by God, and must raigne for God. Thirdly, being sinfull men their luste and desire is sinfull, whereas Gods will is pure.

                     <p>This: that the vtmost end of reprobation is the manifestation of Gods power: and not simply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Reprobate, which is the nearest end in respect of the men themselues, and is no further respec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God, then as it tends to the declaration of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and Iustice. The reason of this doctrine is, because else in vain had God created the world, if it had not bin to manifest his glorious properties, whereof his power is one. Secondly, it was his will by this meanes to shewe forth his power, and why might he not?</p>

Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God being stronger then man, he is more to be feared then all men.

                     <p>It serues for a trial and examination of our selues, whether we be our of the ranke of reprobates, namely, if we finde that we haue profited by the patience and long sufferance of God towards vs, to the reformation of our wayes: also it serues for terror vnto such as are not made the better by the patience of God towards them. And lastly, it serues for comfort to such as are bettered by his long-suffering and kindnesse, thereby learning more to fear the offending of such a gracious God. This is a good token, and very comfortable.</p>

                     <p>Vessels they are called in respect of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination and creation. He fore-appointed and made them to some speciall vse, (as vessels be) euen to the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting foorth of his power and iustice, as was saide before. (Vessels of wrath) in regard of their owne sinnes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they corrupted and made themselues worthy of his wrath and punishment.</p>

                     <p>To be prepared, signifies to be made fit &amp; meet before hand, and this is done partly by God, eternally reiecting them; creating them in time, permitting them to fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> and iustly hardening them for resisting his will. Secondly, by Sathan, solliciting them to sin and inspiring into them sinne-full motions, obdurating them also in sinfull courses. Lastly, by themselues in regard of their naturall corruption and voluntary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prauation, following the lustes of their ignorance with greedinesse. Thus in regard of creation, and the end to the which they are ordained, reprobates are prepared of God; as also in regard of sinne (as it is a meanes to bring them to that end:) but respecting sinne (as it is sinne) which they bring of their owne, so they are prepared by themselues, and by Sathan.</p>
                     <p>Note that it is good diuinity taught from God, by the pen of the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> in plaine expresse tearmes, that there be some men which be vessels of wrath and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to destruction; &amp; that they know no diuinity, which deny this vpon pretence, least God be found vniust and tyrannicall. It is a safe thing in speaking, writing, or preaching, to follow the phrase and speech of the Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Ghost, rightly taken in the true sence; men may not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to bee wiser then God, nor thinke to defend Gods iustice by a lye. Such be miserable patrons of God and his righteousnesse. <hi>Bonum non indiget malo,</hi> nor truth hath no neede of falshood to prop and support it.</p>

                     <p>Very fitly; for <hi>Paul</hi> hauing prooued, that GOD doth most freely elect some and not others, because of his owne will, heereof question might bee moued, how we might know who are elected? Whereunto the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle secretly answereth, that election is manifested in our vocation vnto Christ by the Gospell. Calling is the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation and euidence of election.</p>

                     <p>Because the Apostle searching for a true testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of election, most needes meane that inward calling which is wrought by the Spirite effectually; seeing this is proper to the elect, being a certaine and necessary fruit of election.

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>First, it may be proued by these Scriptures, Rom. 8. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. <hi>Whom he hath predestinated, them be hath called;</hi> also v. 28. and Rom. 9. 11. and 2. Pet. 1, to election, purpose and calling, are often put together, as causes and effects, rootes and fruites. Secondly, reason prooueth it: for seeing God effectually calleth all whome hee, eternally predestinateth, and none others; therefore calling must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> be a manifestation of predestination to glory. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,<note place="margin">2. Reason.</note> if the Gospell bee the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious purpose for the sauing of the elect by Christ, 2. Ti, 1, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>. Therefore to haue this grace offered by the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell and truely to receiue it by an effectuall calling of the spirite, must needs be an euidence and declaration of the good will and purpose of God towards a man.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the end of a true calling is to bring vs vnto faith, which is an infallible note of election, Titus, 1, 1.<note place="margin">Similitudes.</note> Acts, 14. Iohn, 3. Lastly, this doctrine may bee set foorth by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, for as the sappe within the Tree is knowne by the fruite without, &amp; a mans secret thought is manifested by his voyce, and the Sunne is discerned to be lightsome by the beames, so the decree of election is in it selfe secret, but is opened by a true calling, which is as it were the beames, the fruite, the manifestation of Gods counsell towards the elect.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, it confutes the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, who teach that no<note place="margin">Vses.</note> man can ordinarily bee assured of his saluation, but by extraordinary reuelations. Secondly, it reprooues such as seeke the certainty of their election by diuing deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the secret counsell of God, as if they could know his mind, which is not to bee knowne but by the effects of it. Thirdly, it checks such as rashly censure the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of predestination as if it driue men to despaire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause men can neuer find the secret will of God; whereas a speciall vocation is a meane whereby to vnderstand it.
<pb n="731" facs="tcp:20835:362"/>

                        </gap> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as our calling is as it were a hand to leade vs to the verie secret place of God. Fiftly, this Doctrine serueth to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish all the godly (laying aside all other means) when they seeke for proofe of their own election) to go down into their owne hearts, to finde out that precious worke of Gods grace in their calling to Christ.</p>

                     <p>It is true: therefore there be some few tokens,<note place="margin">Solution.</note> by which a sauing vocation is to be discerned from that<note place="margin">Markes of a calling, which is effectuall.</note> which is common. As first, a distinct speciall knowledge of the word, not confusedly and generally. Secondly, to beleeue the promises of the Gospell with sincere loue to them, and ioy in them. Thirdly, to take sound delight in the whole word of God, euen the threatnings, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions, &amp; exhortations aswell as consolations.

Doctrine.</note> hope well of the saluation of others that be members of the visible Church. The seasons bee, first because they<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> haue the Sacraments of Gods grace, whereby they are

set apart and sealed vp to God to be his people. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, God inuiteth them by his word, to faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Thirdly, they make profession of God to be their father, and Christ their redeemer. Lastly, in their liues they doe yeeld outward obedience to the worde. Now charity requireth vs to think that al this is done in truth, and therefore to hope well of them, that they belong to Gods election; as <hi>Paul</hi> doth heere by speaking in the plurall number of others as well as himselfe.</p>

                     <p>Euen of such we are not to despaire, because we know not what to morrow will bring foorth. Also the parable of the vineyard, shewes that God calles at all houres, euen at the last: and the example of the theefe, and <hi>Paul,</hi> being wicked men, and yet called in the ende of their life, instruct vs that we must not cast away hope of any how wicked soeuer they bee; none more wicked then such as haue beene called. Also it is as easie for the infinite power to conuert a greeuous as a lesse sinner.</p>

                     <p>What then, is there no reprobation in the visible Church? none reiected which be in Noahs Arke, in the outward Church?</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Wee may not determine or giue finall sentence vpon any that they are Reprobates, Rom. 14, 10, 11, 12, but leauing secret things to God, who onely knoweth who be his, and who bee not, 2. Tim. 2, 19. wee doe so out of charity hope well of all, as yet wee holde it for a certaine truth, that all in the visible Church be not elect. That this is so, appeareth first by Scripture, Math. 20. 16. Many called, few chosen, also 1. Iohn, 2, 29. Some went out from vs, that were not of vs. Againe, the Iewes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods people, it is written of them that they were not all Christs sheepe, nor giuen vnto him of his Father, Iohn, 10, 29. nor were Iewes within, Rom. 2, 29. nor children of the promise, Rom. 9, 4. nor the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Iohn, 8, 39. Secondly, this truth may bee
<pb n="734" facs="tcp:20835:364"/>
proued by the similitudes of Scripture, which set foorth the estate of the visible Church, for it is likened vnto a floore hauing wheate and chaffe, Mat. 3, 12. to a dragge, net hauing good fish and badde, Mat. 13, 47. to a fielde of tares as well as of good Corne, Mat. 13, 24. to a house wherein are vessels of earth and of gold; to Noahs Arke, wherein were vncleane beasts, as wel as cleane. Thirdly, it may bee confirmed by examples, as of <hi>Esau,</hi> Rom. 9. 12. and <hi>Iudus,</hi> Iohn, 6, 70. who were both reprobates, and yet liued in the visible Church; so of <hi>Caine, Ismael, Saul, D. mas.</hi> Lastly, this appeares by reason, because<note place="margin">Reason.</note> were all elect, all must be saued, which is not true, Mat. 7, 13, Secondly, it opens a gap to security. Thirdly, were all elect, then should all haue an effectuall calling to Christ, Mat. 13. and 20. Wee are therefore thus to holde and beleeue, that the holye and inuisible Church consists onely of elect and none other: But in the visible Church there be both Goats and Sheepe, chosen and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused ones. The infallible distinction whereof pertaines to God alone.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>I he cause heereof is manifold; not for that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty one were such in truth, as Israell an holy Nation, yet had many hypocrites among them, but first because they were all such by externall vocation, whereby beeing se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from the rest of the vncleane world, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated to Christ.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they all had the sacrament of sanctification, an outward seale of election. Thirdly, because the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of certainty belongs to God onely, man is bounde to iudge by charity.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, because the denomination followes the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part, as the soule beares the appellation of the whole man. Fifthly, to teach the marke that they that liue in the Church must aime at, and striue too, namely, to bee holy.</p>

                     <p>First, it is a barre and bridle to rash iudgement. Secondly, it is a spurre to quicken Christians to all care, to passe beyond reptobates, in the practise of Christianity, that they may get a sure testimony of their owne predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.

                     <p>Very true: therefore the Apostle very wisely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it, not by his owne testimony and report, but by the Prophets, and bringeth in God, speaking by the Prophets, to stop their mouthes the better, that they should haue no euasion.</p>

                     <p>But this place of Osee, is directly spoken for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Iewes; howe doth Paul draw it to the calling of the Gentiles?</p>

                        <hi>Paul</hi> being directed by the Holy Ghost, could not erre in his allegation. Secondly, though the Prophet speake it of the Iewes, dispersed for their Idolatry, telling them that GOD would gather them againe; which was done both temporally at their returned from their captiuity of Babilon; and spiritually by the preaching of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: yet the Gentiles are meant also, as deseruing proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to bee called (not a people,) being strangers from the couenant; whereas the Iewes became not Gods people accidentally, through their Apostacy, impiety, and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Therefore if God would conuert those back sliding Israelites, why not the Gentiles also? both being equally not Gods people though in diuers manners. Further the case stands thus; Osee diuides the whole worlde into two sorts, one which were his people hauing obtained mercy, another which were not his people nor pittied; he prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth of the former, that they should be made not a people, and bee without mercy for a time: the other shoulde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a people and obtaine mercy; and who can these bee but the Gentiles, to whome therfore <hi>Paul</hi> fitly applies that prediction?</p>

Ephe.<note place="margin">By scripture</note> 2, 1, 2. Secondly, reason proueth it. First, because in<note place="margin">By reason.</note> this estate we are without God and all manner of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Secondly, we are slaues vnto Sathan, subiect vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all euill, sin, and misery. Thirdly, the comparisons of Scripture not illustrate alone, but proue this truth; for we are compared to such as sitte in darknesse, and in the shadow of death, Acts, 26, 18. to Birds in snares, 2. Tim. 2, 26. to prisoners in fetters, to captiues in the handes of cruell enemies, Luke, 4, 18. to a childe newly and naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly borne, Ezek. 16. to persons deade and rotten in the graue, Iohn, 5, 25. to an house built vpon the sand, Math, 7, 26. to Thistles, Mat. 7, 16. to winter, Cant. 2, 11.

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, it serues to humble the godly by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance<note place="margin">Vse.</note> of their olde estate, that they were once in this dreadfull and vile condition. Secondly, it serues to make them thankfull with comfort, that they are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered and set free, Psal 103, 1, 2. 3. beeing so farre vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of grace. Thirdly, it serues to stirre vp others to praise God for such Christians as they see to bee freed from that woefull estate, after the example of <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 6, 16. and almost in the beginning of all his Epistles. Fourthly, it serues to confute al such (whether Pelagians or Papists) which doe ascribe the least power to a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man, eyther to thinke well or to merite ought with
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:20835:366"/>
Cod; for what good eyther will or worke can be in such as be neyther beloued nor people, til Christ cal &amp; change them? Lastly, heere is a warning to all such as doe not finde themselues truely called, to make haste out of this dolefull estate, giuing their eyes no slumber, nor rest to their eyelids, till they find rest to their soules.</p>

                     <p>First, by Scripture, Psal. 144, 15. Blessed are<note place="margin">Proofe.</note> the people whose God is the Lord. Iohn, 1, 12. To them that beleeue in him, there is giuen this dignity, to bee called the sonnes of God, 1. Iohn, 3, 1. Secondly by<note place="margin">Reason.</note> by reason; for first Gods children are Christs brethren, Heb. 2, 12. and Gods heires, Rom. 8, 18. Secondly, they haue their sinnes fully forgiuen them, Rom. 4 4, 5. Psal. 32, 1. Thirdly, they haue the blessing of beleeuing harts. Luke 1. Fourthly, they are led by the Spirite of sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which fils them with the feare of God, and godly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse of life, Psal. 112, 1. and 119, 1. Rom. 8, 9. Fift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if crosses and troubles come, they are supported and comforted vnder them, and reape much good by them, Iohn 14, Rom. 8, 28. Sixtly, the Angels are their ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, Heb. 1, 14. and all creatures are at league with them, Hosea, 2, 18. Seauenthly, they are freed from the power of sinne, Diuell, death, and hell, and all their enemies, Luke, 1. 74. Rom. 6, 7. Acts, 26, 26. Thirdly, comparisons of Scripture proueth this point; as of a tree standing by the Riuers of waters, planted in Gods house, set vpon a Rocke; of a Prince and a king full of riches &amp; glory; of an Oliue, and of a Vine, Psal. 45, and 92, 12, 13, Mat, 7, 24, Iohn 15.

                     <p>First, it reproues such as speake basely of Gods children. Secondly, it warneth vs of the great danger of such as offer them any wrong in word or deed; also what blessings are ouer their heades which kindely entreate them. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 42. and 25, 40. Thirdly, it exhorteth Gods children by remembrance of their great dignity, to beare the crosse patiently, to flye sin carefully, to liue holily and iustly. And lastly, it must encrease and double the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the faithfull, who bee by grace set in such an happy estate.</p>

                     <p>That the Ministers of Christ must boldly and distinctly declare the minde of God, Esay 58, 1. Hence is <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> called a crier, Math. 3, 3. It is a speech borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed from common criers in Cities, who so speak as they may be heard of all. Thus Christ spake, for he lift vp his voice, Iohn 7, 37. The reasons heereof be, first, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, Esay 58. Secondly, the example of Christ and the Prophets, Iohn 7. Thirdly, this maner of teaching stirres vp and quickens attention. Fourthly, it helpes the vnderstanding, causing things sooner to bee vnderstood and perceiued. Fiftly, the vntoward rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mans heart, requires such plainnesse and earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to humble and tame it.</p>

But the Prophet hath yet a further relation, (namely) vnto the times of Grace, when the greatest number of the Iewes spurned against the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, some few onely receyuing it.

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That though the Nation of the Iewes were full of people, yet the greatest number of them shoulde not be deliuered from eternal destruction. The reasons here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of bee, first their generall vnkindnesse and vnthankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse deseruing it. Rom. 10, 21. also verse 2. Secondly, God had decreed to call and saue but a few of them; as
<pb n="742" facs="tcp:20835:368"/>
appcareth by the latter part of this prophesie, verse 28. For to make his account, and gather it into a short sum, signifies not onely that God would lessen the number of the Iewes, but that he did it out of his foreappointment, his election and reprobation bearing the whole sway &amp; stroake in this thing. For more could not bee called and saued then were elected, and these were not many.</p>

                     <p>First, that eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the visible Church al are not elect, yea that the reprobates do in number exceede the elect. Secondly, that we must not bee offended with the few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the godly, and great heapes of the vngodly, for such was the estate of Gods people vnder the law. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it teacheth, that multitudes be no markes of the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church: in all societies for the most part, the best number is the least, and the greatest the worst.</p>

                     <p>First, that Gods elect bee a precious people, as the seede Corne is the best graine, 1 Pet 2, 9. which must engender in them a loue and comfort of theyr excellent estate euen vnder the Crosse; and in others a reuerence towards them, and it condemnes the world which iudge basely of them. Secondly, we learne that the godlie are exceeding fruitfull, as seede bringes forth some thirtie, some sixty, some an hundred folde: a sew Apostles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted whole nations to Christ, Acts 2, 41. Colos. 1, 7, 8. Rom. 1. Thirdly, the number of the elect, is the smallest number. It is verie great considered simply, Reuel: 7, 9. but small in respect of the damned, Luke 12, 32.</p>

his owne absolute will, and most free mercy. Thirdly, he had declared the ends of Gods predestination, the glorye of his mercy, in sauing of the one, and of his power and iustice, in destroying the other. Fourthly, hee had declared that the meanes to iudge of our election is by our effectuall calling. Lastly, that men may discerne when their calling is effectuall or not, (by faith or vnbeleefe) which are those two meanes whereby that high counsell of God is executed, as in this text is plainely to bee seene in the examples of faithfull Gentiles saued, and vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Iewes confounded.</p>

Secondly, the Iewes followed after righteousnesse, but found it not; the reason, because they beleeued not in Christ, but would be righteous by their owne workes, verse 31, 32.</p>

                     <p>They neither loued nor cared for, nor practised iust and righteous workes. This may appeare first, in that they could not, because they were ignorant of Moses law, much more ignorant were they of the righteousnesse of Christ. Secondly, as for the law of nature, they were also transgressours of that, being both lewde liuers, and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 20. 21. 22. &amp;c. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2. 1. 2. also chapter 4. 18. 19. &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>True, if we respect the outward discipline and gouernment of the common wealth; for they commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and rewarded many vertues, they forbad and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed many vices, as theft, murder, adultery, &amp;c. but ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their priuate life, they were for the most part very vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and enemies to all honesty, resisting Christ his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and Apostles. And this is that which is meant here (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen more then is sayed) that they followed not, that is, they fledde from it and abhorred it, and stroue against it.</p>

                     <p>First, wee learne that all men before grace are<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> vnrighteous, and thereby guilty of wrath. Secondly, that in mans will naturally, there can be no power to moue him to that which is good, for it carries him directly to that which is against the law, much lesse can men before grace merite <hi>excongrue.</hi> Thirdly, that faith (touching the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning

of it) is in no wise fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man himselfe, for it is giuen: for we can make ourselues no more able to beleeue, then wee can make ourselues to liue: for wee liue to God by saith, and till then wee are dead. Lastly, from hence wee learne that predestination is a most powerfull thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it brings to a calling, to faith, to Christ, and to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, euen those which thinke vpon nothing lesse, nay euen those which doe striue against it; as these Gentiles here na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and the theefe on the Crosse, and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Manas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and innumerable others.</p>

                     <p>It teacheth vs that neyther willing nor running, purpose nor endeauour, can get a man to bee a beleeuer: though men must doe their parts, yet all depends vpon the grace of God, which wee see euen without any labour conferreth grace and righteousnesse, there where God pleaseth to giue it.

                     <p>That perfect iustice of Christ, which hee wrought in his owne person, by his owne sufferings and doings, which consistes in remission of sinnes, and imputation of his obedience. See Rom. 3.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>But is not this absurd, that the Gentiles which were vnrighteous should receiue righteousnesse?</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>No, because they had faith to receiue Christ, who is the end of the law for righteousnesse, to all that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in him, Rom. 10, 4.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Very well, the righteousnesse of faith may bee found in him who wants the righteousnesse of workes: howbeit when the righteousnesse of faith comes, a mans owne vnrighteousnesse is done away, as touching the guilt of it; and the Spirit begins a righteous life in them, that they may in some measure thinke and do righteous things.</p>

                     <p>That the righteousnesse of Christ, and the gift of faith, doe differ the one from the other; for faith is wrought in vs by Gods guift, as a hand to take it, the righteousnesse of Christ stickes in his owne person as in the subiect, purchased by his death and obedience. Also this is perfect appeasing Gods wrath, the other is vnper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect needing Gods pardon. Secondly, from hence wee<note place="margin">2.

Thirdly, we learne that the iustice whereby we are righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous before God, is no inherent quality in our selues, because it comes from without vs, namely from Christs obedience imputed to faith; faith finds none in vs, but borrowes of Christ.</p>

                     <p>Indeede it is strange, euen a Paradox to naturall reason, but the cause will appear to be, that they sought amisse: as men may pray and not obtaine, because they pray amisse; so men may follow righteousnesse, and yet not get it, if they seeke it amisse.</p>

                     <p>Because the Law sets forth such a righteousnesse as no meere man is able to performe. It is certaine, could any man performe the Law perfectly, it would make him righteous and giue him eternall life, as it written; <hi>Doe this and liue,</hi> Gal. 3, 12. Leuit. 18, 8. but this absolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the Lawe, can no flesh attaine vnto, no not Gods owne regenerate Children when they are at the best; for if <hi>We say we haue no sinne, we are Lyars,</hi> 1 Iohn 1, 10. There is an impossibiltiy of keeping those two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, to loue with all the heart, and not to lust. Hence it is, that men easily misse of that righteousnesse, which yet they may much sweat for, and take exceeding
<pb n="750" facs="tcp:20835:372"/>
paines to haue it againe. There is yet another cause why they may misse of it, although they labour much for it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause none can seeke to bee saued by their owne workes, without contempt of Christ, in whome alone true righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse is to bee founde; for if one doe but once thinke that he may bee saued by his owne doings, it argues that that man doth iudge himselfe to stand in no need of Christs doings and sufferings, and so he makes the death of Christ voyd and frustrate. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 21.</p>

These are vnder a double misery; first, that they neuer get the righteousnes that they striue for; and besides that, they loose that true and perfect righteousnes of Christ. Secondly, it confutes the Papists who teach the keeping of the law to bee possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for then were righteousnesse to bee attained by our doing the law. Thirdly, it humbles the godly to consider that how many or good soeuer their workes bee, yet they come farre short of righteousnesse, and therfore they must be forced to say; <hi>Lord enter not into iudgement with thy ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant, for no flesh is righteous in thy sight.

                     <p>Yes verily, both for the commandement sake that<note place="margin">Solution.</note> bids them striue, and for the promise sake which is made to seekers and knockers. Thirdly, because this is enough to condemne a man, if he saile of doing his owne part in procuring his owne saluation. And lastly, because God doeth not vsually bestowe his grace and Spirite vpon the secure, snorting and idle, but vpon the painfull and carefull Christian; as hee giues, his earthly blessing to the diligent hand, and not to the slothfull. Notwithstanding all this, God is not mooued by any thing that wee doe to call and iustifie vs; but it is onely out of his owne good pleasure and mercy: and therefore none haue cause to glory or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce, saue onely in this, that they knowe him to bee their mercifull Father, <hi>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That the onely way to finde righteousnesse, is to seeke it by faith: the reasons be; first the commandement of God. Secondly his promise, <hi>The iust shall liue by faith, Rom.</hi> 1, 17. Thirdly, because the perfect righteousnesse of the law is not to bee found out of Christ, and hee is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise to be had then by faith, by which he dwels in our hearts, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 3, 17. Fourthly, no man can liue and doe so righteously, but that hee must neede remission of sinnes, because there still will bee some thing vnperfect; and all Scriptures teach that forgiuenesse of sin is not to bee had, but by faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 10, 43. Therefore faith onely is that which iustifies the elect sinners before God, as charity doth sit before men.</p>

by Faith onely, directly or indirectly, saying it is too much taught, &amp; that the reaching of it doth much hurt: these be ignorant speeches. Secondly, it teacheth vs the high and ready way how to seeke righteousnesse, (namely) by beleeuing, that wee are vnrighteous in our selues, and no righteousnesse to be found but in Christ, and in comparison of him, to iudge all our workes to be dung, Phil. 3, 8. That therefore euery Christians dutie is as he desi es to be righteous and to be saued, that he get this precious gift of faith, without the which, no Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation nor life can be had.</p>

                     <p>That our owne workes do not merit righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse<note place="margin">4. Doctrine.</note> and eternal life. This is true, as well of those works which are done of grace, as those which are done of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall<note place="margin">Reason.</note> strength. For of all workes the Apostle affirmes, that hee that seekes righteousnesse by them, can neuer haue it. Againe, euen these Iewes did not diuide works from grace: as in the example of the Pharisie, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth his workes to come of Gods grace, and yet could not be iustified by his owne workes. For sinners are first iustified, before they can do any thing pleasing to God. Good workes follow a person already iustified, but they go not afore as cause of iustification.</p>

to them a stone to stumble at, that is, they were offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at him, therefore they woulde not beleeue in him, but wilfully refused him, and crucified him as an euil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.

                     <p>God indeed had set Christ, to be the rising and fall of many, Luke, 2, 34. A stone precious to such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, but a rocke of offence to disobedient ones, 1. Pet.
<pb n="757" facs="tcp:20835:375"/>
2, 6. But this is to bee imputed to the wickednesse of men, who turne to their destruction, that which might haue been to their wealth; howbeit this is certaine that howsoeuer God delight not in the stumbling and vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe of reprobates, (as their contumacy is a sinne,) yet as it is a punishment of former sinnes, and a meane to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest his iustice, he hath willed and determined it.</p>

                     <p>That vnbeleeuers are in a most miserable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, because they refuse Christ, out of whom nothing is to be lookt for, but confusion and death eternall. Secondly, that most happye are such as haue founde mercy to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, because they shall enioy the thing in which they doe beleeue, and therefore shall not be put to confusion. Whereas such as through vnbeleefe make hast to be ius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by their owne merites, shall misse of true righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, whereof will follow extreame confusion. Men which run headlongly without looking what is in their way, doe stumble and take harme, yea sometime to their vndooing. So it fareth with all vnbeleeuing persons. which hasten vnto saluation by their owne running and working, not thinking of Christ, to become righteous through faith in him, they doe misse of that they shotte and aymed at, and meete with extreame confusion. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, once for all I note it, that in the disputation of righteousnesse by works, or by faith, heere in the end of this Chapter, and in the beginning of the next, as in ver. 3. and in the 3, 4, 5. Chapters of this Epistle, it is at any<note place="margin">Note.</note> hand to be taken heed of, that wee vnderstand no other faith but that which worketh by charity, Gal. 5. which purifieth the heart, Acts 15, 9. which hath vertue and godlinesse ioyned with it, 2. Pet. 1, 6, 7. which hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for a necessary companion and fruite, Acts, 20. 21. which is shewed by works, Iames, 2, 18. For though wee teach that onely faith iustifieth, yet this iustifying saith is not alone, but as a Queene, is attended with a traine of Christian graces. As I obserue this in behalfe of the Papists, which falsly charge vs to set foorth to the
<pb n="759" facs="tcp:20835:376"/>
people in our bookes and Sermons, a bare, barren, idle, and dead faith; so in regard of certaine other Heriticks, <hi>Seruetus</hi> executed at <hi>Geneua,</hi> and <hi>Sorinus,</hi> and <hi>Harminius, Bertius,</hi> who of late troubled the Churches in <hi>Holland &amp; Zeland.</hi> I further note that wee eschue (as a Shelfe or Rocke) their dangerous (if not blasphemous) conceite, that faith properly taken, or the act and worke of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, doth iustifie vs, and is accounted to the beleeuer for perfect righteousnesse with God, as if in his owne person he had done the law fully: which erronious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite crosseth the exposition of all Christian Churches and Diuines, expounding this proposition (we are iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith) figuratiuely. (Faith, by a Metonimie or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talepsis, put for the obiect Christ applied by faith) and all those plaine Scriptures which say, the obedience of one man made vs righteous, Rom. 5, 19. and, Christ is made to vs of God righteousnesse, 1. Cor. 1, 30. and, wee are made the righteousnesse of God in him, (not in vs, in our faith) 2. Cor. 5, 21. and Christ the end of Law (not faith) for righteousnesse, Rom. 10, 4. And fighteth also with such texts as make equipollent these propositions, a man is iustified by faith, and a man is iustified by the blood of Christ, by the redemption of Christ, Rom. 3, 23, 24, 25. Lastly it is repugnant to all sound reason; for faith (or to beleeue) it is a worke, and all works vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersally (both of Law and Gospell) bee excluded from iustification (as works:) also it is but one part of legall iustice to beleeue God, <hi>ergo</hi> not our whole iustice; yea it is vnperfect &amp; contaminated with ignorance, doubting, &amp;c. How then can it absolue vs before the most iuste Iudge?</p>

                     <p>Yea, very iust: For in the former precedent Chapter he had prooued that the promises of grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed not generally to the Iewes, beeing the most part of them reprobates; and had saide that they stumbled at the stumbling stone, verse 33. In this Chapter he takes from them all praise of righteousnesse by the workes of the law, (which were two things they much boasted of, the promises and the lawe,) also hee directly speakes of their reiection from God. Now least the Iewes should ascribe these discourses vnto <hi>Pauls</hi> hatred of their Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so become vnwilling to entertaine his doctrine, therefore it seemed very behoouefull hee should testifie his good will towards them, and to pacifie their mindes that they be not exasperated with such sharpe and harsh things as the Apostle wrote of.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That the Ministers of Christ are so to speake<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> truth, as they be carefull to doe it, out of louing affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and the hearers ought to haue a good perswasion of their teachers good will towards them. The reasons<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> heereof be: First, if all Christians must reprooue out of loue, much more the Ministers of the Gospell; because it behooueth them to excell in all graces, for example sake.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Spirite of the Gospell is a Spirite of loue and compassion, and the Ministers ought to be led with this Spirite.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, reproofes will hardly or not at all profite them, when the teachers loue is suspected, and his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hated. Lastly, it is a very good preparation for the
<pb n="761" facs="tcp:20835:377"/>
hearers to be forestalled and possessed with a good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Teachers good will towards them, as Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by sweetning bitter potions, make the patient the willinger to take it. And Rhetoritians being to speake of vnpleasant things, wila first mollifie their mindes, and win their good will by some artificiall insinuation: so ought Preachers to do much more as occasion and cause requires, by how much it imports him and his flocke, the more that his hearers thinke well of him. And if the Scorpion will first lay fast holde on them with his claw, whom he purposeth to strike with his tayle, then ought much more they to imbrace them by loue, whome they must cure by reproofe.</p>

                     <p>It teacheth that Ministers haue neede of great<note place="margin">Vses.</note> wisedome to discerne their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and that also which they teach, that they may know what it is that is likely to giue offence, also when to vse friendly admonitions and sharpe reprehensions. Secondly, it teacheth that Ministers ought to be endowed with a spirit of singular loue, and to expresse good will euen to such as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary minded, so long as there is any hope for to winne them.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, that they ought to haue an vpright heart, that in shewing loue and preuenting offence, they may not conceale any truth, or smoothe any vice, out of flattery and desire to please man.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, heere is a reprchension to such as will bee Ministers, and yet altogether lacke these graces, as if a lame man would attempt to runne, and a blinde man to take vpon him to be a guide.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, heere is an admonition to all hearers, to striue in themselues against all suspition, that their teachers exhorte and reprooue out of hatred of them; as they would euer desire to take any profite by their labours. For wee are verye apte to mistrust, and Sathan by his

                     <p>That in all the prayers which wee make to God<note place="margin">2. Doctrine.</note> for our selues or others, the desire of the heart must goe before. The reasons heereof bee these: First, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandemenr<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> of God, Prou. 23, 26. <hi>My sonne giue mee thy heart.</hi> Secondly, the nature of God, who being a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, will bee worshipped spiritually, with the desire of the heart, Iohn, 4, 24. Thirdly, this is the very cheefe thing in prayer, Psal. 25, 1. Marke, 11, 24. Fourthly, without this, prayer cannot be feruent and vnfained, and therefore cannot be heard. For the promise is made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to feruent prayers, Iames, 5, 15. Marke, 11, 24. Lastly,
<pb n="763" facs="tcp:20835:378"/>
such prayers as come from hearty desires, are onely plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and acceptable to God, and they onely testifie that we haue the Spirit of God, Rom. 8, 26, 27.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>By the due and godly meditation, First of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the thinges we pray for. Secondly, of the necessity, in that we cannot be happy if wee be without them. Thirdly, of our greeuous sinnes, which deserue things quite contrary to the things we doe pray for.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It teacheth that the thing cheefest in prayer, is,<note place="margin">Vses.</note> that the heart be set on work in sending vp good desires towards heauen, as sparkles out of a furnace. Secondly, it sheweth the true cause why that many prayers of the godly speed not, euen for that their desires are cold and faint, and slender. Thirdly, it warneth that the prayers of the wicked are but bablings, (vaine &amp; abhominable,) because they call on God with their lippes, the desire of their heart being farre from him, Mat. 15, 8. Lastly, the distinction of mental and vocall prayer is iustified by this place, and indeede no distinction in diuinity is currant but that which hath ground in the Scripture directly, or by good deduction.</p>

                     <p>That our Christian loue one towards another, doth no way more firmely manifest it selfe, then by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one for anothers saluation. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> proues the truth and earnestnesse of his loue to the Istaelites by this duty of praying for their conuersion to Christ, that they might be saued. Which shewes it to be a speciall eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of loue: yea <hi>Paul</hi> did more demonstrate his loue in praying for the Israelites good, then when hee gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for their euill; because it is more to bee saued, then to be deliuered from paine. Also <hi>Steuen</hi> at his death witnessed his charity by his supplication vnto God for
<pb n="764" facs="tcp:20835:379"/>
his persecutors, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 60. And Christ also manifested his deepe loue to his crucifiers, by praying God to forgiue them. Moreouer, <hi>Paul</hi> testified his loue to all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, in the beginning of his Epistles, by thanksgiuing and prayer for their faith and loue; and it cannot be but a man must loue him hartily, for whose repentance and saluation, he heartily prayeth.</p>

                     <p>First, to reproue them for want of loue, which foreslow or forget to pray for others, or do it not for their being saued. Secondly, to consute them of errour, who thinke loue to consist onely or chiefly in good speech or almes, or other outward woorkes of mercy to the body. Thirdly, here is an admonition to euery one, to proue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himselfe, the trueth of his Christian loue, by his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentand earnest prayers for the good of others: namely, for their conuersion and saluation, which is the chiefest good. For whosoeuer he be that truely loues another, doth euer aime at the good of the party loued, and especially of that which may doe them most good; and that what can it else be, but the saluation of their soules after <hi>Pauls</hi> exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple here?</p>

                     <p>No: these words set forth not the effect, and what fruite came of his prayer, but what scope and end he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to his prayer; which was not earthly and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but eternall good things.</p>

                     <p>All were not so, and for the other he might pray, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 1. Secondly, the nation of the Iewes were not cast out for euer, but for a time; and therefore hee might pray for the saluation of such as were to be called, <hi>Rom,</hi> 11. 25. This admonisheth all Christians, what things in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they ought especially to begge for others; and that the
<pb n="765" facs="tcp:20835:379"/>
euent of their prayers, euen for the most exellent good, which euer endures, doeth depend vppon Gods pleasure; whereof sithence wee can take no certaine knowledge, in respect of particular persons, therefore out of Christian charity, wee are to wish well to all whome God vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feth the name of his people; or with this limitation, (all whome God hath giuen to Christ.)<note place="margin">Iohn 17, 9.</note>

                     <p>Three; first, a thing must bee vehemently loued, for zeale is loue encreased. Secondly, a wrong (true or supposed,) is to be offered to the thing so feruently loued. Thirdly, thereupon ariseth a great griefe conceiued, with a desire to repell the wrong. This affection of zeale in it selfe is not good or euil, but is an indifferent affection, and many times it is found in men both good and euill; for the Apostles were zealous, and so were the Pharises; Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were zealous, and so were the Iewes too; as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in this Text: as now some Protestants in their way be zealous, so be many Papists.</p>

Secondly, the wrong which they thought to be done to God by the gospel of Christ was but supposed, and no true reall wrong.

                     <p>We learne first by <hi>Pauls</hi> example, to loue &amp; allow<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> of the good things which we finde euen in bad men, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be ioyned with much sin and wickednesse. For the zeale which the Iewes had to God (albeit it had no knowledge to guide it) yet seeing in it selfe it was a good thing, the Apostle commends it, and beares witnes to it. Christ also loued the good things which he saw in the couetous yong man that trusted in his riches, Marke 10, 21. also the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> praised many good things in <hi>Saul,</hi> 2 Sam. 1, 23. though he were a most wicked man. The Reasons heereof be, first because euery good thing,<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> (so farre as is good) comes of God, Iames 1, 17. &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must bee loued and liked. Secondly, this is a good meanes to cherrish concord and friendship among men, and the contrary stirres vp strife and hatred.

                     <p>First, it greatly loueth nothing but that which ought to bee loued. Secondly, it greeueth for wrong truely and indeede done to the thing it loueth. Thirdly, it neither exceedeth the bounds of calling and charitie. Fourthly, it euer affecteth and seeketh the honour of God, and not selfe-praise and vaine-glory, and opinion or applause of man. Examples of this true zeale we haue in Christ, when he whipt the buyers and sellers out of the Temple, Iohn 2, 15. and of <hi>Phineas,</hi> when hee thrust tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough both the Adulterers, euen as they were in their vncleannesse, Numb. 25, 8, 11. and of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> when they rent their cloathes, Actes 14, 19. and <hi>Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> when hee broake the Tables, Exod. 32. and <hi>Paul</hi> for the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 1 Cor. 1, 11. and for the Galathians, Gal. 4, 19.</p>

For, besides the Iewes named in this Text, wee haue the examples of diuers other in Scripture, as <hi>Demetrius</hi> his zeale for <hi>Diana,</hi> whom hee ought not to haue loued, Actes 19. <hi>Iehu</hi> was zealous, but fayled in the manner, 2 Kinges 10, 6. <hi>Paul</hi> a Pharisie was zealous, but hee lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that which hee should not haue loued, (that is,) his owne righteousnesse, as the Iewes did heere: and hee thoght Gods glory to be wronged by that by which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede it was not wronged, but honoured rather, as the Doctrine of grace and righteousnesse by Faith, Actes 22, 15. Thus the Pharisies and manie of the Iewes, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended in their zeale. Also the Apostles wishing Fire vpon a Towne in <hi>Samaria,</hi> fayled in the ende of theyr<note place="margin">Luke 9, 34, 35</note> zeale, which was onelie to ease their impatient minde, and not out of a pure affection to Gods glorie, nor out of charity to their neighbor.</p>

                     <p>It admonisheth all to labour for zeale, but (as they desire not to sinne and offend God in their zeale) to rule it acording to knowledge. There are three sorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that do offend about zeale, and are therefore to bee reprooued: First, such as be starke cold, hauing no zeale at all for Gods worship, doctrine, and glory. What be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of these things, they are no whit moued, so they may enioy their worldly pleasures and profits: such an one was <hi>Gallio,</hi> Acts 18, 17. The second sort be lukewarm and indifferent ones, neither hot nor cold, as the <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceans,</hi> Reuel. 3, 15. and the <hi>Israelites</hi> halting between two, 1 Kings 18, 21. The third sort are they, whose zeale is blinde, voide of knowledge, and godly wisedom, being rash and intemperate in their actions, couering their owne carnall affections with the cloake and pretence of glorifying God; yea too too many bee hot in publicke reformation, and yet be vnreformed priuately &amp; in their owne persons, being no Disciplinarians at home; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do much hurt to the name and Gospel of Christ, and giue great scandall to the Church of God, whilest they leap without the bounds of their vocation and all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian duty and discretion, whereof this age and Church of ours affoords vs many lamentable examples, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Separists. Therefore, as it behooueth all Christians to be zealous (zeale being commanded of God, Reuel. 3, 19. it being commended as a good thing, Galat. 4, 18. and as a fruite of repentance, 2 Cor. 7, 11. and as a part of Christes Image, Iohn 2, 17.) yet let all men striue by earnest prayer, to get godly knowledge ioyned to their zeale, to go before it as a guide to conduct it, and as an eye to direct it, both in the things to be loued, and in the manner and scope of their loue.</p>

                     <p>That a good intention is not sufficient to make ones action to bee good.

The reason heereof is, because a mans intention is neuer good, but when it is built vpon a good warrant (to wit) the word of God, and referred to a right end namely, the praise of God.</p>

                     <p>By two reasons contained in this present text:<note place="margin">Method.</note> the first is this, That Christ is the end of the Lawe, for righteousnesse; but it is certaine that wee doe receiue Christ Iesus rather by beleeuing then by working. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee must seeke to bee iustified before God by faith and not by workes. Or thus, The lawe serueth to send vs vnto Christ, therefore we are iustified by beleeuing in
<pb n="777" facs="tcp:20835:385"/>
Christ, who is the end of the law by fulfilling it, and not by the workes of the lawe which wee doe. The other reason is taken from the property of the lawe, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth perfect keeping of it vnto righteousnesse &amp; life, verse 5. but the perfect keeping of the law, is vnpossible to vs, therefore wee cannot haue righteousnesse by the workes of the law, but by faith in Christ.

                     <p>By a preoccupation making answere to a secret<note place="margin">Coherence.</note> obiection of the Iewes, who might say and pleade that they sought for themselues no other righteousnesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that the law requireth, and that being the true righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, therefore they could not erre in their zeale for it. Againe, they being affraide to be excluded from this true righteousnesse, if they admitted Christ, therefore did not they imbrace him. Vnto this their obiection the Apostle answeres, that indeed the Iewes did not seek true righteousnes, because they contemned Christ, who is the end of the law for righteousnesse to beleeuers; and therefore they had no cause to feare the loosing of the righteousnesse of the law by cleauing to Christ, who is the end of it.

                     <p>This worde [End] hath foure significations in Scriptures: First, it signifieth determination or ending of a thing, as Mat. 24, 3. Secondly, it signifieth the mark whereunto any thing aimeth, as 1 Pet. 1, 9. Thirdly, it signifieth perfection or accomplishment, as Ro. 13. <hi>Loue is the end of the Lawe.</hi> Fourthly, that for whose sake or cause any thing is appointed. The word [<hi>End</hi>] in this text may well beare all these four significations: but the two last especially. For Christ hath determined the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Law for signification and practise: and the Morall Law for curse and extreame rigour. Also he is the marke at which the whole Old Testament (to wit, both Law &amp; Prophets) aymed; for they bare witnesse to Christ, Ro. 3, 21. Thirdly, Christ is that which is intended in the Law, and for which the Law is appointed. Lastly, hee is the perfection of the Law, inasmuch as he hath exactlie in euery point perfourmed it, bearing the punishment due to the breach, and yeelding due obedience.</p>

                     <p>First, in respect of his integrity and puritie of his Nature, being conceiued without sinne, Math. 1, 18. Luke 1, 35. Secondly, in respect of his life and actions, being wholly conformed to the absolute righteousnesse of the Law, 2 Cor. 5, 21. Thirdly, in respect of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he suffered, to make satisfaction vnto Gods Iustice for the breach of the Law, Col. 1, 20. To which may be added, that hee hath purged the Lawe from the corrupt glosses of the Pharisics, Math. ch. 5, 6. Lastly, he reneweth it, causing his members heere to beginne, and in heauen to fulfill the obedience of it, Tit. 3, 5. 6.</p>

Secondly, it teacheth, that true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian people be the onely happie men, and onely Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion to bee the onely true religion; because it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone teacheth the Doctrine of Christ, and of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse by him, therefore all other professions, besides Christianity, directly leades to perdition, whatsoeuer shewes they haue.

Therefore such are here iustly to be reprooued, as vpon hearing of the law preached, do sticke in the knowledge of their sinnes, and the feare of Gods wrath due to them; whereas they should be led for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="781" facs="tcp:20835:387"/>
thereby to see and seele a great need of Christ, that they may seeke after him to obtaine pardon of their sins, also righteousnesse and eternall life by him: as a man that is wounded, or one that is sicke, runnes to the Physition for reliefe and helpe, so the law reuealing sinne and death, should whip to Christ.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, it confuteth such as looke for eternall<note place="margin">Vse.</note> life by the workes of the Law, which indeede can mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster nothing but death to vs, sithence wee cannot keepe it. For as it promiseth life to the dooers, so it threatneth death to him that failes but in one point; and what man liuing is he that sinneth not?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it serueth to humble vs, in as much as by our owne fault we are made vnable to doe the works
<pb n="785" facs="tcp:20835:389"/>
of the law in that perfection that it requireth; for that it cannot giue vs righteousnesse and life, it must bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted<note place="margin">The law hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>-bleth vs by shewing what we ought to haue, and yet haue it not by our owne default, also it prouoketh by prayer to secke it.</note> to a weakenesse in our selues, and not to an insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in the lawe, Rom. 8, 3. Thirdly, it sendeth all men, euen the best, out of themselues, and enforceth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to goe to Christ for righteousnesse and life eternall, by beleeuing that he hath fulfilled the law for vs, by his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and death; and this is indeed the right medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the doctrine of the lawe, when it schooleth and swindgeth a sinner vnto Christ, to fetch from him alone righteousnesse and saluation. Now heereby shall wee know that the preaching of the righteousnesse of the law, hath driuen vs to Christ: First, if we trust not to the workes of the law, to seeke life by the merite thereof in whole or in part. Secondly, if wee striue to order our workes according to the leuell of the law, making it the rule of our Christian life, still suing to Christ, for pardon of faults. Lastly, learne hence, that if the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the law hauing promise of life, do consist in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thinges commanded, in all perfection; therefore Christ cannot be the end of the law for tighteousnes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse beside the passion of his death there be allowed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to beleeuers his actiue obedience and integrity of life, that in him wee may claime life, as well as escape death.</p>

                     <p>That <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle and <hi>Moses</hi> writings, had good agreement in the doctrine of the Gospell. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the righteousnesse of faith hath witnesse from the law and the Prophets.

                     <p>Why then is Moses accounted a Preacher of the<note place="margin">A doubt.</note> lawe, and set against the Apostles and Christ, the preachers of the Gospell? Iohn 1. 17.</p>

                        <hi>Moses</hi> had this denomination of that which hee did for the most part, and that was to publish and expound<note place="margin">

and yet refusing to beleeue in Christ, euen for that they thought therby to be drawn away from this <hi>Moses;</hi> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Paul</hi> tels them that there is no such matter, if they would beleeue <hi>Moses:</hi> but contrariwise they must receiue Christ, whome hee preached: as <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> so <hi>Moses</hi> prepared Disciples for Christ, the one more, the other lesse clearely.</p>

                     <p>But how may it appeare to vs, that Moses in this testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony<note place="margin">Doubt.</note> did speake of Christ and the Gospell?</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, out of <hi>Moses</hi> wordes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. 11. the<note place="margin">Solution.</note> promises of conuersion to God, and circumcision of the heart are parts of the Gospell; and this was the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, and not the legall precepts which that day hee spake. Secondly, out of <hi>Paul,</hi> who in this place tearmeth the word which <hi>Moses</hi> spake, to be the word of faith, verse 8. Thirdly, if <hi>Paul</hi> had vsed this text of <hi>Moses</hi> by allusion, agreement or proportion onely (as if such wordes as were spoken by <hi>Moses</hi> touching the law, might fitly be applied by <hi>Paul</hi> to the Gospell,) then had they not serued the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the Apostle; which was to confirme by testimony of <hi>Moses,</hi> that which hee had spoken before touching Christ, being the end of the law for righteousnesse to him that beleeues. They are then deceiued which think that <hi>Paul</hi> alludeth to <hi>Moses,</hi> citing him by way of consequence and not directly; or that he doth speake of the bare know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or performance of the law, either by natural stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth, or as it is made easie by grace: for then <hi>Paul</hi> shoulde not haue spoken of righteousnesse by faith, but of sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and newnes of life; which is quite besides his drift and scope, which is out of <hi>Moses</hi> to commend the righteousnes of faith, as is very plaine in the text.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, that they which sticke to their owne<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> workes, and thinke to be saued by their owne deseruings, they haue wauering and vnquiet consciences, troubled with doubtings, tremblings, and feare; for that which the righteousnesse of faith speaketh not, that the legall iustice doeth speake. The reason of this doctrine is, because the<note place="margin">Reason.</note> lawe which promiseth life to perfect obedience, giues no power to obey; it threatneth death against euery trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, but giues no remedy against any such euill and misery. Therefore it must needs be that such as follow the righteousnes of the law, must still be filled with anguish of Soule, because their conscience witnesses vnto them, that they haue not done all which the law commaunds, but are transgressours manifold wayes in many thinges, and so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine perplexed and without rest.</p>

                     <p>This sets foorth the miserable condition of all<note place="margin">Vse,</note> such as seeke righteousnes and life, by their owne deedes; for such can neuer haue any sounde ttanquility; well may they haue benummed dead consciences, but pacified con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, they cannot haue; because they alwayes lack what

The other how to escape hell and damnation. And these two doubtings are continuall and necessary effects of legall righteousnesse: for a man that hath not wholly kept the law, must needes doubt whether hee shall haue eternall life. For it is promised vpon no other condition but of exact and strict performance, and he who knoweth that he hath done things against the lawe, must needs bee in feare of damnation, because it is threatned vnto euery sinne.</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>Yea, namely this, that these doubtings are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> and repugnant to the nature and property of faith, whose property is to expell doubting, as heate expels coldnesse; as appeareth by <hi>Iames,</hi> which tels vs that faith forbids vs to wauer, Iames, 1, 6. and by the wordes of <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle, Rom. 4, 20, 21.</p>

                     <p>But how then comes it to passe, that beleeuers are often<note place="margin">Doubt.</note> troubled with doubtings?</p>

                     <p>This happens through the infirmity of their<note place="margin">Solution.</note> flesh and naturall weakenesse, which wrestles and striues with the assurance of faith, which though it be certaine and firme, yet it is not perfect and full. And from the imperfection of faith, there comes doubting, as Christ saith to his Apostles, <hi>Why doubt ye, o ye of little faith?</hi> For the hand shaketh through palsie, or some other weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, though the property of the hand be to holde fast: so of the weakenesse of faith ariseth doubting; but the property of faith is to breed affiance and confidence, and to driue away doubtings and feares, euen as the Sunne

Secondly, it confutes the Papists, who deny infallible assurance and certainty to bee the office of faith, and destroy the very nature of faith which is, to assure men. Thirdly, it warnes vs to detest doubting as a thing contrary to faith, and out of an hatred of it to fight against it. Fourthly, it exhorts all men to seeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter faith, by which alone they are able to get victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer doubtings; which may well assault faith, but must be ouercome by faith, 1.

For Faith doth beleeue and assent to all that which GOD speakes in the Scriptures; because they proceede and come from him who is the God of truth; al whose words are most true and faithfull: howbeit our Christian Faith doth more specially respect the word of the Gospel, the promise of Grace touching the remission of sinnes, and eternall life by Iesus Christ; as it is saide heere by way of exposition [<hi>This is the word of Faith which we preach.</hi>] And wheresoeuer wee finde Faith, and Christ his blood and death coupled together, wee are giuen to wit, that the Doctrine teaching Christ his person and office, is the proper obiect of our iustifying Faith, which is therefore by Diuines defined to bee an affiance in the promise of Grace.</p>

                     <p>Because that word alone doth offer vnto sinners<note place="margin">Reason.</note> the merits of Iesus Christ to bee freely enioyed of them vnto remission of sinnes and saluation, so as they be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced and receiued; and therefore they bee called the word of his grace, and the Gospel of Christ, &amp; the word of saluation and reconciliation: because both the free loue of God, and Christ, and al his benefits be propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the elect in the word of promise.</p>

His testimonies are sure and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for euer, Psal. 19, 7. 1 Iohn 2, 17. Also, Heauen and earth shall perish, but one tittle of Gods word shall not perish, and Rom. 9, 6. 2 Cor. 1, 20. 1 Cor. 1, 9. Now then, Faith it selfe must needs bee a thing vnmooueable, and bring with it an infallible certainty, sithence it leaneth on such a firme rocke, Mat. 7, 25. as the sure words of the faithfull promises of God, who neither is deceiued, nor can deceiue vs, seeing he cannot lye, Tit. 1, 2. but is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly truth, yea truth it selfe, Ro. 3, 3. Hence it is that (<hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rophorie</hi>) or full assurance is attributed to Faith in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Col. 2. 2. Hence also it is, that godly Christians, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then they will deny the doctrine of Christ, or anie part of it so ascertained vnto their vnderstanding, and with such firme assent of their mindes receiued, they choose to loose their liberties, liuings, yea and liues al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so, if the will of God bee: examples heereof, we haue in many thousand martyrs of Christ in all ages.</p>

                     <p>Why is confession set before faith, which is the<note place="margin">Doubt.</note> cause and roote of confession? Psalme 116. 10. I beleeued there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did I speake.</p>

                     <p>First, because <hi>Moses</hi> did in this order propound<note place="margin">Solution.</note> them, as in the 8. verse is cited.

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>First, because the faith of the resurrection of Christ,<note place="margin">Solution.</note> doth distingush Christians from Pagans and Infidels, who do easily accord to beleeue that the man Christ was born, liued, and dyed; but they deny his resurrection, as a thing which exceedeth compasse and reach of reason; the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers discerned it not, but derided it rather, saying What new doctrine is this, <hi>Acts</hi> 18. Secondly, because all that Christ did and suffered, had profited vs little, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse hee had risen againe, wherein hee obtained a perfect victory ouer sinne, death, hell, and damnation, for all the elect. Lastly, the article of the resurrection presupposeth al the rest, and knitteth together as a linke, both antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and consequents: his incarnation, life, and death which went before; and his ascension, sitting at his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers right hand, and his intercession which followes after his rising.

our righteousnesse before God, and saluation in heauen, there is no more difficult and hard thing exacted of vs, but with the heart to beleeue, and with the mouth to confesse Christ: and by this meanes, Christ will be neere to vs both in possibility and efficacy: in possibilitie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a thing possible which may bee, that elect sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners shall haue grace to beleeue, especially God hauing ordained them vnto Faith, Actes 13, 48. but it is vtterly vnpossible, that they should keepe the whole Law per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, Gods decree and mans corruption being against it. And secondly, hee is neere and easie to vs in efficacie, because through the holy Spirit, hee is made to dwell in a faithfull heart, really and actually; and his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse as a robe or garment, is put vppon them, to couer their sinnes and vnrighteousnesse.</p>

                     <p>Yea, but to beleeue in Christ, is no lesse impossible &amp; <note place="margin">Aidoubt.</note> hard, then to fulfill the Law: for we haue no more power to doe the one, then the other.</p>

                     <p>It is true: but this facility is to be vnderstoode,<note place="margin">Solution.</note> not in regarde of the beginning and efficient cause of Faith, which is meerely Gods gifte without our selues, he working in vs both will and deede, Ephes. 2, 10. Phil. 2, 13. but this righteousnesse of Faith is easier in regard of the manner of the worke, because the Law requireth the ful obedience thereof to be performed by our selues, which cannot be in this infirmity, Ro. 8, 3. But Faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth and sendeth vs to Christ for the perfourming of the Law; and in regard of the manner of the worke, it is farre easier to beleeue the Law to bee done by another, who was able to fulfill it, and was sent for that end, then to do it our selues. Also much easier it is, to beleeue and giue assent to a true promise, then to keep strictly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out failing all Gods commandements. If a King should say to a Subiect, Conquer mee such a kingdome. and I will giue thee my daughter with large dignities and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings; were it not harder then if he should say, doe but trust my word, and I will do all this for thee. In these
<pb n="800" facs="tcp:20835:397"/>
considerations one saith, that saluation hath but a short cut, it requireth no external labour, but inward beleefe: and <hi>Caluin</hi> saith that by the operation of the Spirit, thou maiest easily beleeue with thy heart, and confesse with thy mouth. And <hi>Lyranus</hi> saith, heere is shewed the faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the righteousnesse of faith. And <hi>Faius</hi> thinketh this saying, of being neere in the heart and mouth, to be a Prouerbiall speech, commending the readines of that which is in the heart and mouth.</p>

The thing here repeated is, that a Christian that beleeueth in Christ dead and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to life, and confesseth this his faith before men, shall certainly and without doubt be saued. Wherefore let vs<note place="margin">Method or disposition of the Text.</note> obserue these things, that faith and confession are cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled together, as the tree and her fruite, and as the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Daughter.

the mouth. Lastly, not the parts but the degrees of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation be pointed at. The first degree or beginning of it, is righteousnesse, to wit, absolution from sinne, by free pardon, through the merit of Christ his death, and<note place="margin">2.

Secondly, he particularly nameth both Iew and Gentile, which in respect 1. of saluation, 2. and the neede thereof by sinne, 3. with the meanes thereof by Faith, are equal, as he proueth by two Reasons: one from the vnity of Gods effence, who is the same Creator and<note place="margin">Iewes &amp; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles be equal, wherein and why.</note> Sauiour of all the elect, Iew and Gentile.

Therefore by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Gentiles, nought was taken from the Iewes; these were no whit endamaged by sauing them; God is sufficient for both.</p>

                     <p>First, it instructeth vs to know how necessarie Faith is: for where this is, there righteousnesse is; and there is no righteousnesse where Faith is wanting. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it conuieteth the Papists of greeuous slaunders, in that they charge <hi>Luther</hi> to be the first inuenter of this Doctrine touching righteousnes by Faith alone. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as<note place="margin">Quod primam, id verum: sal. sum quod poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim.</note> before him, the learned Doctors of the Church, yea, Apostles, Prophets, and Christ himselfe, had deliuered this truth to the Church, euen from the beginning.

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That the seate and subiect of Faith is not the minde alone, but the will also, which is more speciallie signified by heart, Acts 8, 37. Ephes. 3, 17. For this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence<note place="margin">Reason.</note> is at least a necessary companion of faith, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence hath place in the heart, therefore Faith lodgeth there also.</p>

                     <p>It serueth to teach, that vnto a liuely Faith, there<note place="margin">Vse.</note> is required a double worke of the Spirit: First, to enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the minde, that it may certainly see and assent to the things written in the Gospell. Of this first worke it is, that Faith is often in Scripture tearmed Vnderstanding,<note place="margin">Colos. 2, 2.</note> and knowledge, and seeing. The other worke is to bow<note place="margin">Iohn 17, 3.</note> the affections that they embrace, and fully rest in that<note place="margin">Iohn 6, 40.</note> which the minde hath fully assented vnto. From this<note place="margin">Ephes. 3, 12.</note> worke. Faith in Scripture is tearmed trust, confidence, and affiance. Secondly, this Doctrine serueth to confute the Romanists, which place Faith in the supernal part of the soule onely, and will haue it to bee nothing else but the assent of the minde to the will of God: whereas it is not written heere, that with the vnderstanding, but with the heart man beleeueth to righteousnesse. There may indeede bee worthy knowledge and notable assent in the vnderstanding part, but it is the heart which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth
<pb n="804" facs="tcp:20835:399"/>
to iustification. Thirdly, here is an exhortation to all Christians (as they will bee assured of this iustifying faith,) not to rest content with a naked knowledge of the Gospell, or that in their mindes they haue yeelded agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and consent to the trueth of it; but neerely to looke vnto this, whether faith haue taken holde of their will and affections, to make them obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to their illuminated vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, with some measure of peace and ioy; and to resist all contrary thoughts and motions, with a loathing of them, being ready to make confession of Christ in our mouthes.</p>

                     <p>That a liuely faith bringeth forth good workes,<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> and namely the consession and inuocation of Christ; which where they are, there is true faith, and there is no true faith where they bee not; as there is no fire where there is no light nor heat, for it is the nature of faith to witnesse it selfe vppon occasion, as fire sendeth forth heate. Therefore are wee wronged by the Papistes, who accuse vs to teach a weake and a dead faith voyde of workes: and Christians are to be warned to get such a faith as can shew it selfe by workes, and such workes as proceede from faith; for wee teach that true faith workes by loue, and all works which come not of faith, to be sinnes. Secondly, we learne that confession is a worke necessary to saluation, and is to bee done of all those that will be saued; necessarily, as a duty and a thing commanded vs of God, but not as a meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cause.</p>

                     <p>To proue by authority of Scripture, what<note place="margin">Scope.</note> he had said before in verse 10. where he ascribed righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse vnto faith, as to a cause; and saluation to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, as to a way which leadeth vnto saluation. The argument standeth thus: It is not possible that the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture should be broken and vntrue; but the Scripture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscth righteousnesse and saluation vnto such as truely beleeue and call upon Christ. This is proued by these three verses of our Text; touching faith, verse 11. tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching confession in verse 13. Therefore men doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue with the heart to righteousnesse, aud saluation pertaineth to such as confesse him.</p>

                     <p>These lessons: First, that the Scripture is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> not onely to teach al needfull truths of godlinesse, but to confirme and prooue it also. Secondly, that the word written, is the infallible rule of al doctrines, which are to bee deliuered vnto the Church, for direction of faith or manners, for in that <hi>Paul</hi> doth prooue and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish all doctrines of Christianity by the Scripture alone
<pb n="807" facs="tcp:20835:400"/>
(not vsing any other testimony for that end:) Thence it followes, that Scripture onely is the most certaine and vndeceiueable rule of all doctrines. The reasons heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of bee, first because God the author of all Scripture, is<note place="margin">Reason.</note> most perfect in knowledge, and of infinite wisedome; therefore his word must needs containe a perfect rule &amp; direction whereby to iudge of doctrines. Secondly, our faith springs from Scripture alone, Romanes 10, 17. Therefore wee must beeleeue that onely for sound doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which can be drawne from the word of God writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>

                     <p>First, it serues to admonish vs to try all things<note place="margin">Vse.</note> which is taught of any Ministers, by the touchstone of the Scriptures, as the Christians of <hi>Berea</hi> did, Acts, 17, 11. receiuing willingly what wee finde grounded vpon and consonant vnto the Scriptures, but refusing all that is diuerse from it. The ancient fathers and Doctours of the Church, nay the Apostles submitted their sermons and writings to this tryall, 1. Thes. 5, 21. 1. John, 4, 1, 2. As we like that Gold onely that will abide the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, so wee must holde onely such doctrines as agree with the word of God. Secondly, it confuteth the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists which make vnwritten traditions to be a rule equal to holy Scriptures; being indeed a leaden rule of deceit, vncertaine and subiect to change, and to falshoode and error; yet they will haue them imbraced with like reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and affection as the holy Bible.</p>

                     <p>Touching the manner, the Apostle doth so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge the place of Esay, as withal he doth interpret and expound it, which is the best manner of alleadging scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, so to cite them as to giue some light to them. For whereas Esay said (he) indefinitely, <hi>Paul</hi> writeth (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer)
<pb n="808" facs="tcp:20835:401"/>
vniuersally to shew vs, that an indefinite propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition is equipollent to an vniuersall. Secondly, <hi>Paul</hi> mentioneth the obiect of our faith (in him (that is) Christ,) whereas <hi>Esay</hi> saide onely hee which beleeueth. Thirdly, in <hi>Esay</hi> it is written (shall not make hast) in <hi>Paul</hi> shall not be ashamed, (that is, frustrate of his successe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceiued of that they looked for,) which is a fruite and consequent of hast: for such as are hasty and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitant, doc their businesse vntowardly, and naughtily; as <hi>Saul</hi> did when hee made hast to offer sacrifice before <hi>Samuel</hi> came, wherein hee did greatly sinne, and was thereby brought to shame. As also <hi>Peter</hi> his precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, caused shame to him; whereas the true beleeuers without such shame, shall obtaine forgiuenesse of sinne by Christ.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, that as the high cause, to wit, predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or election, is not restrained to the Iewes onely, but powred out vpon all sorts of men, as well as Iewes, Rom. 9, 29. so is faith (the next cause) equally giuen to all people, without difference of nation whatsoeuer. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the reason why many Iewes and others bee ashamed and confounded is, for that they beleeue not, because who-soeuer beleeueth, shall not bee ashamed. Thirdly, that the true iustifying faith hath no other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per obiect but Christ Iesus, and him as he is both dead &amp; quickened; this is that brazen Serpent towards which our faith looketh. Fourthly, that Christ is very true God, because we are bound to beleeue in him, see Iohn 14, 1. This confuteth the <hi>Arians</hi> denying Christs eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and naturall diuinity. Fiftly, that the vniuersality of the promises of the Gospell, are restrained and limited to beleeuers and to them also they be extended, and to euery one of them, and to none other; there is an vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sallity of beleeuers, as there is of vnbeleeuers.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>But the Iewes did appropriate the promises of God to<note place="margin">Doubt.</note>

                     <p>They did so, but vniustly; for now vnder the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell (howsoeuer before there was manifolde and great difference, see Rom. 3, 2. Also 9, 4, 5.) there is no distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but Iew and Gentile are al one. For first, they haue all neede of saluation, all being sinners, destitute of Gods grace, and of the gift of true righteousnesse, Esay 53, 6. Rom. 3, 23. Or if wee looke vnto the meritorious cause which is Christ, in him all haue like intrest by Gods mercy, Rom. 11, 32. or the meanes whereby to be made partakers of Christ (which is Faith) a guift bestowed by God indifferently vpon the Iewes and Gentiles, Gal. 3, 8. Ephes. 2, 17, 18.</p>

                     <p>Because hee is the common Creator of all, who made both Iew and Gentile. Secondly, because he is the iustifier of all, without respect of countrey, euerie one which beleeueth in Christ, shall haue righteousnesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; who is one which doth iustifie the circumcisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Faith, and the vncircumcision through faith, Rom. 3, 30. From whence it doth follow, that God accepteth not persons, Acts 10, 30. so as to loue one the more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is a Iew, or the lesse because he is a Gentile, but is of like affections to all the faithfull, of what people or language soeuer: as a Father is well affected vnto all his children which do well, and a workeman to all his work made by him: so is God good to all his people without distinction of place. Therefore a Gentile though not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised, yet if he haue faith, he shall become righteous and liue for euer: whereas an vnbeleeuing Iew shall be sent away vniustified, though he be circumcised.</p>

Secondly, God so loues his<note place="margin">2. Doctrine.</note> Children, as he is not onely (good) to them, but (rich) to them, and heapeth his grace vpon them. See Ephes. 2, 5.

This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease springeth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence, that they consider not that the goodnesse of God is bottomlesse, being such a fountain as can neuer be drawne dry, his riches being farre vnlike worldly riches, which are diminished by giuing.</p>

And heerein a secret obiection is answered; for our Apostle hauing soundly confirmed that our true righteousnesse before God, which bringeth peace to the soule, must be had not by working after the law, but by beleeuing the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall promises of forgiuenesse of sinnes and life eternall by Christ dead and raised, and that these promises equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong to Iew and Gentile: The next thing to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired was this, how we might ordinarily come vnto &amp; attaine this faith, and the righteousnesse which it layeth

So as this text of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scriptures doth very plainly and worthily commend to vs, the singular excellency, the great fruite and necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the worde preached, being the meanes ordained of God, to conuay into the heartes of elect Iewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, that most precious guist of faith, which receiueth Christ and his righteousnes vnto saluation in heauen.</p>

Thus, God by his Prophets promised saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on indifferently to Iewe and Gentile, but without calling on God or prayer, there is no saluation, and none can pray, without faith, and no faith without hearing, no hearing without a Preacher, no Preacher without commission or sending. Therefore it is necessary to all people for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning of saluation, that God send his Apostles and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ministers to preach the word. From the causes to the effects, the argument runneth thus affirmatiuely; it is by the free and merciful sending of God that men do preach, such as preach ought to bee heard, by hearing Gods word there commeth faith, faith bringeth prayer, prayer is a sure note of saluation: therefore God must send some to bee Preachers, that others may get saluation. Or thus; Gods sending causeth Preachers, preaching bringeth hearing, hearing breedes beleeuing; faith worketh prayer, prayer obtaines saluation. This serues to stay the Iewes from grudging against the Apostles, because the Gentiles being appointed of God to faith and saluation, must not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the meanes and helpes, by which God will saue his owne: therefore no cause to mislike the Apostles for prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the doctrine of Christ to the Gentiles.</p>

The reasons heereof be; first because it is written, he that<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> commeth to God must beleeue that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that seeke him, Heb. 11, 6. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because trust and confidence of the heart that God will heare, is that which begetteth prayer, whereof as of all other good guifts and good workes, liuely faith is the mother and roote whence they spring, fetching all their praise and vigor from faith; therefore it was, that <hi>Moses</hi> cryed for deliuerance from the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> &amp; <hi>Dauid</hi> from <hi>Saul</hi> and other enemies, &amp; the <hi>Syrophenissian</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for her daughters safety, &amp; the blind ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for his sight, and the Publican for the remission of his sinnes, &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they beleeued that God could and would grant their petitions. As we in our necessities when we need other men, do willingly become sutors for helpe at their hands, when we haue trust to bee heard and succoured: so it is the affiance of Gods goodnesse which doth bring foorth inuocation, and calling on his name, as <hi>Dauid</hi> said, Wee beleeue and therefore wee pray, Psal. 116.</p>

bring faith, hauing assurance of Gods loue in Christ, that for his sake he is our sather, and also will faithfully keepe his promises which he hath made to them that call vpon him. Secondly, to reprooue such as doe offer to pray, hauing their hearts voyd of this holy confidence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which all prayers bee vaine and idle. Thirdly, to comfort such as feele their hearts stirred vp to desire of Gods blessings, with a confidence to obtaine, because this is a certaine note that they haue faith, without the which they could not haue such desires and such confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Ephe. 3, 12. Fourthly, to conuict the Papists of error, for their calling vpon Saints departed, in whome because they may not put any trust, (for cursed is he that trusteth in man,) therefore no prayer ought to bee made to them, but to God alone, in whom alone it is that wee may put our confidence.

The Philosopher <hi>Aristotle</hi> calleth this the sence of vnderstanding, (<hi>sensus discipline</hi>) and <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it the sence of beleeuing, (<hi>sensus fidei,</hi>) Our other senses (especially our eyes) are good helpes of many notable thinges; for thereby wee reade in the
<pb n="817" facs="tcp:20835:405"/>
great booke of Gods creatures, wherein we beholde the glory of the Creator, his maruailous wisedome, his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall power and God-head, Psal. 19, 1, 2. 1. Cor. 2, 21. Rom. 1, 19, 20. Yea moreouer by our eyes wee reade in the word of God, and other good bookes made and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for increase of godly knowledge; sithence the sight of the creatures and workes of God is sufficient to leaue vs without excuse, Rom. 1, 20. but vnsufficient and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall to breed faith. And because reading belongs to a few, and hearing is common to all, therefore euen by <hi>Pauls</hi> owne testimony, it hath the preheminence, so as better it were to loose all our senses, then to misse this alone. Secondly, it sets foorth the miserable estate of popish Recusants, which stop their care like the Adder, and will not heare; also of Atheists, who thereby doe barre themselues of the meanes of faith and saluation. Thirdly, it exhorts vs to diligent hearing, with all care and conscience, to heare with our best attention, seeing faith is dropt in to vs by the eare. Fourthly, it reproues sleepy, drowsie, and carelesse hearers, who doe as it were shut out faith, that it should not enter. But let vs not looke that God will open our heart, except we keepe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen our eares. Fiftly and lastly, it is matter of great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort for wandring lost sinners to vnderstand that there is yet a way euen, by hearing the word, to recouer and saue themselues, &amp; therefore that they ought to liue in those Countries and places where they may bee partakers of hearing, and that they hearken vnto the sauing doctrine of the Gospell, with desire to vnderstand and obey it.</p>

                     <p>It must stay men from rash entering into so high and holy a vocation, before they haue fitnesse thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; which were a fearfull presumption.

Fourthly, it reprooues such as will continue Ministers, and yet are vnmeete for this duty of proclayming Gods word. Lastly, it warneth to lay hands hastily on no man, 1 Tim. 5, 22.</p>

                     <p>That vnto the hearing of the word, the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> of it is necessary, euen as hearing is necessary to faith and faith to prayer, and prayer to saluation, so it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie that there be preaching that men may heare. The
<pb n="819" facs="tcp:20835:406"/>
reason heereof is, because there is a relation or mutuall<note place="margin">Reason.</note> respect betweene the sence of hearing, and the obiect thereof, which is a sound or voice. We can hear nothing but a sound, and therefore there must be some to preach and teach that others may heare. Thus often times are preaching and hearing in Scripture set downe for Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relatiues. Secondly, it is the good pleasure of God now no otherwise to call his people to his kingdom, then by Preachers: therefore Preachers of the word are needful, for we cannot be saued, vnlesse we be called to the Faith of Christ; and there is no way to call vs, but eyther by God himselfe immediately, or by his Ministers mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but he hath ceased now to speake to vs immediately from himselfe. Therefore, if we will be saued, wee must heare Gods Ministers speake to vs out of his worde; and thus much we may gather from such Texts of Scripture, wherein the holy Ghost doth often ioyne preaching and beleeuing togither, as in Iohn 17, 20. Acts 8, 12. &amp; 14, 1. And moreouer it serueth to teach vs, that if we desire to beleeue and be saued, wee must attend preaching and hearing of Sermons: and this is the reason why GOD woulde neuer suffer his people in any age, to want out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vocation by his Ministers. <hi>Noah</hi> was a Preacher of righteousnesse, <hi>Abraham</hi> a Prophet. God gaue vnto the Iewes <hi>Moses</hi> his prophet, and after him the Priestes and Leuites, to teach <hi>Israel</hi> his Lawe, and extraordinarily raised vp many Prophets; and at last hee sent his Sonne, to declare his wil for the saluation of the world. He gaue moreouer some to be Apostles, Prophets, Euangelistes, and others, to be pastors and teachers to the end of the world, for the gathering of the Saints, Ephes: 4.</p>

<pb n="820" facs="tcp:20835:407"/>
is, namely, to saue vs by the word preached, 1. Cor. 1, 18. 1. Tim. 4, 16. How admirable and gracious is God, who can wrap such power in the voyce &amp; words of men, as shall kindle sauing faith in the hearts of the hearers? Stoope to this holy ordinance.</p>

                     <p>This teacheth how miserable that people is<note place="margin">Vse.</note> which want the ordinary preaching of the word, they must needes fall into the Ditches which haue none but blinde or carelesse guides to leade them, they cannot but decay which haue no vision, Prouer. 29, 18. As the Lampe is extinguished without oyle, so religion and knowledge will decay without preaching, which is as the oyle to the lampe: as grasse withers without raine, and our bodies starue without foode, so doe our soules without sound doctrine seasonably giuen, which is as raine and food to the soule.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, heere is an admonition to all Magistrates, namely Patrons of beneficies, whom it concernes to prouide the people of Preachers, of whom they may heare instructions to life, as they will answere to God for their soules. And thirdly to the people, that they do<note place="margin">Preaching of the word is as Oyle, faith as the Lampe. As the Lamp without oyle goeth out, so faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out preaching</note> earnestly desire and seeke to liue vnder the preaching of the Gospell, where they may heare the doctrine of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; for where preaching may ordinarily be had, God neuer workes an inward calling, without an outward vocation, nor is knowne to giue faith without hearing. Therefore as men bee carefull to dwell in places where there is good ayre, water, &amp;c. because these things are healthfull for the body: so, as they couet the health of their soules, let them much more seate themselues where the preaching of the worde is to bee had, in constant course from Sabbaoth to Sabbaoth.

God to preach the Gospel vnto the Iewes and Gentiles, verse 15. Secondly, that it is not to bee maruailed at, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the most Iewes remained vnbeleeuers, Verse 16.

                     <p>It is so, yet in this place it is fitly applyed vnto the<note place="margin">Solution.</note> preaching of saluation by Christ, because it was the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all temporall deliuerances whatsoeuer: for see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the oppressions and miseries of Gods people, were

                     <p>That the true and diligent Minister of the Gospel ought greatly to bee had in reuerence.

                     <p>Because to beleeue is the chiefest obedience, &amp; it is commanded vs to beleeue in Christ, 1 Iohn 3, 23. and our reason and iudgement is naturally repugnant to the Doctrine of the word: for they are darknesse, Ephes. 5, 8. Therefore to assent to the word, and willingly to beleeue the truth without reasoning and gainsaying, it is a verie great obedience.

Also experience proueth the truth heereof, for the Prophets complaine that few beleeue their preaching, Esay 53, 1. Also Christ, when hee prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the doctrine of the Gospell most clearly, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily confirmed it by myracles, yet but one heere and there did receiue it, scarse one man of a thousand: such also was the successe of the Apostles preaching, as this place proueth, and such it is continually.</p>

                     <p>It is true, that hearing of the word is necessarie to faith, but not on the contrary doth faith necessarilie follow of hearing.

                     <p>Because all are not elect, and it is a certain thing, that onely such as are ordained to life, do beleeue, Actes 13, 48. Thence it is called the Faith of the elect, Titus 1, 1. and they are said to be called which are predestinate, Rom. 8, 31. Secondly, because outward hearing is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to engender faith, there must be also an opening of the eyes and heart, by the Spirit, <hi>Acts</hi> 26, 18. and 16, 14. But this Spirit the world cannot receiue, Iohn 14, 17. Such onely receiue it to whom it is giuen, Math. 13, 11. And Esay 53, 1. hauing saide, few beleeued their report, addeth this as a reason, because <hi>The arme of the Lord was not reuealed,</hi> that is, Gods powerfull spirit did not touch their hearts effectually. Thirdly, in some their pride and ouer-weening, by conceyuing too highly of their owne wit and vnderstanding, leaning vnto their owne naturall wisedome, is a very great hinderance to faith, Math. 11, 25. 1 Cor. 1, 26. Fourthly, many stumble at the pouertie of Christ and his followers, Mat. 11, 6. To which may be added the wicked examples of preachers and professors of the Faith, as a great obstacle.</p>

<pb n="830" facs="tcp:20835:412"/>
to cause men to thinke ill of the Doctrine, as if it were the proper cause of wickednesse, or at the leastwise vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to conuert sinnes: whereas the faulte is not in the word, nor alwayes in the teachers, but in the indisposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion &amp; naughtines of the hearers, the seede being good, but the ground barren and euill. Secondly, it confutes such as thinke the Faith of the Gospell to proceede (in part at the least) from the naturall strength of mans free will: whereas this beeing equall and of the like force in all men, then should all men haue Faith, and equally o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the Gospell. If free will were the cause of beleeuing, that is, if men did therefore beleeue and receiue Grace offered, because they are willing to receiue it, &amp; might refuse if they would: if Faith might come after this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion, who is it but he would be content to be a belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer?

from the Apostles: therefore it is saide [<hi>Our report,</hi>] in which word, the thing which is the obiect of hearing, is put for hearing it selfe.</p>

                     <p>That the Prophets by the Spirit of prophesy, did<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> foresee what effects would follow the Gospell preached to the Iewes. God foreseeth all thinges of himselfe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily: men do it secondarily by the helpe of his Spirit. Secondly, we learne that it is a cause of great greefe to the Ministers of God, to see none or little fruite to come of their teaching Heb. 13, 17. wherein they must shewe patience, considering it was the portion of Christ his Prophets and Apostles. Thirdly, wee learne, that when the Gospell was first deliuered to the Iewes, the smallest number did receiue it, euen an handfull in respect of the rest which resisted it; like to the gleannings in haruest, or Grapes after the vintage. The cause heereof, was not the prophesie of <hi>Esay</hi> because he foretold it, but the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary rather beeing true, that because they were not to beleeue, therefore the Prophet so foretolde it: but the true causes wer two, 1. secret, viz: that God did not giue with his Gospell his inwarde effectuall illumination of his Spirit, to reueal Christ in them. The second was open and outward, namely the person of Christ being poore and meane, and his passion reproachfull; which bred in the Iewes, a contempt of him, and of his teaching, Esay 53, 3, 4.</p>

For <hi>Adam</hi> in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice, and the Iewes in <hi>Palestina</hi> the Holy Lande, yet disobeyed God. Thirdly, what the Scriptures foretell, must certainly come to passe: the prophesies of the old, so of the new Testament, must certainely bee fulfilled. Lastly, seeing Faith is not common vnto all hearers, let
<pb n="832" facs="tcp:20835:413"/>
such then as haue faith, see that there is great cause to be thankefull to God for such an vnspeakeable guift.</p>

                     <p>That our hearing is the accustomed occasion of faith by Gods ordination, through the working of the Spirite.

Howbeit, if by [word] we vnderstand the commandement of God enioyning teachers to preach, and Christians to heare it, will well agree with [sending,] spoken of in Scriptures Mat. 4, 4.</p>

Vnto which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle answereth, that the Gospell was then published to the whole world, therefore the Iewes must needes haue heard; for how could the Israelites bee without hearing, seeing the Gentiles (euen all the worlde besides) had heard? as it is heere prooued by the Apostle out uf the 19 Psalme, verse 4.</p>

The Iewes had chosen to themselues such as were no Gods, therefore God to vexe them, would take to him such as were no people; they had chosen to themselues another husband, and he had chosen another wife to bee euen with them. Now sinne as it hath the nature of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment is a good thing, and comes of God; for it is the execution of his iustice.</p>

                     <p>It teacheth how fearefull a thing the iustice of God is, in that for sinne he can strike not the body of men<note place="margin">Vse.</note> alone; but the very soules of men with new sinnes, filling them with more sins, which greedily follow their owne lusts; to shew himselfe the Lord and Gouernour of the soules, as well as of the flesh of men, and is able to wotke in them eyther good things according to his mercies, or euill things according to mens merites. Secondly, it warneth all men aboue all things to beware, as of all sin, so especially of sinning wittingly and willingly, after many instructions, and benefits, and admonitions to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, for God will plague such spiritually, by giuing them ouer vnto the power of sin, which is the most gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous iudgement vnder heauen, and it is so much the more greater, because it is insensible: for whereas all other iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be without sinne, this alone is with increase of guilt and sinne.</p>

Chapters; and on whole countries, as <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> and innumerable other kingdomes, which for contempt of this kindnesse tendred in the ministery of the worde, lye vnder Paganisme or Papisme; by whose example let vs bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished to beware and learn to come when God calles, to answere when he speakes, to repent when hee inuiteth vs thereunto. Thirdly, we are here admonished, that if we lose our paines &amp; patience, yet not to be discontent, seeing God himselfe had no better speed, and it is well, if the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant be as his Lord.</p>

                     <p>That the Iewes for trampling Gods mercies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foote, and spurning at his word, did deserue to bee reiected, and without wrong were refused of God: and secondly, that they had no cause at all to be angry, that the Gentiles were adopted, &amp; taken in to be Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their roome, seeing they wel deserued to be quite cut off.</p>

                     <p>First, that vnbeleefe of heart when the word of<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> God cannot perswade vs, is like the sinne of Rebellion. For such do in their hearts rise vp and resist God, as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels their Prince. Secondly, that infidelity doth bring forth and breede contradiction; therefore men are bold with their mouths, to speake against the doctrine of the Scriptures, because they do not vnderstand nor beleeue it: as faith engendreth reuerence of the word, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth vs to glorifie it, so incredulity procureth prophane men to speake ill of the word of God, and to raile at the true Ministers thereof; which howe greeuous and hey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous a sinne it is, may appeare by the punnishment God tooke on the Iewes whom he cast off for it. Thirdly, we learne, that both Ministers and other godly Christians, are to take it patiently when men resist the trueth which they vtter, seeing the vngodly Iewes did gainesay euen God himselfe, speaking to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by his Prophets: And are men better or greater then God? Shall God be gainsaid, and dost thou so take on and vexe, because thy worde or counsell is crossed and controlled? Learne humility, and be content to be contradicted.</p>

And se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to exhort the Gentiles (which were admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the voide roome of the refused Iewes) to bee modest and lowly minded, to take heede of the contempt of the Iewes who were faln, and of security; considering Gods mercies towards them in their free adoption, and Gods seuerity vnto the obstinate Iewes, whom yet he had not so abandoned, but that he could and would gather them againe into the folde of his Church. So as the drifte of this Chapter is two fold: one to keepe the Iewes from despaire, &amp; the other to preserue the Gentiles from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption and pride.</p>

doth three things. First, hee teacheth to the comsort of the Iewes, that a remainder of them were Gods elect, to verse 7. and thence vnro the 11. verse, <hi>Paul</hi> confirmeth by a double testimony, one out of Esay, and another out of <hi>Dauid,</hi> that the most part of the Iewes were reiected. Lastly, he openeth the finall cause or end of Gods coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, in casting off the vnbeleeuing Iewes (to wit) that thereby an occasion of calling the Gentiles might bee giuen, vnto ver. 17. The second part is exhortatorie vnto the Gentiles, to verse 25. The third part is Propheticall, fore-telling the vocation of the Iewes, vnto verse 33. And fourthly, a conclusion consisting of an exclamation and of a prayer vnto the end of the chapter.</p>

                     <p>This: O <hi>Paul,</hi> if the Iews be cast off (as thou see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest<note place="margin">Obiection.</note> to affirme out of <hi>Esay,</hi> that for their vnthankfulnes &amp; contempt of God, they are of him worthlly shut out) then are Gods people cast off. For the Iewes were Gods people, and if they bee cast off, then what becomes of Gods promises made to that people, and what hope doth there remaine of their saluation? Thus might weak ones reason against that which hee wrote in the end of the Chapter: but cauillers will bee ready to alledge the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his seed, whom God tooke of especiall fauour to be his owne people, so as hee should be vnconstant if he brake his owne couenant. All this is contained in the first words [<hi>I say then, hath God cast away his people,</hi>] that is, I see what you will say vpon my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer speeches, that Gods people are drawne away from grace and saluation.</p>

this his deniall by sufficient and strong arguments: As first, from his owne example. Secondly, from the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cause. Thirdly, from the example of <hi>Elias</hi> his time, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the present time wherein <hi>Paul</hi> wrote.</p>

                     <p>Thus: I <hi>Paul</hi> am a Iew (not a Proselite conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted<note place="margin">1.

Secondly, <hi>Iacob</hi> was loued and chosen of God, ere euer he had done any good thing, from Gods purpose, nor from his bare prescience. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9, 11. Thirdly, seeing all men were to be alike corrupt through sinne, there was no good thing hee could foresee in any; therefore all men shoulde haue beene reprobate, if his bare foresight had beene the ground and cause.

The wordes of our Text do fully auouch this truth, God casts not of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom he knew before; againe it is written, Mat. 24. 24. that it is not possible the elect should perish, and Rom. 8, 30. The predestinate shall be glorified: and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">Proofe from scripture.</note> Christ hath prayed for al the elect, that they may haue his glory in heauen, Iohn 17, 24. Reason also confirmeth this truth, for the loue of God is immutable, therefore they cannot perish whom he loues; for then should God alter and be changeable, if the elect could fal from Gods loue and be Reprobates; but because God changes not, he that is once loued of God, is euer loued, and therfore cannot bee condemned in hell. Hence is the election and fore-knowledge of God, compared vnto a seale and foundation, which bsares things of great stablenes, 1. Ti. 1, 17.

Thus they dealt with the Apostles, and nowe at this day, Anti-christian Prelates deale thus with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants, whose neckes they get vnder their girdles. The reason of this their sauage proceeding is, because they<note place="margin">Reason.</note> will do the workes of their Father the diuell; for hee is a murtherer, and so bee his Children giuen to bloude, Iohn 8, 44.</p>

                     <p>That God suffereth his Church and seruants to fall into verie greeuous afflictions for trial of their faith and patience. Thirdly, in the example of <hi>Elias,</hi> wee see the infirmitie of Gods Saints, how weake they are, and subiect to error, euen the best of them. For <hi>Elias</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, in thinking himselfe onely to remaine: for <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diah</hi> had hid a hundred Prophets in a Caue, and <hi>Paul</hi> tels vs, that a great many (euen seauen thousand) were reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by God.

are imputed to the people oftentimes, when they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaude and consent vnto them, as these Israelites did: therefore <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>They killed the Prophets,</hi> whereas <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabell</hi> acted the murther, the people onely liked of it, and so made it their owne: as <hi>Achab</hi> is saide to haue killed <hi>Naboth,</hi> because hee agreed to it.

                     <p>No, for the answere had foure parts, as his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint was foure-fold: for first he complaineth of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and secondly of impiety; to which God gaue this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, that <hi>Hazael</hi> beeing annointed King of <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Iehu</hi> King of <hi>Samaria,</hi> they should bee reuenged on the Idolatrous and cruell <hi>Israelites,</hi> 1. kings 19, 16, 17. Then hee accuseth them of tyranny to him-selfe, whom they meant to kill, that God might haue neuer a Prophet; to
<pb n="855" facs="tcp:20835:424"/>
which God appointed this remedy, that <hi>Elisha</hi> should be made Prophet in his place, to maintaine Gods worship and glory. Now the last part was touching the small number of true worshippers in <hi>Israel:</hi> to this part God answereth, that he had reserued many thousands besides <hi>Elias,</hi> which were not defiled with Idols. This part of the answere because it serueth to <hi>Pauls</hi> purpose, hee set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it downe alone, passing by the rest, as impertinent to his matter.</p>

                     <p>It is true: the reason is because hee citeth the Scripture as an Interpreter, and therefore may vse more or fewer words as hee shall see it most meete to expresse the sence and drifte of the Spirite, from which <hi>Paul</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer taketh any thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

and Idolatry called Whoredome, because they forsake their Faith plight to God, and turn after strange Gods. Also they make their Idols their Patrons and defenders, as is to be seene in the Papacie, where euery Countrey and Citty hath some Saint for their Lord and defender, as S. <hi>Andrew</hi> for <hi>Scotland,</hi> Saint <hi>George</hi> for England, Saint <hi>Iames</hi> for <hi>Spaine,</hi> Saint <hi>Patrick</hi> for <hi>Ireland,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>Thereby is signified all the adoration and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship which is giuen to that Image, by a Synecdoche of the part for the whole: also it teacheth the behauiour of Idolators toward their Images whom they bow vnto, in token of subiection, and did kisse them in signe of dile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and loue; which superstitious gesture, is vnto this day obserued in Popery, where the Images of the virgin <hi>Marie</hi> and Apostles, are honoured with the bending of the knee, and the kisses of the mouth.</p>

                     <p>That when the eye of men cannot, yet God knowes<note place="margin">Reason.</note> and sees many thousand his seruants and children which belong to his Church. The reason is, because God kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth who be his, and nothing can be hid from his eyes.<note place="margin">Deus est totus Oculus.</note> Thus howsoeuer <hi>Elias</hi> then, and <hi>Paul</hi> afterwards, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them M. <hi>Luther, Wickliffe,</hi> and <hi>Caluin</hi> seemed to bee alone, yet as in <hi>Israel</hi> and amongst the Iewes, so in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Bohemia, France,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> there were euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>middest the Papistes verie many, which misliked the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition of Rome, and receyued the true Doctrine of Christ, though they were not for a time knowne and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant to the world.

If any shall ask how this may be, seeing either in those times they lacked the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke<note place="margin">Solution.</note> Ministery, or had it corrupt: the answere is, that they had so much of the doctrine of God priuatly as was sufficient to instruct them, and saue them, through Gods

blessing, who can saue by weake and few meanes, as wel as by strong and many. God needs no meanes, it is man for whose weakenesse sake meanes be prouided.</p>

                     <p>That not mens merits, nor their owne free will,<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> but Gods onely grace is the cause why some are sound, when most are corrupt. Therefore, it is not said they are reserued, or they haue reserued themselues: but (I haue reserued) to exclude all power of will and of merit, &amp; to attribute all wholly vnto the grace and free election of God, as verse 6. This confutes the Papists, which say wee bring one part, &amp; God another: parting stakes between<note place="margin">Vse.</note> Nature &amp; grace; for what haue we that we haue not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued?

                     <p>That Gods Children must liue to his gloric, and be addicted to please and honour him, who alone saueth them.

                     <p>That howsoeuer in the inuisible Church of the
<pb n="858" facs="tcp:20835:426"/>
faithfull, there be multitudes perfectly and plainely seene vnto that God (who knoweth who bee his and where his bee) yet the visible Church of such as are outwardly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, is oftentimes obscured and decayed, in such sort as the publike exercise of religion faileth; the people of God by persecution beeing driuen into corners, as Conies by vermine are chased into their holes and Doues by the Kite into the cleft of the rocke. The Christian Church which is alwaies glorious within or inwardly, as a Queene which sitteth in her chamber cloathed with gold: yet shee is not euer glorious and illustrious without to the eye of the world, but is sometime like a desolate, solitary, and forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken widow. For the Church once consisted in two persons <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue,</hi> and afterwardes in the family of <hi>Abraham</hi> and of <hi>Lot:</hi> also euen in <hi>Iuda</hi> the visible Church was som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time driuen into straite and narrow places, as in the dayes of Idolatrous <hi>Ahaz,</hi> 2, <hi>Kings</hi> 16, 17, also in the raigne of <hi>Ammon</hi> and <hi>Manasses</hi> 2, <hi>Kings</hi> 25, 4, 5, 22. when for the most part they fell to Idolatry, and forlooke the true God and broke his couenant. Againe, how was the Church vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible at the time of Christs passion, when the Virgin Mary only, and a few others did appeare and prosesse him openly, the rest being fled away for feare of the Iewes? Also after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the raigne of the beast, when Sathan was let loose, howsoeuer there might many be, &amp; no doubt were many, which feared God and serued him in secret, yet there was a time when to the appearance of men there seemed to be but one <hi>Luther</hi> in <hi>Germanie,</hi> one <hi>Husse</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> one <hi>Caluine</hi> in <hi>Sauoy,</hi> one <hi>Zuinglyus</hi> in <hi>Heluetia,</hi> and one <hi>Waldos in France,</hi> one <hi>Wickleff</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and one <hi>Patrick</hi> in <hi>Scotland:</hi> as heere in our Text we finde, that among all the ten tribes <hi>Elias</hi> did dreame or iudge himselfe to bee left alone. Thus as the sea sometimes flowes and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ebs, and the Moone is some time in the full, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in the wanc, so the visible Church is by the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of God, some times greater and more copious; and againe, other while it is more lesser and more slender
<pb n="859" facs="tcp:20835:426"/>
euen according as the doctrine of the word is more or lesse cleare and pure; for the doctrine and the Church depend one vppon the other, and do shine together, or be darkned together.</p>

The which exception I will here repeate, expecting your answere vnto them seuerally as I shall propound them. First, they say the Nation of the Isralites was then no part of the Church of God. Secondly, that these seauen thousand were at Ierusalem, in the kingdome of Iuda; wherein were many more then seauen thousand that openly wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shipped God. Thirdly that the Christian Church, resteth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon better promises then the Iewish Church did. Fourthly, that not onely seauen thousand, but not so many as seauen, nay not scarce one could be found of Luthers beleefe, at the least not to consent with him in all poyntes of the faith: These are their maine obiections: shew vs I pray you what answere may bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto them?</p>

If they speake or write any thing in defence of their errours, which seemeth but probable, they care not how little soundnesse and substance of truth there is in it, as will appeare in the sisting and scanning of these their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions particularly. And therefore this I say to the first, that howsoeuer the Nation of the Iewes weere exceeding corrupt and Apostaticall, hauing broken their first faith, plight vnto God: in stead of whome they worshipped <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,</hi> the God of the <hi>Sidonians,</hi> as sacred story reportes: yet God had not giuen to them a bill of deuorce, it remayned still a Sinagogue, and part of the visible Church. Had it bin otherwise, God would not haue giuen vnto them his, word &amp; sent them his Prophets, as <hi>Elias, Elzeus,</hi> and others
<pb n="860" facs="tcp:20835:427"/>
to instruct them in his statutes, except there had beene in <hi>Israel,</hi> some of that people, which he had knowne before, and loued from euerlasting; and certaine it is that where soeuer there is a Preacher, and some to receiue the word, there is a Church. The Church may consist in one man that receiueth the word, as <hi>Luther</hi> writeth of himselfe, that if he were alone, and did alone beleeue, he himselfe were the Church, yea (saith he) if the word of God were in hell, euen in hell there would be a Church: likewise there was a Church in <hi>Israel</hi> so long as they receiued the worde, the hauing or not hauing whereof, maketh a Church or no Church.</p>
                     <p>To the second, it is very sure that these seauen thousand were not in <hi>Iuda,</hi> but in the backe-sliding kingdome of <hi>Samaria:</hi> for there it was that knees were bowed vnto <hi>Baal;</hi> also there it was that <hi>Elias</hi> was left alone, and there did <hi>Obediah</hi> hide the hundred Prophets of the Lord: as for <hi>Iuda, Elias</hi> had no cause to complaine of it, for hee knew very well that there were many true worshippers of God, the very Souldiors amounting to ten hundred thousand, 1. Chron. 17, 14, 15. &amp;c. Now to the thirde exception I say, that indeed the Christian Church if wee respect the promises of saluation, had better (that is to say) more clearer and full ones, shaddowes and tipes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now ceased, and Christ being now come in flesh; but touching (continuance) the Iewish Church had no lesse the promise of God to abide till his first comming, then the Church had for her continuance, till his second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. And concerning the outward estate of the Church eyther of the olde or of the new Testament, God did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer promise that it should bee alwayes visible. To the fourth it is true, for besides all such as consented vnto him in the kingdomes of <hi>Armenia, Gracia, Slecia, Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> where 54. noble men wrote to the Councell in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of Maister <hi>Iohn Husse,</hi> to iustifie his opinions and teaching to bee Orthodoxe; there were innumerable in the midst of Popery, which were of <hi>Luthers</hi> minde, both

great reformation, which (methinkes) I see now to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach apace. And to one who demanded of him, why he did not beginne to discouer and resute corruptions in doctrine and life? he answered, I am stricken in years, weake in strength of body and minde: but GOD shall raise vp one of an heroicall spirite, full of courage and strength, industrious and eloquent, which shall mightily oppose himselfe vnto errors, and begin the reformation of the Church; to whom God shall giue such an heart, as he shalbe bold to resist euen the Potentates of the earth; which thing was afterward fulfilled in Mayster <hi>Luther.</hi>

For circumstances they do agree: <hi>Elias</hi> the prophet was raised vp extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, so was <hi>Paul</hi> myraculously called to be an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle. Againe, as <hi>Elias</hi> alone was zealous for the worship of God so <hi>Paul</hi> alone of all the Iewes, was an earnest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender of the Doctrine of God: and as very manie resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted <hi>Elias,</hi> so not a few persecuted <hi>Paul:</hi> and as in <hi>Elias</hi> time Idolatry had ouerspread the kingdome of <hi>Samaria,</hi> so in <hi>Pauls</hi> time Hellenisme and Pharasaisme preuailed in the world.

there issueth an argument and similitude, in the very phrase and manner of speech; for in <hi>Elias</hi> story God sayed; I haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>That it makes much for our comfort, to lay toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> the olde and present state of the Church, namely in time of afflictions. The reason is, because God is wont<note place="margin">Reason.</note> for the most part, to vse like proceedings in the gouerning of his Church: therfore in the afflicted state of the Church it will be very profitable to looke backe to former times of persecutions: that as <hi>Paul</hi> by considering <hi>Elias</hi> his time, armed himselfe against the fewnesse of professors; so Gods children by such conference of times, may stay their minds in patience. For no crosses nowe happen, but the like or worse haue falne in former ages of the Church. It is vsual with the Papistes to boast of multitudes, howe many, and how mighty bee their friendes and followers, the Gentry, the Nobles, Ladies and Lords, Dukes, Arch-dukes, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Kings, Emperours, Learned men, Cardinalles, Popes, are on their side, and walke in their way: whereas for most part, a company of silly Tradesmen, and silly persons, take part with vs. To whom though we might truly say, that our number is greater by a good many then they would haue it, and that if the trueth of religion went by number, then the Turkes and other Pagans should bee the true Church, rather then Papists; which come short in multitude of the Pagans, Iewes, and Turkes: Yet let vs cast our eye backe vppon <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Paules</hi> times, concluding that as then the multitude of Idolaters and vnbeleeuers did no preiudice to the trueth and worship of God, (which may be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and professed by a few as well as by many;) so nowe
<pb n="866" facs="tcp:20835:430"/>
the faith of the Gospell, if but one onely professed it in the world, (whereas God is to be thanked, many Nations and Kings doe receiue it,) were not the lesse wholesome and sound, though the whole world besides, did goe after the great whore, as sometime it did. But come nowe nearer<note place="margin">Parts.</note> to the wordes of our Text, which haue two parts. First, that a remnant of beleeuers were amongst the Iewes when <hi>Paul</hi> preached. Secondly, the true cause heereof is the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>

<pb n="867" facs="tcp:20835:430"/>
because in the Church of GOD, there are euer some to whome they are effectually perfourmed, howesoeuer the most neglect and refuse them; yet there is a remnant which receiue them still, and are saued by them.</p>

                     <p>The guift of predestination, or the grace whereby men are elected or predestinated; or (by an Hebraisme) a gracious and free election. The meaning is, that such as are kept free from the pollution of Idolatry and other sins, they may not thanke themselues as if they were worthy of it for their workes sake; but are beholding to the good pleasure of God, who hath separated them from others, according to his gracious purpose. Note that election is not here put and taken actiuely, whereby wee chuse grace, but passiuely, whereby men were chosen of God: for hee speaketh of such as were foreknown of God, verse second, of Gods election of men, and not of mens election of God.</p>

                     <p>That election vnto eternall life proceedeth from the free fauour and grace of God. This is the same with that which is written, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9, 11, 15, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1, 4, 5. <hi>Ro,</hi> 15, 19.</p>

                     <p>First, it confuteth the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> who affirme that<note place="margin">Vse.</note> men chuse Gods mercies, &amp; not that his free mercies chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth them, whereas this text plainly speaketh not of mans electing God, but of Gods electing men out of his grace, not out of their owne merites. Also it ouerthrowes the conceite of <hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> which vpon this place imagine some men which beleeue in Christ, to be saued by grace, and others which besides faith, haue good workes, to be saued by the election of grace; deuiding things which
<pb n="868" facs="tcp:20835:431"/>
are conioyned, to wit, election and grace, faith and works, as if there could be a iustifying faith without works. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it abateth the pride of all flesh, to teach that electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on commeth not from themselues, but is wholly of grace.

                     <p>That if election be of grace, then our iustification, sanctification, and glorification, all be from grace too, as it is written, 2. Tim. 1, 9. Rom. 3, 24, 28. The reason here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, <hi>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes verily, they are as contrary as can be: when the cause of election and saluation is to be searched out, there is no coniunction of grace and workes, no more then of light and darkenesse, as the text speaketh If it be of faith, then not of works. The reason hereof is, because merite of works being once put and granted, grace is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, as it is heere written, then were grace no grace.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>What is the cause of this consequence, that therefore grace is destroyed if works be admitted as a partner in the cause of election and saluation?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>The reason is, because grace giueth eternall life and whatsoeuer belongs to it, as a thing not due, but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of workes craues them all as a debt: therefore if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, calling, iustification, &amp;c. should not bee wholly from grace, but in part also from workes, then grace should not remaine free, and therefore shoulde not bee grace: see Rom. 4, 4, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It refuteth such as in the mystery of election, iustification, &amp;c. doe mingle grace and merite of workes together, ascribing some-what to grace, some-what to workes foreseene in matter of election past, or present in matter of iustification; whereas these thinges by God
<pb n="869" facs="tcp:20835:431"/>
himselfe, are pronounced, <hi>asystata,</hi> which haue no agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all together. Secondly, we are taught that it is impossible that the Church of God should faile upon earth, because it doth springe out of the election and grace of God, which cannot at any time vtterly faile. Thirdly, it conuicteth them of error which heere vnderstand by grace infused grace, the habite of iustice powred into mans heart by the Spirite; whereas the Apostle speaketh heere of grace, as it is in God (subiectiue) as in a subiect, and doth oppose it as a thing contrary to the works of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse which be in men, as to a contrary; and tels vs what he meanes by grace, to wit, the election of God. Lastly, this must prouoke all beleeuers to ioyfull thankefulnesse, seeing God when he could not saue them by works which they had not, did by his franke grace chuse and saue them: which deserues at our hands al possible praise both in word and deed, in life and death. Such as bee often mindefull of such a free mercy, to glorifie God for it, it is a good signe that they be vnder this grace, and are euen the chosen chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>The argument is taken from the opposition or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy of flat contraries, such as in no wise can stand and consist together, being immediate contraries. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument may thus bee framed: If election and calling bee of meritorious works, then it is not of grace; but they both come of grace, therefore not of workes.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That is not possible, for if election were both of<note place="margin">Solution.</note> grace and workes, then workes were no workes; because what doth proceede of grace, that commeth freely not of debt; but what commeth by merite of workes, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by debt; but debt and no debt, that which is free, and by deseruing, bee most contrary thinges. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to say, that men are elected and called, partly of grace, partly of the merit of foreseene workes, that were to put togither things that cannot agree, to make debt no debt, merit no merit, workes no workes, Grace no grace, and so to affirm and deny one and the same thing; which is a most absurde matter, and vtterly not possible to make contradictories to be both true. For as a sonne that is willed to go on an errand to <hi>Rochester</hi> on foot, his father promising him a crowne or an angell at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming backe: if his Father aske him how he will haue his money? suppose that hee aunswere, that he will haue it
<pb n="871" facs="tcp:20835:432"/>
partly by fauour, and partly by desert: the reply to him is ready, Thou canst not so haue it; for if it be of fauour, then it commeth freely, therefore not by desert of the worke: and if it be by desert of the worke, then not by fauour; for it is due that commeth by merit &amp; desert, and there is no being beholding to fauour for that.</p>

<pb n="872" facs="tcp:20835:433"/>
to auoide the force of this consequence: for some-times they say that the Apostle speaks only of ceremoniall works<note place="margin">Popish cua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</note> of the law, as of Circumcision, Sacrifices, &amp;c. But this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be so, because <hi>Pauls</hi> words be generall, shutting out all workes whatsoeuer, whether naturall, morall, or legall ceremonies. Of them all he saith, that if election to life eternall come of them, then it commeth not of grace. Also <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> had morall workes as well as cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall, yet in Chap. 4. verse 4, 5, 6. <hi>Paul</hi> denieth that <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Dauid</hi> were iustified and saued by any workes which they had done, but by faith.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they say that the Apostle speakes of the works of nature, which (say the Rhemists) doe exclude grace, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and mercy, challenging of debt, not of guift: but not of Christian mens workes, which come from the Spirite and grace of God; these workes comming from grace may euidently consist with the same, and be ioyned with Gods grace as causes of saluation. This shift cannot bee cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, not onely for that his words be generall, but because <hi>Paul</hi> speakes of the election by grace, by which all are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Therefore the merite of all workes are excluded, by whomsoeuer they bee done, whether by circumcised Iewe, or baptized beleeuing Christian, or vnbeleeuing Gentile, Secondly, in Ephe. 1, 4. good workes are saide not to be the cause of election, but the end, and fruite, and effect thereof. Lastly, Ephe. 2, 8, 9. <hi>Paul</hi> saith expresly, we are saued not of works, but by grace through faith: where note, that grace and faith may well stand together, but they doe shut out all sort of workes from being any moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing or meritorious cause of our iustification and saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, they say that good workes are shut out from election to the first grace, but not from election to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond grace, that is, they say that the elect are chosen of grace onely, and are also freely called and illuminated of the Holye-Ghost, without all workes: but the seconde grace, that is, iustification, also sanctification, and glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
<pb n="873" facs="tcp:20835:433"/>
these do admit merite of works to ioyne with grace. Vnto this shifte of theirs I answere, that that Scripture which saith that election is of grace, and, we are called ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to grace, 2. Tim. 1, 9. doth also say that wee are iustified by grace, not by workes, Rom. 3, 24. that eternall life is the gift of God, Rom. 6, 23. also iustification and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification bee fetched from Gods eternall loue and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, as the first and onely efficient cause, as well as election and calling, Rom. 8, 30. Moreouer, election is not onely to the first grace, but to all the meanes and to heauenly glory, which is the end, Rom. 9, 11, 23. Lastly, the Pharisie who ascribed righteousnes and saluation part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to grace, and partly to his good workes, went away vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustified. Whatsoeuer therefore the Papists can alleadge to shake and weaken the credite of this texte, yet it is so strong to ouerthrow the doctrine of popish merites, and iustification by workes, as one of themselues <hi>Andreas Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> was wont to say in his publike readings, My brethren, sithence holy Scripture attributeth whatsoeuer we are, or haue, al vnto grace, whence commeth that horrible darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and superstition, to ascribe so much to merite of workes? Truely the estate of Christianity needes very great and speedy reformation.</p>

                     <p>Here is an admonition to all Christians, that albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it they are bound to doe good workes of all sorts, and to abound in them, yet it is their duty to renounce the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of them, and all trust in them, and to sticke whollye and onely in the grace of God through Iesus Christ, for all things belonging to their saluation, least if wee put neuer so little trust in any thing done by vs, we be found the aduersarics of Gods grace. Further we are taught heereby, that the Romish Synagogue cannot be the true Church of Christ, because most obstinately &amp; impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they persist to ascribe mans iustification and saluation partly to grace, &amp; partly to merite of works; and thereby
<pb n="874" facs="tcp:20835:434"/>
doe ouerthrow the doctrine of grace, which is the very soule and life of a true Church: for take away the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of free election, iustification, and saluation, and presently the very foundation of all religion is shaken to pieces; so farre it is off that they can bee the true Church, hauing cast downe the groundworke whereon it resteth. Lastly, it conuicteth such of error, as vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand this text to bee meant of grace infused into mans heart, whereas grace being set against workes: therefore as workes doe sticke in men as in their proper subiect, so grace heere spoken of hath no other subiect but God.</p>

                     <p>The reason is, because they seeke amisse, and<note place="margin">Reason.</note> not as they ought; whereas that promise is made to such as seeke aright. Vnto which, two things are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered: First the manner, that we seeke these things by faith: and secondly, that we intend Gods glorye as the end of our seeking: see Rom. 9, 30. Many Israelites fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in both these, for they sought righteousnes and life by their owne workes, and therefore obtained it not, as it is written, Rom. 9, 31, 32. and 10, 3.

                     <p>That in the bosome of the Church of God, there haue alwayes liued two kinds of people, some elect and called, some Reprobate and hardened. This diuision be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne in <hi>Adams</hi> family in <hi>Caine</hi> and <hi>Abell,</hi> whence did spring two Cities (as <hi>Augustine</hi> obserueth) one of God, another of the world; it was continued in the family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Ismael,</hi> the one of them beeing the childe of the Flesh, and the other the Childe of the promise.

The high<note place="margin">Reason.</note> and soueraigne cause heereof is the wil of God, shewing mercy to whom he will, and hardening whom hee will, Rom. 9, 17. The subordinate cause and second reason is, that there are two beginnings of mankinde, the seed of the woman Christ Iesus, the heade of the elect; and the Serpent Satan, the Prince of this world, which begetteth children of differing and contrary dispositions and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, 1 Iohn 3, 8, 9. and Iohn 15, 19.</p>

This stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornnesse is noted in Scripture by sundry similitudes, as of a stone, of an Iron sinnew, of a brazen forehead, of an heart of Adamant, Ezek. 11, 19. Esay 48, 4. Zach. 7, 12. Heere in <hi>Zacharie,</hi> as also in that place of Esay, there is a plaine description of an hard heart. Sec Verses 11, 12, of <hi>Zachary.</hi>

                     <p>Two: one Naturall, which all men bring from the wombe, called a stonie heart by <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in chap. 11. verse 19. for all men from their birth are enclined to the disobedience of God, being sinners and enemies, vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the Children of Gods wrath. Secondly, there is an habituall hardnesse which is gotten by long custome of sinne, which for a time takes away both the feare and feeling of sinne. This is common both to elect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, but with great difference. For hardnesse of heart in the elect, before their conuersion is totall and temporary, it wholly possesseth them, but it continueth onely vntill their calling; after that their hardnesse is partiall, mixt with tenderncsse and softnesse of heart, as in <hi>Dauid</hi> and <hi>Peter:</hi> but in the reprobate it is totall and perpetuall, so as they remaine wholly obdurate and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate till their death, as did <hi>Cain, Esau, Pharaoh, Iudas,</hi>
                        <pb n="878" facs="tcp:20835:436"/>
and these refused Iewes heere spoken of. And this last hardnesse is that which is heere meant in our text, which is both of the whole heart, and final, or for euer. For this onely is peculiar to such as be not elected, as the nearest &amp; iust cause of their destruction; which is inflicted vpon them, not so much for sinne, as for beeing hardened in sinne for their impenitency in sin, to the end of their life notwithstanding al means vsed to soften and cause them to relent and turne to God from their sinne.</p>

                     <p>That finall stubbornenesse in sin, when a sinner obstinately continueth till his death in one, or more knowne sins, is a certaine marke of distinction betweene an elect childe of God which shall bee saued, and him which shall be for euer condemned, as appeareth Rom. 9, 17, 18. Math. 13, 15. Iohn 17, 11. 1 Iohn 5, 18. The Reasons heere of be, because it is neither sinne, nor the<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> number, nor the long continuance in them, that makes the actuall difference. For in all these things, many of the elect and reprobates are like; therefore that which doth it, must needes be this vniuersall and finall hardnesse of heart, vnto which reprobates are giuen ouer, and so are not the elect. For whome God elects, into their hearts
<pb n="879" facs="tcp:20835:436"/>
he puts his Spirit, which changeth their stony hearts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fleshy, being made pliable by his will: but the rest (as our Text is) they are hardned and left in their naturall corruption, to persist in it to death; and this is the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reason of the doctrine, that the elect haue their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural stubbornnesse corrected by the Spirit of sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which altereth and reneweth them vnto the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the word, 1 Pet. 1, 2. 2 Thess. 2, 13.</p>

                     <p>It may serue to keepe vs from rash iudgement,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> that wee neuer giue finall sentence vppon any man, to brand him for a reprobate; for who can tell if a wicked man will so continue vnto the end of his life? some haue beene called at the ninth houre of the day, some chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged at the eleauenth, and one (to wit the Theefe on the crosse) conuerted at the twelfe and last houre. Secondly, heere is a warning to all Christians, aboue all thinges in the world, to striue against hardnesse of heart, and to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for soft and obedient hearts; for as this latter hart<note place="margin">Ezek. 11, 19, 20.</note> (to wit) when it is mooued and bowed by God to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his worde, is the greatest blessing, being the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar note of the Childe of God, and a speciall fruit of the Couenant; so the other (to wit) a stiffe and vnyeelding heart, is the greatest curse, beeing the marke of cast-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes and reiected persons; vnto which euery man is so much the nearer, the nearer he is vnto hardnes of heart; and so much the further off, the more softe and contrite his heart is.</p>
                     <p>This admonition will be found so much the more need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if we duely consider with our selues these two things. First, that we liue in times of exceeding great case, plenty, and prosperity; by which meanes the heartes of men are most vsually hardened and made forgetsull of God: as it is written, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 15. of the Israelites, when they were full and well fed, they forgot the strong God that made them, and prooued like the vngratefull Horse, that spurneth and
<pb n="088" facs="tcp:20835:437"/>
kickes at his maister that fedde him. Secondly, that this iudgement of hardnes of heart, hath generally ouerspread most men which nowe professe the Gospell, all places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of wilfull sinners, which haue hearts as hard as the flint, or the smithes anuell, or the adamant; such as no meanes, faire nor soule, either benefits or afflictions, thret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings or promises, can either breake or somuch as bend them. The very word it selfe, which should be the meanes of softning them, through their owne mallice, prooues a greater meanes to harden them. Therefore in this generall hardnesse of hearte, there is the more cause for all men to take heede to themselues to preuent it in themselues by all good courses: as namely, besides the constant vse of the publike workes of religion, prayer, sacraments, the word read and preached: these foure things following, are to be done of all which desire to escape an hardned heart. First, in time of any affliction to worke their hearts earnestly to feele Gods displeasure in it, and their owne sinnes which procured it, alwayes begging that euery affliction may be effectually blessed, to the humbling of their hearts. In time of their prosperity, dayly to confesse their knowne sinnes particularly vnto God, with great griefe for the offence of God in them all and euery one of them. Then to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate often and earnestly, of Gods iudgements against sinne in this worlde and in hell: also to meditate of the passion and death of Christ crucified, of their owne mortality and death, of the day of iudgement. Lastly, to inure themselues to mourne as well for their small as great sinnes, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyde diligently the occasion of all sinnes. In the third place heere is an exhortation to stirre vp such to giue God thankes, as haue receiued a soft and sanctified heart, a sure testimony of their election by grace, when their hearts are so tender, as euery worde of God can pierce and prick it, and take place for framing them to the sound obedience of his will. 2 <hi>Thes.</hi>2. 13. <hi>Acts</hi>2, 37.</p>

This part is so knit to the former, as it contayneth the proofe of that which was said in the latter end of the 7. ver. touching the hardning of reprobate Iewes. The proofe is a diuine testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony: God so appointed it, and the Scriptures long before prophesied of their hardnesse. Therefore I haue truely said that the rest were hardned. Hee doeth not so much proue the thing, to witte, their hardnesse, as to shewe whence it came, from God so punishing the contempt of his worde, as a most righteous Iudge, [God hath giuen.]</p>

Whatsoeuer is necessary (sayeth a Father) is plainely set downe in Scripture.

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>A twofold vse of holy Scripture. First, that it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> is sufficient to confirm all doctrines of godlines. <hi>Paul</hi> and other pen-men of the worde, vse no other proofe of<note place="margin">Reason.</note> doctrine; therefore this probation alone is enough, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine testimonies are too weake to prooue, (though they bee sound and agreeable to the worde,) because the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, in matters of saluation is not satisfied, till it heare and haue the voyce and worde of God himselfe, whose word is <hi>autopiston,</hi> woorthy of credite for it selfe, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men to bee beleeued for the wordes sake; the witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of woorthy men, serues to bewray their consent with vs, and ours with them in the same trueth. Therefore we alledge them when neede is and cause requires, sparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; placing them as seruants after their Lorde, to test, not to iudge; this warnes vs to receiue no doctrine which will not admitte probation from Scripture. <hi>Quod legimus, id credimus,</hi> (sayeth <hi>Hierome,</hi>) wee beleeue so much as wee reade: we are forbid by <hi>Paul</hi> to be wise aboue that which is written.</p>
                     <p>The second vse of holy Scripture is, to serue vs not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to proue, but to declare and interprete doctrines. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as the light of the Sunne sheweth it selfe and other<note place="margin">Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are so tempered, as that is plaine in one place which is dark in another. <hi>Aug.</hi>
                        </note> things, so doth holy Scripture, though the Spirite be the principall interpreter of Scripture, yet the Scriptures be the soueraigne and most certaine meane of interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, one place which is obscure and harde, beeing made more easie by some place which is plaine. As for the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned fathers, whatsoeuer the councell of <hi>Trent</hi> haue attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
<pb n="883" facs="tcp:20835:438"/>
to their vniforme consent, as if that were the surest rule of interpretation, yet they are but subordinate and<note place="margin">It is lawfull for vs to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, how shall we know what is Gods minde, but from God himselfe declaring it in his word? for according to it, an exposition is lawfull without danger or biasphemy: as heere (hardnesse) is interpreted by [spirite of slumber,] and this is declared by eyes, which see not, and eares that heare not, and heart which vnderstandeth not.

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It signifies properly a dead and deepe sleepe,<note place="margin">Interpret.</note> called (Lethargy,) which so bindeth the sences of men as they cannot bee awaked with pricking and much pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching; such a sleepe as <hi>Adam</hi> was cast into, Gen. 2. But by a Metaphor it doth imply spirituall sencelesnesse or drowsinesse and blockishnesse in diuine matters, which pertaine to Gods worship and mans saluation; it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in <hi>Esay</hi> 51, 23. a Cup of fury and madnesse, by a speech borrowed from such as being made drunke, behaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues like mad and frantike men. Such a thing is this

slumber, it takes from men all sence of godlinesse, and makes them euen as furious beasts and drunken men, which feele and feare nothing in the midst of extreame dangers. Whereas some translate that (compunction or pricking) which is heere englished (slumber,) indeed the greeke word signifies so, as Acts 2. 37. Then it doth set foorth the same thing by a metalepsis, of the effect for the cause; for they which are ouertaken with hardnesse, and the dead sleepe of sinne, they are both pricked with griefe, and euen vexed at the hart with anger at the word rebuking and threatning them, Acts 7, 54. and yet being thus pricked and vexed, they be not awaked out of their slumber to returne to God, and forsake their euil waies, no more then one in an heauy sleepe can be awaked by shaking and pinching, &amp; hollowing or crying, or blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an horne in their care.</p>

                     <p>Spirite though sometimes it signifies no more but the mind, as <hi>Esra</hi> 1, 1. <hi>Esay</hi> 19, 3. yet heere it noteth the instrumentall cause of this slumber, to wit, the euill spirite, or Sathan, which God as a iust Iudge sendeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to wicked men in his righteous iudgement, to direct and driue their hearts to wicked thingsas he sendeth a good Spirit into his Children, to direct and moue their hearts and wils to good things. This is vsuall in Scripture when the word (spirite) hath put to it epithites good or bad, then it noteth the operations and effects of Gods grace or iustice. As Spirite of truth, peace, grace, loue, wisedome, prayer, &amp;c. signifieth these good things, and Gods Spirite to be the worker of them. On the other side, the spirite of fury, giddinesse, slumber, fornication, enuy, lying, error, &amp;c. noteth these bad effects, and Sathan the euill spirite to be the worker and neerest cause of the same.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, that wicked men which are vnder hardnesse<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> of heart, are vtterly blockish and sencelesse in respect of
<pb n="885" facs="tcp:20835:439"/>
diuine and heauenly things, as a man which is in a great slumber, vnderstandeth nothing of earthly things. This is that which is plainly saide in Esay 6, 9. and Mat. 13, 15. and Acts 28, 27. that though they see his workes, and heare his words, yet they neyther heare nor see, but are without vnderstanding, euen like Horse and Mule, that haue no discretion, Psalme 32, 9. so are the wicked very brutish and stupid in the matters of heauen.</p>
                     <p>In other matters which belong to this present life, they be (for the most part of them) quick-sighted, verie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident and circumspect, one must rise earely that would deceiue them or go beyond them in bargaining; Nay, they haue the slight to fetch ouer others, and hee must haue both his eyes in his head that shall escape them: but come to the things that belong to God and eternall life; it is a wonder how little vnderstanding and sight, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and sence they haue heerein. An image heereof we haue in <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> Iohn 3, 4. the Woman of <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> Iohn 4. the Scribes and Pharisies, &amp;c. Secondly, from hence we may see why the wicked profit not by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions of the word, euen because they are fast asleep in sinne, and inwardly deafe, hauing their eares stopped, and their eyes shut vp, and their hearts hardned. When they that are lyers, backbiters, promise breakers, Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, &amp;c. reade and heare that which is written, Psal. 15, verse 3, 4, 5. When couetous persons, railers, &amp;c. reade what is written, 1 Cor, 6, 9, 10. When such as liue in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, adultery, &amp;c. heare or reade what is written, Gal. 5, 19, 20, 21. When ignorant persons reade or heare that which is written, 1 Thessal. 1, 8. and proude persons that which is written, 1 Pet. 5. 5. and worldlings reade that which is written, Ephef. 5, 3. and yet are not reformed, nor once so much as go about to amend themselues: the reason cannot be, for that they thinke these thinges to be fables; (for they know and confesse them to be Gods word) or for that such sayings are darke (for they are so euident, cleare, and plaine, as anie childe may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb n="886" facs="tcp:20835:440"/>
them,) or because they are neuer tolde of these things, for their eares are continually beaten with those sayings. The true reason therefore is, for that they are like the deafe Adder spoken of in the Psalme, that will not heare the charmer. These sinners are deafe with the worst kinde of deafenesse, for they will not heare and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey: and who is so deafe, as he that will not heare They are like vnto the Iewes spoken of in Zach. 7, 11, 12. 13. and to such spoken of, Prou. 1, 24, 25. and to such as God speaketh of in another Prophet, <hi>I haue cried &amp; they would not answere:</hi> euen as it fareth with them that are in a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargie, though a Trumpet be sounded in their eares, yet they stirre not: so it is with these men, though Gods Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters to awake them do thunder out Gods iudgements lifting vptheir voices like a trumpet, yet they are no whit moued to Godwards, because the spirit of slumber is vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. It is written of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that he did not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the words of <hi>Moses,</hi> because his heart was harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Likewise the vngodly, while their soules be sence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse cannot but despise all the word, and their teachers which bring it and set it before them; which is a most dreadfull state. For the mouth of the Lorde hath spoken it, that when they cry to him in their extreamities, hee will heare them, Prou. 1, 26, 27, 28. <hi>Zach,</hi> 7, 13. These things, howsoeuer they are matter of greefe vnto Gods Ministers, yet are they still bound to do their dutie with constancy and patience, because it pleaseth God to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his iudgements vpon the wicked through their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, which shall be strong euidences against them to conuict their obstinacie. Gods word is a sweete smel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling sauour to GOD, euen when it is a sauour to death.</p>

                     <p>To haue eyes and eares vnfit to see and heare, or such eyes and eares wherewith they were not able to see and heare, as in <hi>Math,</hi> 13, 15. eares dull of hearing, and their eies heauy and shut, as in <hi>Esay</hi> 6, 10. and 29, 10. Men vse to say, As good neuer a whit, as neuer the better: so as good not to see or to heare, as by hearing and seeing to be neuer the better. But this is not altogether to be meant of bodily eares and eyes, but by a metaphor which tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slateth to the soule, that which is proper to the body: and then eyes and eares doe signifie here, such a minde so blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with ignorance, as it cannot knowe the true doctrine of saluation, and such an hearte as cannot obey the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. The summe then heereof is thus much, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate Iewes, though they had eares and did heare Gods word, and eyes to see Gods workes, with the sence of the body (for they heard Christ and his Apostles, and saw their myracles,) yet not all with the assent of the Soule; which was so farre from taking any profit to amendment and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, by that which they saw and heard, as they became rather blind in their vnderstandings, and in their wils more peruerse and obstinate.</p>

                     <p>Foure wayes: First in this, that their power of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and seeing was not taken from them. This mercy though it be contemptible because it is common, yet it is a great mercy, as would bee well perceiued and felt, were any of vs depriued of those corporall faculties. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there was affoorded them the best obiects of sight and hearing, to wit, the word of God which the Prophets first, and after Christ declared to them, thereby calling them to repentance and faith. Also many and most excellent my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, of healing the sicke, quickning the dead, restoring

sight to the blind, &amp;c. Besides innumerable works of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and gouernment, (I say) workes both of mercy and iustice, ordinary and extraordinary, which were continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before their eyes, to moue and stir them to God-wards. Thirdly, that the things which they did heare and see, were not onely wonderful and singular, but also that oftentimes and not seldome, they did see and heare them, which is sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the doubling of the verbe, <hi>Math.</hi> 13, 14. <hi>In hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, they shall heare.</hi> For whensoeuer a verbe is put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and thereunto is added an infinitiue moode, (beeing turned by a gerund) thereby is signified an often and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment action. Lastly, that besides these externall means offering grace to them, they had inwardly engrafted into them, some iudgement of conscience, and there was giuen them some light of vnerstanding, which none can deny, but that they are the good gifts of God.</p>

                     <p>It is true that they had no profite by them, but it was through their own default: but as the sunne is no lesse glorious and bright, because weak eies are offended ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, nor a plaister or oyntment lesse precious, because it preuailes not to health.

Also the bodyes of the wicked lye in the graue vntill the day of iudgement, without any paine, which is Gods great mercy.

be, first, because this punishment is spirituall, and hath in it the death of the soule by punishing sinne with sinne. Secondly, other punishments haue with them desire of release, so hath not this. Thirdly, it is an high ready way to that vnpardonable sinne, Marke 3, 29. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all other punishments may be and are inflicted though not without paine, yet without sinne: but in this, there is alwaies an addition of sin, both of greater corruption and guilt, and withall a greater desert of punishment. Fiftly, it is the peculiar marke and note of the childe of perdition, as a broken and contrite spirit, is a sure note of the childe of God, Rom. 11, 5. Ps. 51, 19. Sixtly, it doth in the end most certainly bring men, not onely to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall destruction, but to eternall death, Deut. 2, 30. Ro. 2, 5. 1 Sam. 2, 25. Rom. 9, 17. Lastly, both some of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens haue acknowledged the truth of this, as <hi>Sophocles</hi> in <hi>Aiax,</hi> &amp; some of the Iewish Rabbins, as <hi>Rabbi Kimchi,</hi> for so much Maister <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> testifieth in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary vpon this Text.</p>

Thirdly, it admonisheth all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to beware of this punishment, to feare it long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it come, and to shun all such meanes and wayes, by which men vse to fall into it: as first, ignorance of Gods

Lastly, when neither Gods seuerity can terrifie, nor his kindnesse mollifie the heart, being like the foole spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of by <hi>Salomon,</hi> which though he should be brayed in a Mortar, yet will learne no wisedome; or like restiue wel-fed iades which spurne against their feeder, Deut. 32, 15,</p>

                     <p>First, it is expresly saide, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> hardened his heart, Exodus 8, 15. <hi>When Pharaoh saw that hee had rest, be hardened his heart or made it heauy.</hi> Againe, it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Prophet <hi>Hosea,</hi> Chap. 13. verse 9. <hi>O Israel, thy destruction is of thy selfe;</hi> which proueth plainely men to bee the proper causes of all the euill that commeth to them, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this world, or in the next. Lastly, in Mat. 13, 15. and Acts 28, 27. The blame of hardening is laide vpon the vngodly them selues, who winked with their eyes, least they should see: hereby giuing vs to vnderstand, that those thinges which they saw against their wils, they made as though they did not know them, they saw and would not see, they were wilfully blinded, their owne peruersenesse &amp; corruption is the cause of their blindnesse in soule, and of hardnesse of heart, Mat. 23, 37.

                     <p>No, not so, this will not follow; hee is the author of the iudgement, but not of the sinne. There bee two things to be considered in hardnesse of heart. The first is, <hi>apostasia,</hi> the repugnancy or aberration from the will of God: this God neither willeth, approueth, nor worketh; but abhorreth and punisheth it, as comming from Sathan and from the corruption of mens harts, and being contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his image and worde. The other is <hi>antimisthia, Rom.</hi> 1, 27. the recompence or iudgement which is executed, when a sinner that was blinde and obstinate before, is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indurate and blinded, as a reward due to his contempt of God. Of this punishment and due recompence, God is the authour and cause; for it is a iust thing with God, to<note place="margin">Sin is of God as a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, not as an offence: as a retribution, but not as a transgrescion.</note> punish sin with sinne, lesser with greater, former with lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sinnes. All punishment being an act of iustice is good. Therefore sinne as it is a punishment commeth from God, and not as it is a transgression, for so it proceeds from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than and the wicked. Thus <hi>Augustine</hi> teacheth, <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> (sayeth he) hardneth himselfe, <hi>libero arbitrio,</hi> and God har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened him, <hi>iusto suo indicie:</hi> againe, God hardeneth not as an euill auth our, but as a righteous iudge, who though hee doeth not instill any sinne into the creature, nor make his hearte hard or blinde, which before did see and was soft: yet hee doth not tame and soften them; and he is sayed to harden whome he doth not mollifie. Yet he doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forsake the sinner, which had before forsaken him, depriuing him of his grace, but also deliuereth him vp to Sathan and his owne malice, to be ruled thereby; as a malefactour

riot, and excesse: or else, by couetousnesse and vsury, cruelty, and oppression.

Cor. 11, 24. Christ a rocke of offence, 1 Pet. 2, 7. a Table a place of safety and security, of mirth and friendship, to be a snare and trap, and an occasion of ruine.

See Psal. 37, 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. Let God alone with them, and bee not troubled about them. Fourthly, it makes much for the consolation of the godly, to whom not onely things desirable &amp; good, but euen hard, vnhappy, bitter, and deadly things, shall turne and become wholesome and good; as sickenesse, weakenesse, pouerty, imprisonment, banishment, infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and death, &amp;c. All things shall worke together for good to such as loue God, Rom. 8, 28. The reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ by his crosse, hath sanctified the crosses of the faithfull, and pronounced them blessed which mourn

                     <p>The blindnesse of vnderstanding in Heauenlie things, [<hi>Let their eyes be darkned.</hi>] This is a speech borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed from the body, and applied vnto the minde, which is (as it were) the eye vnto the soule. The darkening of this eie, signifies the taking away of vnderstanding from the Iewes, making them witlesse and blockish, that they might see no more in the matters of God, and of salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then a blinde man can see at noone day in worldlie matters.</p>

                     <p>To bee depriued of the vse of vnderstanding in<note place="margin">Doctrins.</note> things pertaining to God, is a dreadfull iudgment. The proofe heereof, is from Deuter. 28, 28, 29. where GOD threatneth the disobedient to his Lawe, to smite them with blindnesse and with astonishment of heart, that plaine and easie, and familiar matters should be as harde and obscure vnto them, as the Sunne is darkesome vnto him that lacketh his sight. Example of this iudgement, we haue first in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who hauing disobeyed Gods warnings, bidding him let the people go; and after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and most sharpe plagues, hauing hardned his heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Gods knowne will, was stricken iustly of GOD with such a spirituall madnesse, as hee was not able to perceiue it to be a sinfull and hurtfull thing vnto him, to keepe the children of <hi>Israel</hi> still in his land; but after hee had let them go, he wold needs obstinately follow them
<pb n="903" facs="tcp:20835:448"/>
vnto the red Sea, which was the destruction of him and his people. Likewise, the Pharisies had their mindes so darkened of God, as they could not discerne any sinne or danger, in putting to death Iesus, though they had often felt that he had done them no euill at al, but much good, and in their presence had many wayes and manifestly witnessed (by his life, doctrine, patience, myracles) both the innocency of his manhood, &amp; the truth of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. A certaine shadow of this iudgement, we haue set forth in the Sodomites, Gen. 19, 11. who being smit with blindnesse, did in the day-light euen grope after the doore of <hi>Lot</hi> his house. If wee do account it a verie great euill to haue the eyes of our bodie put out, then to bee depriued of the light of vnderstanding, must bee a more heauier iudgement and calamity by how much the soule is more excellent then the bodye, and the benefit of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vnderstanding is greater and more necessarie then the profit of an outward and fleshly eye.</p>

Let vs learne from it generally the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame fiercenesse of Gods wrath against vnbeleefe, for the which he would so exceedingly and seuerely plague his owne peculiar people: More particularly let vs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue, that it is a plaine and and a sure token of Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation against any Country, to haue the chiefe props or staies thereof, eyther sore shaken, or wholly remoued, and to become like a tottring wall or broken hedge, for lacke of good lawes, wise Gouernours, the power of the sword, &amp;c.

Wherefore let vs speedily repent, and turne to the Lord with all our hearts, earnestly praying him to heale our Land, which is sore shaken by the losse of very many worthies in all professions and degrees of men amongst vs: let vs beware least we giue God cause to take vp that complaint against vs, which sometimes hee tooke vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Iewes by his Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> Chap. 57; verse 1. <hi>The righteous perisheth, and no man considereth in his heart.</hi>

                     <p>First, that it is a righteous thing with God, not onely to punish sinners, but to proportionate the paine and make it like vnto the sinne, as it were eye for eye, tooth for tooth, bloud for bloud, spoyling for spoyling, iudging for iudging, &amp;c. Touching which thing looke more vpon Rom. 1, 25, 26. This ought to awake sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which haue iniuried eyther God or man, that by hearty repentance they may preuent and turne away Gods righteous recompence. Secondly, from this word (recompence) wee learne another lesson, namely that blindnes and ignorance from God, hath not the nature of sinne simply and onely, but of a recompence, when it is inflicted as a due requitall for former sinnes: and in this respect sinne is from God as author, (to wit) as sinne hath the condition of a recompence, but not as it hath the quality of a trangressio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; for so it proceeds from Sathans suggestion and mans corruption. In sinnes mans euill worke in offending God by breaking the law, must bee seuered in consideration and truth, both from the good worke of God, and his iudgement by punishing offences righteously: which if Papists would confesse, (for they<note place="margin">Lutherans al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so do much wrong vs in this matter.</note> cannot but see it) they would cease to slander vs Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, by speaking and writing that wee make God the proper cause of sinne (as it is sinne,) whereas wee teach that in sinne beside the <hi>anomia,</hi> which is from man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, there is also <hi>antimisthia,</hi> which is the proper worke of God.</p>

Also in the Prophets and Apostles which had the Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie, &amp; a warrant by a speciall calling to curse others, it was in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> absolutely lawful so to do. Thirdly, in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke persons, as Magistrates, Ministers, and Parents, it is lawfull conditionally, that the cause of their curse be not priuate, but publickly (to wit) Gods glory. 2. that their affections be not partiall nor maliciously distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered with desire of reuenge. Now for the persons to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards whom imprecation must bee vsed, they must bee such as shew themselues to bee desperate and professed enemies to God and godlinesse, such as were <hi>Ananias, Simon Magus, Elmas</hi> the Sorcerer, the Traitor <hi>Iudas,</hi> the cruell persecuting Iewes. Thirdly, curses must bee vsed onely in such matters as do concern God or his church. And fourthly, not in those thinges that are eternall (for no man without peculiar reuelation, may pray for the damnation of any man) but in things which are tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, so farre forth onely as they may tend to the saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the parties.

choller, do banne or curse either themselues or others, their children or neighbours; and secondly, to warne them to take care of repenting for that which is past, &amp; hence-forward to take heede how they rush thorough indiscretion or impatiency into such wicked imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, least besides the taking of the sacred name of GOD in vaine, contrary to the third commandement, they do puli downe vppon their owne heads these verie curses which they haue pronounced with their owne mouths, as it is threatned in that verie precept; and as it hapned vnto one <hi>Charles</hi> Duke of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> who was slaine with a Gun-shot in the assault of a Towne, as hee had wished vnto himselfe; and vnto one <hi>Henry</hi> an Earle of <hi>Schuartz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh,</hi> who miserably perished, being drowned in a Iakes, according to his vsuall imprecations; and vnto two women in <hi>Germany;</hi> whereof the one to get credite vnto her words, did pray that if it were not true which she had spoken, that she might neuer speake, and she was made dumbe. And the other out of choller praying that the diuell would take her sonne, was presently possessed. And lastly vnto the Iewes, who by imprecation cursing themselues and their children, Mat. 27, 25. they do most wofully lie vnder it vnto this present houre: which shold be of force to admonish all men to auoide prophane cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; for such as loue cursing shall bee cloathed with it, and blessing shall be farre from them, as it is written in one of the Psalmes.</p>

                     <p>By a double <hi>Prolepsis,</hi> or preoccupation, where he meeteth with, &amp; answereth two obiections which a peruerse cauilling Iewe, might make against his former matter. The first of them is in this 11. verse, to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. What, shall the reiected Iewe alwayes remaine in vnbeleefe, and so perish? Or hath God cast off so manie Iewes to this end, that hee might vtterly destroy them? This question ariseth out of the former part of the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherein <hi>Paul</hi> had taught two things: First, that som Iewes then liuing, were elect by grace, and shall bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Secondly, that the most part of them were left in vnbeleefe, and should perish and be destroyed. This lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part was proued by testimony of Scripture out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> which told before that God would giue them the spirit of slumber, and darken their eyes, and lay a stumbling-blocke before them. Heereupon one might say vnto <hi>Paul,</hi> Did God this to the Iews that they might stumble and fall, that is, come to ytter ruine and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction? Which question, doth not inquire into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the wicked Iewes, what they meant by refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Christ, but into the ends of Gods counsell, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering them to be hardned, that they might be cast out from Christ and his saluation. What God did respect heerein, is now demanded.</p>

Secondly, it is against the plaine worde of God which saith, <hi>That he delighteth not in the death of a sinner,</hi> Ezek. 18, 31, 31. God forbiddeth vnder a curse, to lay a blocke in the way of the blind, to make them stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and fall; therefore it cannot be that God should take pleasure in the stumbling and fall of the Iewes, and to that end should blinde and harden them.</p>

                     <p>First, seeing the ends of Gods decree, touching<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> the reprobating so many Iewes, were so holy and good (as the calling of the Gentiles, and the receyuing in of the Iewes) therefore his decree ought not to be blamed but extolled rather, because it aimed at most woorthie markes. Secondly, we learne, that out of things most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, God can draw much good. As the vnbeleefe of the Iewes, and their fall from saluation, is a most grieuous euill; yet by Gods prouidence, there did spring out of
<pb n="912" facs="tcp:20835:453"/>
it two very good things, the vocation of the Gentiles, and the conuersion of the Iewes; which were not meerely exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by Gods bare permission, as if hee onely suffered these things (as a beholder or looker on) whereas nothing hapned without his will: but are the happy effects of Gods gracious prouidence, so wisely ordering and disposing their contumacy, as it gaue occasion of opening a doore of grace vnto the Gentiles that they might come in, and thereby at last prouoke the Iewes to seeke their owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution vnto their former condition. Thus in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the worlde, Gods prouidence and goodnesse draweth life out of death, and grace out of sinne, and good out of euill, as in the creation hee made light spring out of darknesse.</p>

                     <p>Thus, as if the Iewes were cast out of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Church, to make roome for the Gentiles to come in; hereof the Gentiles might surmise, that the receiuing of the Iewes should be their reiection and cutting off. For it was likely and might bee feared, that as the falling away of the Iewes, was the occasion of the conuersion of the Gentiles; so the conuersion of the Iewe, should occasion the falling away of the Gentile. Vnto which obiection, the Apostle answereth negatiuely, denying the obiection; hee strengthneth his argument from the lesse to the more, thus: If the diminishing and pouerty of the Iewes, bee the riches of the Gentiles, much more shall their plentifull calling be: if their fall do further the saluation of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, their restoring shall not hinder but further it more. For if God can doe that which is lesse likely, to draw good out of euill; much more hee can turne that which is good, to the good of the Gentile. Againe, a thing which is good (as the restoring of the Iewe) hath a proper inbred vertue, to bring forth that which is good; but a thing which is euil (as the fall of the Iewes) bringeth forth good accidental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, not as a cause, but as an occasion onely.</p>

                     <p>First, we learne the exceeding great seuerity and most sharpe wrath of God, in the great fall and misery of<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> the Iewes, his owne and onely people, for many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand years endowed with innumerable priuiledges, as in Rom. 9, 5, 6, 7. yet the greatest part of the whole Nation was fallen from God into extreame desolation. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son<note place="margin">Reason.</note> heereof, is the malice and infidelity of the Iewes stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing against Christ the Sonne of God, and his Gospell preached by himselfe and his Apostles, and calling them sweetly vnto saluation, see verse 20.</p>

                     <p>It warneth all men to stand in awe of Gods se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerity,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> and to keepe from sinne, through feare of his iustice, Psal. 4, 5. How will he spare thee, when hee did not spare a whole Nation? how will hee pitty a wilde branch, which did cut off the true Oliue? Therefore feare him all yee peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, because he iudgeth without respect of person, 1. Pet. 1, 17. The second vse is to exhort vs to beware as of all sinne, so chiefely of vnbeleefe, which thrust <hi>Adam</hi> out of
<pb n="916" facs="tcp:20835:455"/>
Paradice, the Iewes out of the Church and out of heauen too, and tumbled them downe to hell, Reue. 21, 8. Vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe most dishonoureth God, most hurteth men, beeing the roote of all sinnes, and cause of temporall and eternall torments: therefore we ought much mislike it, and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily striue against it.</p>

As the whole nation in a manner departed from Christ, so in a manner shall the whole nation returne to him: the proofe heereof is in this verse, in the word [abundance,] and in verse 26.</p>

Lastly, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God is willing to pitty them, it behoues vs so to doe, and earnestly to pray to God for their recouery, and not to despaire eyther of our selues or others, beeing very greeuous sinners before God.</p>

                     <p>It serues to call our mindes from corruptible ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> to fixe them vpon incorruptible, to labour to bee rich in Christ, not to the world, as Christ counselleth, Mat. 6, 19. <hi>Lay not vp treasure, &amp;c.</hi> Secondly, to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then those in their good resolution, which for the riches of Christ haue learned to contemne the world, for they haue

                     <p>That the conuersion of one hindereth not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> of another, but rather much furthereth the same; as it is written of the Gentiles, that it shoulde much helpe their saluation, to see the Iewes generally conuerted. In the state of this worlde, the preferring of one often cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the preferment of another; but it is contrary in the state of grace. The reason is, because the more be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,<note place="margin">Reason.</note> and the more full the body of the Church is, they doc the more abound in mutuall help. As in an army amongst many Souldiours, one succoureth another; and amongst many trauailers, one encourageth another.</p>

                     <p>It serues to prouoke all Christians to pray and seek<note place="margin">Vse.</note> for the turning many vnto God, that they may be the stron ger. Secondly, to praise God heartily for such as bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of darknes to light, as <hi>Paul</hi> often doth for the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, whereof see the proofe in his Epistles to the Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Colossians.

                     <p>By a reason taken from his owne example, or from the end of his owne Ministery among the Gentils, which was, by conuerting the Gentiles, to prouoke ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Israelites to follow them.

Such as do not this, whatsoeuer they haue or do, they bring no digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Ministery, which is magnified not by titles and shewes, but by doing the worke belonging to it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it warneth Ministers to keepe their office from contempt, by flying licentiousnesse, idlenesse, coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, &amp;c. by preaching painfully, and liuing honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Thirdly, it rebukes such hearers as will not be refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by preaching, for they are a blot and blemish to the word and the Ministery thereof, as much as in them is, as if it were of no might to saue. Fourthly, it exhortes all men, euen as they tender the credit &amp; honour of Gods blessed Ministery, to submit vnto the Doctrine taught them: by this meanes they shall magnifie the Gospell, and cause it to be highly esteemed of.</p>

This proposition is illustrated and set foorth by the similitude of the last and generall resurrection, when the dead which lye buried in their graues, shall arise a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, euen as possible it is for God to raise the Iewes out of the graue of their sinnes. This proposition is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by an argument a minori, from that which is lesse likely, to that which is more likely, as thus: If the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the Iewes brought foorth so great a good to the world of the Gentiles, as reconciliation with God, then what shall their felicity be, but a reuiuing of the whole world, when both Iewes and Gentiles shall receiue the Gospell; then not Iew alone shall be restored to life, but the whole world shal be totally receiued to God-wards.</p>

Secondly, it was not properly the cause of the Gentiles saluation, but accidentally, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch as the Iewes being cast out, by that occasion the Gentiles were called to Christ; who could not be called till they were reiected, by reason that the Iewes malice was such as made them to contemne the grace of Christ, and to enuy that the Gentile should bee partakers of it. Neither would they enter, nor suffer others: as a Dogge in the manger, which neyther eateth the Hay, nor suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the Oxen to eate it; therfore, as by tumbling down the dogge, the beast comes vnto the foode, so by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting off the stubborne Iewes, the Gentiles found ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance both into the estate of Grace, and Reconciliation with God.</p>

to draw good sap out of the ground, and to disperse it into the stocke and braunches to make them fruitfull. Therefore what the roote is, such will be the branches; if the roote be sappy, and full of good iuice, it wil cause good nourishment to the tree, and plentifulnes of good fruites.</p>

Also, when they made a masse of dowe, there was a part for God, whereof were sweete cakes or Shew-bread made to set before the Arke: &amp; this done, the rest of their fruite and their bread was sanctified vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, (that is) the vse and eating of their fruite and bread became holy and wholsome.</p>

                     <p>For sundry good purposes and causes. First, that by such a ceremony, the Iewes might know and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that it is God to whom they owe thanks for all their fruites, as being his free guift; as worldly Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will haue their seruants to pay some peny a yeare for some great Lordship bestowed on them, onely to testify their dependance vpon their Soueraigne, and not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich themselues; so it it heere. Secondly, by such Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the holy Ministery of Priests and Leuits with their families were maintained: and there is such great, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifolde, and necessary vse of the Ministery of the word, as men are to vphold that, though vnto their great cost, Gal. 6, 6. 1 Corin. 9, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Thirdly, in all their first fruites were represented Christ, the first borne of euerie creature, and the first fruites of them which tise againe from the dead, whereby all the faithfull are sanctified to an happy resurrection, 1 Cor. 15, 20. Lastly, the first fruits were a type &amp; figure of the estate of the Iewish Church: wherein the Patriarkes, <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Iacob,</hi> and other
<pb n="928" facs="tcp:20835:461"/>
godly Fathers, were like vnto the first fruites, to conuay the holinesse of the couenant made with them, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the Iewes which came of them. And also in this respect they are resembled by a roote, which impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all the sap it hath, to branches; so the godly Patriarks impart the grace of Gods couenant vnto their of spring; where upon it is not to be doubted, but the Iewes which ly now as men dead, abiect, and without hope to see too, yet shall bee receiued to bee Gods people, and reuiued; albeit they are as it may seeme desperate, as men laid in the graue and buried.</p>

                     <p>The Iewes are spoken of as they come from <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and not as they come from God: howsoeuer naturall corruption be contradictory to the grace of regeneration, which doth qualifie and take it away, yet it may well agree and stand with the grace of the couenant. For as one may be borne leprous, and yet be a free man, when the Parents be such: so one may bee borne a sinner by <hi>Adam,</hi> and yet bee borne a Christian and a member of the visible Church too, because hee and his parents bee within the couenant of grace; which couenant though it bring with it, forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of that sinne which we draw from our first father <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> yet when it shall haue force, wee are ignorant.

                     <p>First, it teacheth vs what a great worthinesse it is to descend from Christian parents, because to such, all the prerogatiues of the couenant, all the immunities and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledges of the Church belong vnto them: euen as the
<pb n="930" facs="tcp:20835:462"/>
Children of the Iewes had right by Gods couenant vnto circumcision and other sacraments, to the sacrifices and promises. Likewise now such as bee borne of Christian parents, haue title to baptisme, the Lords supper, to the word of law and Gospell, and all other priuiledges of the Church; which is a fauour wherein in no wise doe partake eyther Turkes, Pagans, or Iewes, as they stand at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. And in this confidence it is that we offer our Children to be baptized, being branches of an holy roote, by bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the Couenant. Secondly, this serues to confute the Anabaptists which deny vnto Christian children the benefite of baptisme, as if our condition were worse vnder the new Testament, then the Iewes vnder the old, or as though the signe must be holden from them, to whom the couenant it selfe appertaines. Thirdly, it affoords mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great comfort vnto all such Christians as at any time shall be afflicted in minde for theirsinnes, to remember that they are vnder that couenant which promiseth remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes to parents and their children. With this very argument did <hi>Peter</hi> cheare the hearts of the Iewes when they were pricked with sorrow, for the killing of the Lord of glory. Acts 2, 38, 39.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, it confirmeth our faith and perswasion tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this maine mystery and truth of the restoring of the Iewes, in as much as they springing from <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> as from an holy roote, and from the other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches, as first fruites sanctified to God; it is therefore without all doubt, and a thing of certainety, that the blessing and prerogatiues of the Couenant made with the parents, shall flow and breake forth at last to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of very many of them true members of the inuisible Church, as now it causeth all our children to become members of the outward visible Church; for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is God to be prayed, that they may not onely assent firmely vnto and lay hold vpon the promises of eternall life by faith, but bring forth also the fruites of good workes by loue, without the which the parents piety will but little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit the children.</p>

                     <p>He bringeth forth a third argument to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the beleeuing Gentile from despising and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the reiected and vnbeleeuing Iewe. Hee had first saide that their casting off was to the great commodity of the Gentiles, namely the vocation of them to God by the Gospell. Secondly, he gaue hope to the Iew of their repairing, because they were an holy people, and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from all other Nations, by the promises and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of life which was giuen them. Now thirdly herea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soneth from the condition of the Gentiles, both that which is past (they were a wilde Oliue,) and that which is present, (they were grafted into the true Oliue,) wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon dependeth a double grace; one, that the Gentiles are made partakers of the roote of the Oliue: and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they doe inioy the fatnesse that commeth of the roote, that is, they haue communion with Christ, the Church and the Gospell. The summe of the argument is thus much: Yee Gentiles beeing once like a wilde Oliue, are now planted into the true Oliue; therefore doe not proudly boast your selues with the reproch of the Iewes. This argument is wholly contained in the texte, and hath two parts both expressed. One is the antecedent part in verse 17. The other is the consequent, in verse 18. which is enforced by a new reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> drawne from that which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd or vnhonest, because we Gentiles bare not the Iewes, but their roote doth beare and sustaine vs; now it were an vnthankeful and vnhonest part to disdaine that which doth support vs.</p>

                     <p>It is impossible that the elect should perish, Christ hath saide it, Mat. 24. 24. For the gifts of election, faith, and iustification, &amp;c. are without repentance, such as God neuer changeth and taketh away; but if the elect perish, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must God change, Rom. 11, 29. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore speaketh not heere of right and true branches, such as elect and faith
<pb n="933" facs="tcp:20835:463"/>
full persons be, which cannot be cut off; but of counterfeite seeming branches, who be such in their owne opinion, and in the account of the Church, but not beeing indeed elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and called to Christ; and these may and doe fall away. The ground and proofe of this difference we haue in Iohn 15, 2, 3, 4. also Rom. 9, 7. where is a plaine oddes betweene the children of <hi>Abraham:</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 31. where is menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made of Iewes inward and Iewes outward, in the Spirit and in the letter. And 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 2, 19. it is said that some were of vs, and some were among vs; the former remayned in the Church, the other did not, but plaide Apostataes and reuolcers, running to the enemies campe.</p>

                     <p>The doctrines from them be two; first, the promise of grace and saluation is not fixed or tyed to fleshly gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: the reason is, because grace commeth by regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration at the pleasure of God, and not by generation at the will of man, <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1. 12. 13. Godly parents doe conuay their corrupt seed to their children, but not their sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit: else all that descend of faithfull parents should bee saued, which is not so, as in <hi>Ismael, Esau, Cayne, Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, &amp;c.</hi>

                     <p>It warneth all children which come of godly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, to striue to bee like them in faith and vertue; as Christ exhorteth the Iewes, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8, 39. to doe the workes of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham;</hi> and <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 4. 12. to tread in the steppes of his faith: otherwise the piety of progenitours will not helpe: for, not springing from good parents, but beeing like them makes vs happy; the Iewes were of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and yet were broken off.</p>

                     <p>It may teach vs two things: First, that it is the office of the Minister particularly to apply the word to euery one, because things generally spoken may instruct, but doth not so much affect and moue, as when it is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to euery person, like a plaister laide to the sore, or a portion of meate meete for him that eateth it. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we learne that when the word of God is preached, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one ought to attend and thinke all that is spoken is spoken to himselfe; for while we post it off to others, it makes the word of God vnfruitefull to vs. Godly, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> went into the Temple to heare what God would say vnto himselfe.

<pb n="939" facs="tcp:20835:466"/>
saluation came from the Iews to the Gentiles, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred no dignity at all vpon the Iewes, but receiued all from them. Therefore it were very absurd and vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest to boast against the Iewes, which were to insult a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Abraham</hi> the father and roote of the Iewes; for in despising that by which a thing stands, that thing must needs fall, and it is very wicked vnthankfulnesse to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult ouer them, from whom we take so much good.</p>

                     <p>That it is a very vnreasonable thing for Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to deride the Iewes; for that is euen as ridiculous as if an house should boast against the wals that beare it vp, or the wals against the foundation which vpholdes them, or as a mans head or armes against the legs which cary them, or the coach against the wheele that supports it. Secondly, wee learne that vnthankfulnesse against Benefactours, is a very vncomely and filthy thing. The reasons heercof be, first we cannot abuse and scorne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by whom God hath done vs good, but that wee must needs scorne and deride God himselfe. Secondly, it is a blockish thing not to acknowledge them from whom we take good, and a wicked thing to requite them euill for good. Thirdly, it is a dangerous thing so to doc, for God hath threatned that euil shall neuer depart from the house of such.

                     <p>This lesson, that humaine reason is exceeding proane to pride and arrogancy; which appeareth hereby, that not onely no argument can be so sound and strong as to cal it back fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pride vnto modesty, but it will rather take occasion to strengthen it selfe in arogancy, by that which is brought in to humble and take it downe. This hapned here vnto <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle, vsing this firm reason, to proue the Gentiles ought not to be proud, for that they had bin once as a wilde oliue, strangers from Christ, but were now planted into the true oliue, and become Gods people in stead of the Iewes.</p>
                     <p>This reason doeth but the more lift vp the Gentiles in pride, who attribute it to their owne worthinesse, that the Iewes were reiected and they receiued. This shewes the wicked pride of man, (to wit) how hard it is to reclaime it and bring it vnto humility: for as other sinners haue their defence, the couetous pretend thrift, care of wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; the drunkard good fellowshippe, the wanton youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, the reuenger iniuries of others prouoking; so the proud person pleads his owne excellent parts and worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. And hence it commeth to passe, that fewe proude wittes are reformed and cured, because they are drunken with opinion of their owne woorth and goodnesse; which must bee denied and renounced, ere they bee pleasing to God, who loues the humble.</p>

                     <p>The great difference which is betweene worldly grafting, and that which is spirituall, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> nowe speaketh: they are both like in this, that there is in both an vniting and coniunction, betweene the stocke and that which is grafted into it, they become one and haue a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, the roote and branches. Christ and his Church be most neerely conioyned, so as the Church hath the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation and name of Christ put vppon it for his vnion sake, see 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. howbeit these two kindes of graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting doe disagree in these two things. First, in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="942" facs="tcp:20835:468"/>
of grafting, a good science and graft is taken and set in a wilde and barren stocke, as a pipping or pearemaine, on a crab-tree: but in the spirituall it is clean contrary; for there branches of the wilde oliue (as the Gentiles were,) are taken and grafted into the true tree, the body of the Church and society of the godly, this is good: but the grafts are vnfruitfull, barren, and wilde oliue trees, (that is) wicked and vncleane men: and indeede it cannot bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, for whosoeuer is found without Christ and his Church, (his body) he can be no other but vngodly &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed. Secondly, in naturall grafting the branch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates sap to the tree, that by the fat and fruitfull sap of the good graft, the barrennesse and wildnes of the tree might bee amended: but in the spirituall planting, the branch and graft giue not, but receiue iuyce from the tree. So elect sinners by the grace of Christ to whome they are grafted, be changed to bee like to himselfe, holy and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous as he is: and this to be the end of their incorporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into Christ, namely, to bee conuerted and beare his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, is proued by <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4. 23. 24. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 10.</p>

                     <p>No verily; some were grafted into the Church of Christ, by profession of the mouth onely: some also were planted into it by faith of the hearre; which distinction is proued plainely by <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 28. by <hi>Math.</hi> 7. 21. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 5. The former bee not altered from their wilde and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren nature by Christ, and therefore may bee broken off and perish; but the latter not so, because they passe into Christ, and by his Spirit are renewed to his owne glorious likenes. 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Two; first a concession, granting the thing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected so farre as it was true; Well sayeth he, it is true, the branches (that is) the Iewes bee broken off in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and this was done, not because God delighted simply
<pb n="943" facs="tcp:20835:468"/>
in their fall, but he vseth their reiection as a meanes to further the grafting in, and calling of the Gentiles; this Ideny not, saith <hi>Paul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second part of his answere is a negation, wherein hee doth deny that the worthinesse of the Gentiles was the true cause why the Iewes were reiected, and the Gentiles planted in; but infidelity, (because of vnbeleef) as if he should say, not for thee nor thy sake, but for their vnbeleefe are they cut off, euen because they proudly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused the faith of the promses and of the Gospell, (seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be iustified by their owne merites of workes, and not by the faith of Christ,) as before Rom. 9, 31 32. and 10, 3. And the cause why the Gentiles were ingrafted into the body of the Church, was not any dignity of their owne, but their faith whereby they rested vpon Christ alone for righteousnesse and saluation, as it is said of them Rom. 9, 30. and heere [<hi>Thou standest by saith.</hi>] Thus in few and plaine words are laide downe the right causes of the destruction of the Iewes, and of the voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Gentiles; whereof the one (to wit, vnbeliefe) is naturall and might befall both Iew and Gentile, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both borne in sinne and vnbeleefe. The other, to wit [faith] is a free guift of God, depending vpon mercy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and from the hand of mercy giuen to the Gentiles, who therefore had no cause to bee high minded, but to feare and be humble.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>What is the doctrine which ye gather from the former part of this answere, [they are broken off through vnbeleefe?]</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, that God is iust and most righteous in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning and casting away the reprobate, because how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer no man in Gods eternall counsell is refused for sinne, yet God in time doth not destroy men but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their ignorance, vnbeleefe, and sinne: so as man beareth in his own bosom the roote of his own ruine, he may blame nothing but his owne vnbeleeuing heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecting Gods promises most wickedly. Secondly, wee learne that vnbeleefe is a sin most odious vnto God and
<pb n="944" facs="tcp:20835:469"/>
dangerous vnto men in whom it raigneth. For as it cast <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradice, and kept <hi>Moses</hi> from entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the promised Land: So it depriued the Iewes of the couenant and promises of saluation. The reason why God doth so detest it, is first, because it robbeth him of his glory, quite taking from him the praise of his truth, power, and mercy, which in effect is to make no God at all, but an Idoll. Secondly, vnbeleefe doth reproach God, and maketh him a lyar, which is to make him not a God but a Diuell, who is the father of lyes. 1. Iohn 5. 10. Thirdly, because as faith is the mother of all good workes, so infidelity is the mother of all euill: for from thence it is that we runne into all euill, because we doe not beleeue the word of God; whereas other sins spoile God of his authority, the vnbeleefe strips him of his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence and very being. Lastly, vnbeleefe is such a sinne as doth violate &amp; deface the whole doctrine of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, whereas other sins are committed but against some one part or parcell of the word of God.</p>

                     <p>What profite are Christians to receiue from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and meditation of this doctrine?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It serues to informe vs in what miserable case the members of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> liue aud dye in; in so much as they do flye to the merite of their owne works for life and saluation before God, reiecting the grace of Christ by vnbeleefe, euen as these Iewes did. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it serueth to exhort vs Christians, that we neuer seeke otherwise to be iustified and saued, then by the faith of Iesus Christ. For if the Iewes fell from the couenant of God, and lost all their dignity temporall and eternall, because they set vp their owne righteousnes by workes, and would not seeke to be iustified by beleeuing in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ; how may we looke to keepe our dignity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and standing, if we shall refuse Christ through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity, and trust in our owne merites.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, it warneth vs aboue all other sinnes, to striue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst an vnbeleeuing heart: for whatsoeuer sinnes wee
<pb n="945" facs="tcp:20835:469"/>
haue, yet they destroy vs not, so we haue faith to beleeue the remission of them: and wicked men are damned not so much for committing sinne, as for vnbeliefe, because they refuse mercy and pardon offered. Not but that the least sin hath in it the merite of eternall death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. verse last: much more the greatest. But as the smallest sin shall bee imputed to him which is an vnbeleeuer, so not the foulest shall bee laid to his charge, which truely repenteth and beleeueth in Christ; as wee learne from <hi>Marke</hi> 16. 16. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. 16. 18. 35. <hi>Acts</hi> 10, 43.</p>

                     <p>Two, first a proposition, [<hi>be not high minded</hi>] set foorth by the contrary [humble reuerence of God, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent humility.] Secondly, the rendring of reasons to confirme the duty propounded. These be two, the one is taken from their present good condition, to wit, their free insition, or grafting into Christ by faith, [<hi>thoustan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest by faith.</hi>] The second is drawn from their future dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, if they should grow proud and carnally secure, then they also should bee broken off as the Iewes are. This reason should be thus amplified by an argument (<hi>a mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi>) for it is lesse likely that God would cast away and cut off the naturall branches and true Oliue (the Iewes, his first and peculiar people,) then the wilde braunches the Gentiles, which were afterwards planted in.

of this Scripture is, to perswade the beleeuing Gentiles in regard of Gods free and great mercies, also in respect of very great perrill, that they bee not puffed vp with Gods benefits and so waxe proud and carelesse; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be carefull, labouring day and night in godly feare to preserue their faith, and to keepe themselues in that gracious estate wherein they are settled by the faith of Christ.</p>

And herein is a maine difference betweene faith and all other graces and works of the Spirit, as hope, loue, repentance, &amp;c. that those doe not make vs, but declare vs to be the children of God, as it is sayed of loue, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wee are knowne to be Christs Disciples, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13, 35. 1. <hi>Iohn</hi> 3, 23. but by faith we are made and constituted mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Christ, and are planted into the tree of his Church, to become branches thereof. As good fruite causeth not a tree to be good, but is a witnesse of the goodnesse of the tree: So good workes, and all other good gifts doe testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie vs to be Christians, but faith onely makes vs to be such. <hi>For by faith we liue, Gal.</hi> 2, 20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1, 12. Whereas both our English Diuines and others, doe write that we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into Christ by baptisme, it must be meant that it is a sacrament and a seale of that faith, which regenerateth and ingrafteth into Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. for which purpose, reade <hi>M.

                     <p>First, wee are Christians by that which quickens<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> vs to God; but it is faith alone by which wee are quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Godward; for before faith be come, we were dead in sin, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.

                     <p>It confutes both the Papists who teach that the very acte of Baptisme makes vs to become Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and so doth iustifie, regenerate, and sanctifie vs: as also the phantasticall spirits, which taught that wee are the sonnes God before we beleeue. Secondly, it war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vs of the miserable estate, that the Pagans, Turkes, Iewes, and all Infidels which be without the Church, do liue in; as also all wicked men and hypocrites which are within the Church; who hauing no faith rightly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graft them into Christ and his body, therefore they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not in the roote nor fatnesse of the Oliue, but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly want Christ with his Spirite, grace, and saluation: in which regard they are much to be pittied of vs, and God is earnestly to be prayed, that such among them as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long vnto him, he would in graft them into his Sonne by faith. Thirdly, it exhorts all men that haue not the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of a beleeuing heart, aboue all things to labour for it, that they may be made one with Christ, and bee bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by beleeuing, Gal. 3, 9. For albeit faith be a guift free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bestowed out of Gods mercy to whom hee will, yet God vseth not to giue it to the snorting Christian, but to such as labour and seeke for it. Lastly, wee are by this doctrine called from pride and arrogancy, vnto hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of heart: for seeing wee become Christians and Gods children by faith, and faith comes not from our selues, but it is the guift of God; we ought not to boast as if it were not freely giuen vs, Ephe. 2, 8. 1. Cor. 4, 7. If faith both do spring from and wholly relye vpon mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, then the faithfull haue no cause of glorying, but to reioyce rather in this, that they know God to be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, Iere. 9, 24. Further, seeing faith findes nothing in man to make him accepted to God, (but sinne and death) and doth send men out of themselues to fetch righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse and life from another: Therefore the faithfull haue great reason to walke humbly before God and me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,

Secondly, it takes Gods glory from him, and giues it to men; and this is an abhomination, to giue his glory to any. Thirdly, it is an absurd thing to be proud of that which is none of ours; for we haue nothing at all, no not a crumme of bread or a drop of water but of free guift. Mat. 6, 11. Iames 1, 17. If it be a sencelesse thing that a stage player should bee proud of anothers apparell which he borrowed, &amp; must by and by put it off; how voide of sence should we be to be proud of such things as come without vs, nay for such things as God might condemne in vs, and vs for them? because wee eyther abuse or corrupt Gods guifts, and therby haue cause to be humbled in our best estate. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pride is a very dangerous thing; for it pulled downe Gods iudgements vpon Angels, and vpon Kings, (as <hi>Nabuchadnezar</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi>) vpon nations, (as the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes and Iewes,) vpon Apostles, as <hi>Peter:</hi> therfore pride is by all meanes to be eschued and striuen against, both by good meditation, and earnest prayer, to haue it mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by grace, if wee will please God, and prosper now and for euer.</p>

                     <p>An example to illustrate these two sorts of feare, good and bad, may be this, in the Sonne of a Iudge, and a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, both at once standing in the Iudges presence, sitting on the seate of iustice, they both are afraid: the malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor hating the Iudge feareth him, because hee hath a sword and power to punish him: the child out of a loue of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, doeth reuerence his presence, and dare not by any misbehauiour prouoke his Father to wrath.

                     <p>Verie many and strong reasons: First, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of God, very often enioyning vs to feare him; as heere, so in many other places. Secondlie, the great praise which God himselfe giueth to this grace, as that it is the beginning of wisedome, Prou. 9, 10, and 1, 7. The well-spring of life, Prou. 14, 27. Our Treasure, The instruction of wisedome, Prou. 15, 33. See Prou. 14, 26. and 16, 6. and 9, 23. and 28, 14. Thirdly, the precious promises made to them which feare to sin against God, that they shall be blessed, that they shall bee preserued. See Psal. 112, 1, 2. 3, &amp;c. Also Psal. 128, 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, such also are pleasing and accepted of God, Actes 10, 31.

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by meanes of this feare, Christians stand in the Faith, escape breaking off and destruction; whereas proud se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Christians lose that faith which they haue, &amp; their other graces, and at length the happinesse: <hi>For from him which hath not, shall be taken away euen that which hee hath.</hi> Such as liue awfully, &amp; in lowly reuerence of God, do maintaine their faith, and preserue themselues vnto celestiall blessednesse, as <hi>Paul</hi> here not obscurely telleth the <hi>Romanes,</hi> that vnlesse they did feare, they should be broken off (which indeede is come to passe) as all the world now perceiueth) as the Iews were for their proud

                     <p>Gods faithfull children consist of a spiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate part, and of a carnall vnregenerate part. In the inward regenerate part, there is good confidence, by reason of Gods goodnesse in Christ apprehended by Faith, yet the flesh or vnregenerate part, suggesteth continually doubtfull or fearefull thoughts and carnall infirmity, putting the godly in dreade and trembling, which yet is subdued by the strength of Faith. For, as a little childe which is set aloft on horsebacke behinde or before his father, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he lookes towards the ground and remembreth his owne weakenesse, is made affraide of falling; but yet he ouer commeth this feare, and is in good heart, when he thinkes that his louing father hath him fast tied to him by a Towell, or holdeth him in his hands: Or as a man set on the top of an high Tower, whiles his minde runneth vpon nothing but the height of the Tower, or what a deepe way he may fall, and that his fall will be with certaine daunger of death, it is not possible but his minde being vpon these things, must be smitten with horror. But when his eyes are turned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the barres and battlements which firmely staieth him, then he takes spirit to him, and puts away feare: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen so likewise the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="954" facs="tcp:20835:474"/>
of God, his most constant promises, and the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite merits of Christ, communicated with them by faith; then their feare is either laide aside or lessened, &amp; they are much comforted and waxe bold in God.</p>

Thirdly, howsoeuer that feare that engendreth perplexity of minde, and breedeth despaire of Gods goodnesse, cannot consist together with Fayth, the one destroying the other; yet that feare which breedes a reuerence of God, may well stand with the assurance of Faith, being a meanes ordained of God, both to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and encrease faith, because it moueth vs to earnest constant Prayer, by the which faith is nourished and strengthned.

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>First, the sinne of vnbeliefe (in the obstinate refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Christ and his grace offered so kindely and freely,) was the true cause why the Iewes were cast out from being Gods people; which shews what an horrible sin vnbeliefe is, of which a certaine Diuine hath truely written, that it is the grand-witch which worketh all euill and mischiefe<note place="margin">M. Perkins.</note> both to the body and soule of men in this life, and in the world to come. For it shutteth the hands of Gods bounty, that hee cannot giue good thinges; as it is written in the Gospell, that Christ could not do any great work because of their vnbeliefe, <hi>Math,</hi> 13, 58, also it openeth the hand of his iustice, and draweth down euen eternall vengeance as well as temporall; as it is saide afore, verse 20, Because of vnbeliefe they are broken off, and <hi>Reuela.</hi> 21, 8. which must cause men to hate this sinne, as they abhorre a Witch or a Serpent, and to striue against the same as against death hell, and destruction. Secondly, wee learne that though the Iewes being very grieuous offenders, as also very sore and very long plagued; yet their conuersion is not to bee despaired of; so they returne, repent, and beleeue, they may be saued, thogh through vnbeliefe they crucified the Lord of life. And withall wee are taught generally, that wee ought not to cast away hope, either of our owne or of the saluation of other, (howsoeuer great transgressors, and of a great time and standing in sinne,) so wee doe not abide still in our iniquity. The reasons hereof be, first, because<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> Gods mercies, and Christes merites, doe farre exceede mens trespasses, for they be absolutely infinite, so bee not our sinnes. Secondly, God hath promised grace and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation to such as returne to him, without exception, either of the kinde of sinne, or of the number, or of the time, but <hi>at what time soeuer,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Eze.</hi> speaketh chap. 18. also, <hi>O house of Israel returne and thou shalt liue Eze.</hi> 18, 20. <hi>Repent that your sinnes may bee done away, Acts</hi> 3, 19. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the Iewes were the greatest offendors that euer
<pb n="961" facs="tcp:20835:478"/>
were, (for they killed that iust one, &amp; desired a murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to be giuen them,) are not left without hope, so they returne: what good hope may other conceiue whose sins are not comparable to the Iewes, if they will repent of that is past, and hencefore liue godlily?</p>

And thirdly, it giueth comfort against finall despaire, to such as are out of heart with conceite and horror of their sinnes, because they may be many and manifold, being also most vgly; or for that they haue long liued in them: whereas these Iewes after abiding in their infidelity now a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares and a halfe, yet are raised vp to a comfortable hope.

Sin dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth a man when it is abiden in and liued in without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse or hatred against it, or eschuing occasions, and purpose of amendment: but such as turne vnto the Lord with all their heart, shall not dye in their sinnes: the mouth of the Lord hath saide it.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It is true indeed: from the power of God seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<note place="margin">Solution.</note> from his will, wee cannot firmely reason; for so wee might conclude that there bee many worlds, that the world should last alway, that men should not dye, that a man hath two soules, &amp;c. because God can doe such things. Therefore it is foolish in the Papists to inferre that Christ his naturall body is locally present in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, because God is able to do i:, vnlesse they could
<pb n="963" facs="tcp:20835:479"/>
proue that it were his will to haue it so. We doubt not of Gods power if once wee see any sure euidence of his will out of his word. It followeth by good consequence, God is willing to do this or that, therfore he can do it, &amp; it shal be done indeed. We haue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to consider Gods al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightines, not simply in it selfe as it is infinite &amp; vnlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but as it is limited &amp; bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded by his word &amp; wil. The Apostle then reasoneth well, that seeing God by his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer could conuert the Iewes to the faith of Christ, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it should be so, because <hi>Paul</hi> was assured by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies of the word (see verse 26, 27.) and by good sound reason, that it was the will of God to haue it so, verse 24.</p>

                     <p>That in those things that God willeth &amp; promiseth, wee must strengthen our faith by the meditation of Gods power and might, after the example of <hi>Abraham, Rom.</hi> 4. 21 also of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1, 12. 1. <hi>Peter</hi> 1, 5. <hi>Iohn</hi> 10, 29, 30. Gods power is the maine prop of his childrens faith. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, seeing the conuersion of the Iewes is attributed to the power of God, hence we learne that to repent lieth not in our hands. Therefore they doe erre which ascribe it to the power of their own will, in whole or in part: also such as bee conuerted, owe all praise vnto God for such a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull worke: and such as be not, to their owne endeuour must ioyne prayer earnest and constant, and wayte vppon God in reuerent and diligent vse of all good meanes.</p>

                     <p>Thus; God did graft the Gentiles being wilde O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liues, into the true Oliue; therefore it is more then likely, that he will plant in againe the Iewes, being naturall bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: (the Iewes being so called, because they came and were born of parents to whome the promises did belong, and so were not the Gentils.) Now in reason it is an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der matter to graft in a wilde branch, then that which was once a true branch, because that is beside &amp; against
<pb n="964" facs="tcp:20835:480"/>
nature: but this is agreeable vnto the order of nature, therefore more easie. Also there is more agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene a graft or science which was broken off, and his owne stocke, then betweene a strange braunch and the tree. Lastly, if we regard Gods counsell, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the wilde Oliue amiable, which might induce God to graft it in, or to take such paines, and be at such cost (as I may speake) as to take boughes from the wilde Oliue, to knit them to the true Oliue, that is, the holye Church of Christ. If then he did this, why may wee not iudge that he is willing to replant the Iewes into their owne oliue? Let all Christians then heartily pray to God that he wil hasten this happy work, and take heed lest by their dissolute and wicked liues, they be an hinderance vnto it; woe to vs if we be so.</p>

                     <p>How many things do you find in Scripture to be called Mysteries?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>First, the vnion of two Natures in Christ, his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and diuine nature vnited in one person, 1 Tim. 3, 16. Secondly, the coniunction between Christ the head, and Christians the members, Ephes. 5, 31, 32. These two are wonderfull great secrets, for reason cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them, either how the diuine Nature of Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immortall and infinite, and the humane nature of Christ being finite and mortall, should be ioyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make but one person, without any mixtion of substances, or how Christ and the faithfull should be so knit togither, as to be truly one body, flesh of flesh, bone of bone; there being so much distance between them, as betweene heauen and earth, and yet wee beleeue both these secrets, because the words teacheth vs so. Thirdly, the Gospel is called a mystery, because in whole it is hid from the natural man, and in part it is hid from the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, 1 Cor. 2, 7. Fourthly, the vocation of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. Ro. 16, 25. &amp; the resurrection from the dead; howe they
<pb n="967" facs="tcp:20835:481"/>
which liue at Christs comming shall dye, 1 Cor. 15, 51. are called secrets, because they cannot be known vntill the euents declare them. In the same sence, and to the same purpose is the restitution of the Iewes in this place called a secret, because howsoeuer the word hath now reuealed it, yet till then it was secret. Also in what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they shall bee restored, in what time, in what num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, these thinges are hid, till by the euent they bee learned.</p>

                     <p>First, to teach vs, that therein nothing shal fall out by chance, but all things shall bee ordered by Gods prouidence. Secondly, to stirre vp Christians to thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse towards God, in that he will manifest to them the very secrets of his heart, as Kings open their secrets to few, such as be beloued and trusted. Thirdly, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue curiosity and keepe men from searching the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Gods counsel and doings, contenting our selues with so much as God will haue vs to know, not desiring to learne, when God will not teach. Lastly, to bridle the arrogancie of the Gentiles, least they should insult ouer the Iewes reiected, reioycing imoderately in their owne election, and in the Iewes reiection. A better remedy of this pride there cannot bee, then to know and consider this secret, that euen the Iewes shall againe in mercie be visited and conuerted to God, &amp; therefore are at no hand to bee despised, but pittied rather, and prayed for.</p>

                     <p>It doth signifie, either that obstinacie in their vnbeleefe was not totall of al Iewes, but particular, there being euer and euery where, now and then, some of the nation that beleeued in Christ; or else that it should not be perpetuall, but for a time onely, at length to haue an end. And this latter seemeth better to agree with the word [Mystery,] for it was no secret, that some Iewes were faithfull, and receyued the Gospell, <hi>Paul</hi> before had taught that by his owne example, Verse 1. and by the prophesie of <hi>Elias,</hi> as verse 4, 5. and had saide that the Iewes were diminished onely, not abolished, verse 12. that is, a fewe of them onely were elect and beleeuers. But that of their generall and great blindnesse there should be once a tearme, end, and conclusion: this was not vntill now that <hi>Paul</hi> shewed it to be a secret, hauing himselfe first learned it of God.</p>

                     <p>[Comming in] signifies the Gentiles free accesse or entrance into the house of the liuing God, which is the Church of Christ; and by (fulnesse) is signified the whole body of the Gentiles, or an appointed multitude
<pb n="969" facs="tcp:20835:482"/>
of nations, which are heere called fulnesse; (as before verse 12. the Iewes are called abundance) because the number of beleeuers among the Gentiles should arise to a great company, so that publikely among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles there should bee gathered a great company vnto Christ, there being no nation or habitable country past by, which should not imbrace the Gospell, at least for a time, according to that prophesie in Psal. 19, 4. and that of our Sauiour, Marke 15, 16. and that testimony of <hi>Paul</hi> Col. 1, 6. and that Oracle of Christ, Mat. 24, 17.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That towards the end of the worlde, the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Iewes shal be conuerted vnto Christ, that they may beleeue in Christ, bee iustified by faith, and bee sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. This appeareth first by the testimony which <hi>Paul</hi> cites in the two next verses, which plainely fore-tell it. Secondly, by Reuel. 7, 4, 5. &amp;c. Which prophesie is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally to be vnderstood of the Iewish conuersion after <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> minde, because they are distinguished from the other nations, mentioned verse 9. And this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie is of things not already done, but to bee fulfilled afterward, as ye finde it written, Chap. 4. verse 1. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, heereunto we may ioyne that other prophesie in Re. 21. which wold be expounded of that most pure Church that towards the end shall be gathered of Iewes &amp; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, ioyned in a most sincere profession of doctrine, and excelling in such piety and vertue, as if the world were to be created anew: and not of the celestiall blessednes of the Saints, in the world to come, as may appeare by these reasons drawne from the circumstances of the text. First, he speakes of Ierusalem, (not glorified in heauen) but comming downe from God, and by his graee migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily purified in earth. Secondly, she is likened not to a wife whose marriage is already accomplished, as it must be in heauen, but to a Bride preparing and addressing her selfe to meete her husband, as it vseth to be in earth. Thirdly, tabernacles belong not to blessed Saints, which haue ended their warfare, but to Pilgrims, which as strangers, are to abide a certaine time the combate with such lusts as fight against the soule. These reasons are taken from verse 2. and 3, now the verses 6, 7. and 24. af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foorde vs more demonstrations, for in verse 6. there is a promise to the members of this new Ierusalem, which are athirst. Now the Iewes indeed beeing conuerted shall haue a very feruent desire after the sweetnesse of Christ, in whom they shall beleeue: but in heauen where
<pb n="971" facs="tcp:20835:483"/>
all fulnesse and rest shall be enioyed. How can there bee any thirsting or yet any fighting, where al shall be crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with victory and triumph? And how shall Kinges bring their riches vnto heauen: as verse 24. These with sundry other the like arguments out of the text, doe suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently conuince (in my opinion) that this Chapter is not to bee construed of the glorious condition of the godly in heauen, but of a Church which for doctrine and manners shall bee illustrious in earth; not infected with such errors and corruptions in life, as was vnder Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs raigne, nor somolested with persecutions &amp; tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which caused sorrow, and cryings, and teares, and death, as in verse 4. of which there shall be a cessation in the dayes of this renued Church, beeing blessed with great purity and happy peace. The consideration and beleefe of this doctrine should mooue all Christians to helpe forward this glorious worke, especially by earnest prayer to God for it, and speedy repentance for those their sinnes, which hitherto haue beene barres and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacles to hinder it. For as the execrable and most palpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble idolatry of the superstitious Romanists, crouching and bowing most basely before the workes of their own hands, adoring dead stockes, Images, bread in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, haue caused the Iewes to abhorre our religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and faith; the rather for that the Papists beeing nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to them, and the greater number, they measuring the whole by that large part, think vs all to be as great i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll seruers as they be: So the most leud and loose man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Protestants abounding in schismes, factions, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risies in religion, being miserably rent one from another in matter of faith, and in matter of fact, beeing full of murthers, thefts, rapines, rapes, adulteries, periuries, vsuries, oppressions, inhumanity, tyrrannies towardes them, and among themselues; prooue great stumbling blocks to keep the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> backe. For which scandals very many haue an heauy acount to make.</p>

The Prophets haue fore-told the Iewes conuerfion, before the restoring of all things, therefore certainly it must be so.</p>

                     <p>Here are two knots to be loosed, first shew vs how Paul calleth that a secret, verse 25, which beere in these verses hee sayeth was written before by the Prophet? if it were written and reuealed then it is no secret.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Doctrines of the worde are secrets to some when they are not to others which know them; also they bee se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets in part, when in the whole they be not secrets. So it fareth with this particular doctrine, touching the future and full restauration of the vnbeleeuing Iewes: though it was written in the Scripture of the Prophets, yet it remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as to others, so to <hi>Paul</hi> himselfe a secrete and hidden thing, till it was taught him, yea and after he had learned it yet stil to others which knew it not, it did abide a mystery, yea &amp; to himselfe in some sort, as in what manner, at what particular time, and by what meanes this vocation should be fulfilled. Thus what is not absolutely a secret, may yet be called a mystery in some respects.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>But was it not sufficient for the credit of this mystery, that Paul had affirmed it from the inspiration of the Holy Ghost? what needeth hee to bring Scripture to confirme it, his owne assertion being an Apostle was aboundantly enough?</p>

                     <p>It is true, <hi>Paul</hi> his owne assertion might haue suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently

authorised this doctrine, but for two or three e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciall<note place="margin">Reasons why the Apostles doe proue their doctrine by Scripture of the old Te stament.</note> reasons, hee doeth nowe (as aften heretofore) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale vnto Scriptures, repeating his wonted words (as it is written.) His reasons bee these; First, to manifest and make good that which in his defence before King <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi> hee had spoken, that hee did witnesse no other thinges then those which the Prophets did say should come, <hi>Acts</hi> 26, 22. Secondly, to preuent and put by the offence of the Iewes, that they might not be scandalized and grieued with the doctrine of the Gospell, wherein they should ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly behold a great and full agreement between it and the Gospell. Thirdly, to commend the vse of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that it alone is a perfect rule of faith and manners &amp; all-sufficient alone to demonstrate and proue all doctrines touching saluation; so as we neede not for this purpose au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority humane, or traditions of the Church and vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word.</p>

                     <p>First, the great proportion and harmony or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent which is betweene the Propheticall and Apostolicall writings. Nothing in the new Testament is taught to be beleeued vnto saluation, which is not fore-told and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shewed in the olde; nothing promised in the old, which hath not the acomplishment in the new, so as the bookes of Euangelists and Apostles, bee as it were commentaries of the Prophets, as the Prophets be interpreters of <hi>Moses.</hi> The new Testament is the illustration of the old, as the old is the shadowing of the new: both bee but one word, and one Scripture, as there is but one faith, one Church; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, fanaticall and fantasticall men, as Marcionites, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees and others do dreame. Secondly, we learne that neither preachers publikely, for doctrine &amp; matter of faith do teach ought which they cannot auouch and make good by authority of Scripture; nor the people embrace as truth of God vnto their saluation, ought, which cannot bee she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed

them to be contained in the written worde, eyther for words expresly, or for matter and meaning. If any<note place="margin">We must o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise iudge of the canonicall Scripture, then Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like authors.</note> thing in the matter of Faith and saluation be saide or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged without authority of Scripture, it may be reiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the same facility as it was alledged, saith an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Father. Whatsoeuer is necessary, is manifest (sayth <hi>Augustine.</hi>) Againe, If I reade it not in the Canonicall Scripture, I will not beleeue it.</p>

The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Text or sentence, taken out of the Prophet Esay, ch. 59. v. 20, there is a little alteration in the words, for in Esay it is, [<hi>The deliuerer shall come to Syon:</hi>] in <hi>Paul</hi> (follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing the translation of the <hi>Septuagint</hi>) it is, [<hi>Shall come out of Syon.</hi>] This difference may thus be reconciled, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>

                        </hi> is by the Notaries and Coppiers fault, crept into the Text for <hi>heneca,</hi> as the <hi>Septuagint</hi> rendred it [<hi>For Syons sake,</hi>] or if we read [<hi>out of Sion,</hi>] then it hath relation vnto the progresse of the Gospell, as if <hi>Paul</hi> (doing the office of an Interpreter) should say, that out of <hi>Sion</hi> (that is, the Church of God, signified by <hi>Sion,</hi> where the Tribes assembled to worship) should come the Gospell, which should conuert the Iewes to Christ: whereas Esay respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the very time and instant of the first comming of the Messias, said (<hi>Vnto Sion.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>There is another alteration in the wordes, though no change in the sence; for whereas <hi>Esay</hi> saith (vnto them which turne from iniquity) which implyeth repentance, <hi>Paul</hi> rising higher, nameth the very cause of their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, namely remission of sinnes by faith in Christ. For none can turne away from sinne by repentance, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>God turne sinne from them by free remission: Or else, with Maister <hi>Iunius</hi> wee may say, that for his comming (whereof <hi>Esay</hi> makes mention) <hi>Paul</hi> setteth downe a
<pb n="975" facs="tcp:20835:485"/>
beneficiall consequent of his comming, which is remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sinnes.</p>
                     <p>The second authority is fetched, the one part of it, [<hi>This shall be my couenaut</hi>] out of Esay 59, 21. and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part out of Esay, Chap. 27. verse 9. This is al the fruite, the taking away of sinne. Some thinke it an allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the words of the couenant, Ier. 31, 34. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle applieth this place to his purpose after this sort. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God meaneth by free couenant to bee reconciled to the Iewes, (forgiuing them their sinnes) and hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde it by his Prophet, therefore there is no doubt of it, but it should be: in which regard, the Gentiles haue no cause proudly to despise and insult ouer the Iewes, but in feare and humility to preserue themselues in the estate of grace. If we will heare the application of these Scriptures more at large, thus it is: What God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised by couenant, the same must bee fulfilled, because God is faithfull, and cannot lye or deny himselfe, 1 Tim. 1, 2. Shall he promise, and not doe? But by promise hee couenanted to giue a deliuerance, not temporall from Babylonish captiuity, but spirituall vnto remission of sinnes, and eternall life: which couenant, he hath made not with Gentiles onely, but with Iewes; not with one or with a fewe, but with the whole people signified by [<hi>Iacob</hi>] opposed against [<hi>In part</hi>] verse 25. This Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of sending Christ, who is the deliuerer here spoken of, to conuert the whole Nation of the Iewes, and to saue them by forgiuenesse of sinne, is not yet accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. Therefore in time to come, euen before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of the world, it must be fulfilled: for one title or iot of Gods word, may not fall to the ground. This is like the prophesies of Math. 1, 21. Mich. 4, 7. Luke 1, 33. which are not yet done, therefore must be. For the Iewes being the chiefe part of the people, are but in smal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber yet called to the kingdome of Christ.</p>

                     <p>That there shall be a generall calling of the Iewes to the faith of the Gospell, before the second comming of Christ, as the Prophets haue fore-tolde it. It is not meant that euery one shall be saued, so as there shal not<note place="margin">Explanation of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</note> be any one beleeuer in the whole nation, but as the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Gentiles are saide to come into the Church because the most and greatest number shall imbrace Christ; so all <hi>Israel</hi> must be saued, and whole <hi>Iacob</hi> shall haue sinne forgiuen them, because this shall be done to the cheefest part, whereof the whole vseth to take deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
                     <p>For further proofe heereof, see the 21. Chapter of the Reuelation, which is a prophesie of this last and great<note place="margin">Ezek. 37. 1, 2. 3, 4. &amp;c.</note> vocation of the Iewes, as hath beene proued before. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which wee may ioyne <hi>Ezekiels</hi> vision, touching the restoring (by certaine degrees) vnto life, strength, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and proportion, the dry bones which he saw scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the fielde; which howsoeuer some by allusion doe apply to the resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the dead at the general iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet it is plaine by the text to be meant of Israelites being (in respect of spirituall life and grace, like drye bones and dead bodyes,) vnable throrough vnbeleefe to stirre toward God, but through the great and rich good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God to be raised againe by the Gospell, and made aliue to God through Christ, not all at once, but by some degrees, whereof their comming out of their desperate captiuity of Babylon might bee a type and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure. For it is Gods manner in types of temporall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerances, to teach spirituall and heauenly things, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning eternall redemption by Christ. Beside these things the counsell of the most wise and almighty God in the wonderfull preseruation of the Iewes, ought dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to be considered &amp; waighed of the godly: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as sundry very ancient people and famous, as <hi>Persians, Chaldeans, Assirians, Troians, Vandales, Lombards, Gothes, Saxons, Picts, Hunnes, &amp;c.</hi> are eyther quite extinct and destroyed, or else being seuered and scattered, haue not

Of all which what other thing are we to deeme and iudge, but that they are reserued thus miraculously of God against the time of their conuersion and saluation to come heereafter, in Gods determinate season. Of this iudgement and opinion finally are many both moderne writers, M. <hi>Caluine, Beza, Peter Martyr, Iunius, Piscator, Pareus,</hi> and our learned industrious coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman M. Doctor <hi>Willet,</hi> who hath written an whole tract of this argument: and diuers of the ancient Fathers and Schoolemen, as namely <hi>Hilary,</hi> and <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> and <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Aquinas,</hi> whose words are these: <hi>Vniuersi Iudaei, &amp;c.</hi>

all the Iewes shall come to the Faith, not particularlie some, but vniuersally all; as many beleeued in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning when the Gospell first was published, so verie many shall beleeue heereafter. The Meditation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, should warne vs 1. of courtesie and charity towardes the Iewes. 2. of humility in our selues, that wee despise not them whome God will honour. 3. of sound amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our liues, that we be no longer any occasion of their stumbling and auersion from Christianity, and that with daily and most feruent supplication we doe helpe their conuersion, that God may bee glorified in the free and mighty saluation of that forlorne people, and the kingdome of his Sonne enlarged: a deare thing vnto all which loue Christ.</p>

                     <p>Both what be the benefites of Gods Couenant of grace, and in what order: Christ himselfe the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer or Redeemer, whom except we receiue and embrace (being made one with him by Faith) wee can haue no part in his merits; as an house cannot bee borne vp and supported by a foundation, except first it bee close laide vpon it, nor a member takes motion from the body, if it be not knit to the body. The next benefit is remission, or taking away sinne, both guilt and punishment, by the death of Christ, whereunto is annexed imputation of Christ his actiue obedience, in keeping the whole Lawe for our righteousnes. For it is not enough to bee freed from condemnation and curse of sin, but there must bee title and interest giuen vs vnto glorification and life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, that we may be fully blessed, &amp; Christ may be to vs no halfe, but an absolute redeemer. Lastly, repentance or turning from sin vnto holinesse, which is sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and is an vnseparable companion of iustification, a necessarie fruite of faith, and a spirituall benefit of Gods free Couenant, so as they doe in vaine boast of hauing
<pb n="979" facs="tcp:20835:487"/>
Christ and remission of sinnes by him, which haue not forsaken their iniquities, and begun to leade a new life. Obstinate sinners which still abide in their wicked lusts, without amendment, haue nothing to do with Christ as a deliuerer and Sauiour, but as with a fierce Iudge. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we are taught that we haue pardon of sinne and sanctification by the vertue of Gods couenant and free promise, whereupon all good benefits depend, but this is effectuall onely by faith. For as no Christ, no recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God without the promise concerning Christ, the promise is vaine to vs, till we beleeue. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Papists teach corruptly, which say, that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties baptized, are purged and sanctified by the worke done, whether they doe beleeue or not. Moreouer, if remission of sinnes bee by free Couenant, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth of merite of Workes? For, if our Saluation stands in remission, then not in perfection of Vertues: if in the prerogatiue of Christ the Redeemer, and of Gods free Couenant, then not in the glorie of our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.</p>

                     <p>Two Arguments to prooue the former secret about the vniuersall restoring of the Iewes. The first is taken from the dignity of the Iewes being his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient people, set forth by the efficient cause Gods elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and his Couenant with the Fathers. The second is from the nature of GOD, who is euermore firme and vnchaungeable, and will not frustrate his owne electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and calling. Therefore it is most certaine, that one day the Iewes must bee conuerted vnto the Fayth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God cannot for euer leaue and forsake a people so

                     <p>By a preoccupation, wherein there is a secret ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection answered. The obiection is this; The Iewes are enemies to the Gospell, they hate and hinder the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and spreading of it, God hateth them; and howe then may we thinke hee will saue them, as you auouch? Vnto this the Apostle answereth by a distinction, thus: They are hated indeede for the Gospel sake, vnto which they are enemies, and for your sake whome they loue so little, as they thinke the worse of the Gospell, because you professe it. But in other respects they are beloued of God, because of the promises made to their Fathers and because of Gods election, which cannot be made voyde by their present vnbeleefe and resistance of the Gospell, because the gifts and calling of God neuer changeth.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim</speaker>
                     <p>But how is it possible, that the selfe same persons shold be both enemies, and bee beloued: to hate and to loue, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, and cannot at one time bee in a Man, much lesse in GOD?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Sundry answeres may be fitted to this question and doubt, to satisfie it. First, the selfesame Iewes may be hated &amp; loued of God at sundry times; hated, whiles they continue in vnbeleefe; beloued, when they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to the faith, as in verse 23. Secondly, it may bee meant of diuers sortes of Iewes, such as spurne against Christ, are enemies and hated; but the remnant beloued, which belong to Gods election, and do beleeue. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is true in diuers considerations: in regarde of their present minde to the Gospel, hated; bur in regarde of their elect Fathers, beloued and precious: but the fittest answere heereunto is, to vnderstand this not of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar men and women among the Iewes, but of the whole Nation which was reiected and hated for infidelity, yet not vtterly cast out, because of the Couenant made with
<pb n="981" facs="tcp:20835:488"/>
their Fathers: as the Riuer is still the same, although the water which runneth by, bee not the same: so it is the same Nation of the Iewes, because of lineall descent, though consisting of diuers generations, and of vnlike conditions.</p>
                     <p>Thus then the answer of <hi>Paul</hi> may summarily be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected: that if God looke vpon the Iewes, according to their present estate; as they doe not admit, but kicke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Gospell, he hateth them, and worthily aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth them: but as he considereth his people, not after their euill deseruinges, but according to his owne free election, and that promise which God hath made to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and his seede, God so loueth them, and in his time will vouchsafe his grace vnto them; because how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer all men be lyers, yet God remaineth constant, and altereth not his wil and counsell, verse 29.</p>

                     <p>No verily, God still remaineth one &amp; the same, euer like himselfe, howsoeuer things and persons are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten changed, such as he will haue to change, and at such time as he appointed their change. What God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to be perpetually, shall be so; and what hee hath ordained to bee mutable, shall bee altered; but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe varieth not, with him is no shaddowe by turning, Iames 1, 17.</p>

The reason<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> heereof is good, because the Gospell proceedes from God himselfe, as author; also, it entreateth of his grace and mans saluation, and is the worde of his Wisedome, wherein hee hath vttered his counsell for mans eternall happinesse, being a word of trueth and reconcilement. Therefore such as oppose and oppugne this word, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be but odious to God.</p>

If God wil take vengeance in fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire of them which be ignorant of his will, and do not know the Gospell, 2 Tim. 1, 8. how will hee torment such as by word, false opinions, writing, or sworde and persecution, be enemies to the Gospel? Secondly, this admonisheth vs whom we must account our enemies, &amp; how farre foorth, namely, not for our priuate profit or pleasure, but for the Gospel &amp; mens saluation sake: with such as hurt these, wee must haue irreconciliable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, so long as they set themselues against the Gospel, and do not repent.

                     <p>First, it warneth vs all herein to imitate God, to<note place="margin">Vse.</note> continue our loue in a constant tenour from Father to the childe, there being no iust cause to the contrary; as <hi>Dauid</hi> loued and honoured <hi>Chimham,</hi> when he could not doe his Father <hi>Barzilai</hi> any good, by reason of his old age, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 19, 38, Secondly, not to hate the wicked longer then they abide in their refusall of the Gospell, but as God and Angels receiue, loue and ioy at sinners when they conuert, so ought we men, <hi>Luke</hi> 15. Thirdly, that Children which haue had godly parents, shall bee inheritours of the same grace and loue, so as they be followers of the piety of their parents. If they degenerate, God will hate them as he did the Iewes which grew out of kinde, but if they bee like to their beleuing progenitors, they shal taste of the same loue. Lastly, seeing God loueth many of the Iewes, let not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians hate them, neglect or despise, or bee vncourteous or hurtfull to them; but dayly and earnestly pray for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion of such amongst them, as pertaine to Gods electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and couenant, prouoking them by our Christian and godly conuersation to come vnto, and to like of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
<pb n="985" facs="tcp:20835:490"/>
and not driue them more backwards from Christ, by superstitious vsages and corrupt manners, for which the Idolatrous Papists and carnall professors haue much to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to God, who will be a seuere reuenger of such scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals.</p>

                     <p>Go forward to verse 2. which hath a new reason from the nature of God, to proue his vnchangeable loue to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Iewes, because God himselfe cannot change his owne counsell. Tell vs what is meant by [guifts and calling,] and by [without repentance,] &amp; what is our instruction from this whole verse?</p>

                     <p>By [guifts] he meaneth not either corporall good things, as health, strength, beauty; nor yet naturall gifts of the minde, as wit, memory, &amp;c. nor worldly goods, as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, honors; nor all spirituall good things, as knowledge, gift of preaching, prayer, &amp;c. for these may be, and are lost, and taken away from many. Whereas <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of gifts which be irreuocable, &amp; once had, are no more lost; as elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the speciall fruites thereof, viz. remission of sins, iustification, faith, repentance, sanctification, hope, loue, perseuerance in grace, &amp; glorification; these peculiar gifts which flow out of Gods eternall predestination and loue: Also that calling which is according to Gods purpose, which is euer effectuall to the change and renewing os the heart; and of these it is written, they bee without (repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,) that is, immutable without any alteration. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance the cause of change, being by a metonymie, put for mutation which is the effect: for therefore men change because they repent; not but that these guists and others, failing in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, as things created be subiect to change, (God alone being absolutely without change, being sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and infinitly eternall,) but seeing God who besto weth them, will neuer call them back, hence it is they are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and free from change. For that which causeth repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and change, is either want of counsell and foresight to vnderstand things thoroughly; or of power, not beeing able well to effect what was well considered. Now in God
<pb n="986" facs="tcp:20835:491"/>
there lackes no wisedome nor power, for he knew al his workes, and none can resist his power; therefore such Iews as he knew before, and whom he gaue to his Sonne to bee redeemed and deliuered, cannot fall from these guifts and calling of God. This word then (without repentance) must not with <hi>Erasmus</hi> bee referred to the guifts and things themselues, nor with <hi>Stapleton</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther popish Sophisters be so taken as if God had no cause to repent of his reiecting the Iewes, for that therof came such a good, as the conuersion of Gentiles; it being <hi>Pauls</hi> purpose by this assertion, to prooue the calling of the Iewes: but this must bee referred to the fixed and most good and wise counsell of God towards his elect, such as he had spoken of, Rom. 8, 30. <hi>Whom hee predestinated, them hee called, and iustifieth, and glorifieth.</hi> In these the guifts and calling of God bee without alteration, inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as neyther Diuels with all their malice and might, nor the Saints with all their weakenesse and inconstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, can bereaue them of their guifts, and inward calling, because God the author and worker is constant, and so prescrueth what he bestoweth, as neyther he takes them away, nor suffereth his children to cast them away. Of which matter reade the Dialogue on Rom. 5. 2.</p>

                     <p>But howsoeuer there bee no repentance and changing<note place="margin">Mal. 3, 6.</note> of purpose with God, and therefore seeing according to his euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting<note place="margin">Numb. 13, 19.</note> purpose hee promised that the seed of the Fathers, as of<note place="margin">Esay 46, 11.</note> Abraham, &amp;c. shall be holy, hee will stand to his promises, and<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15, 29.</note> out of the Iewes will gather all his elect, (for this is his proper<note place="margin">Psal. 110, 4.</note> nature, not to repent him; his guifts and calling are without<note place="margin">Iam. 1, 17.</note> changing) yet God remaining constant, men through their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault may shake off their calling, and cast off their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap>, and so fall away from God, and from beleefe in him.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>For answere heereunto, first, this doth imply a contradiction, that the Saints should loose their guifts and their calling prooue temporall, and yet God abide constant. For he hath by promise bound himselfe to the elect, that he will holde his hand vnder when they fall,
<pb n="987" facs="tcp:20835:491"/>
that they fall not from him, Psal. 37. 24. and that none shall plucke his Sheepe (the faithfull) out of his handes, Iohn 10. 28. They shall neuer perish but haue life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting, Ioh. 3, 16. That he will not tempt aboue strength 1 Cor. 10, 13. Of which promises it followeth, that God beeing faithfull and constant, the beleeuers cannot by their owne folly and vnheedfulnesse quite loose (no not for a moment) their election &amp; faith; for then the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation should exceed their strength, &amp; they were pluckt out of the Shepheards hand, and they cease to liue vnto God (Faith which is soules life, being extinct) &amp; so not euerlasting.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, albeit our corrupt nature is so made, as it would goe backe, and easily of it selfe would fall away, yet the elect being vpheld by the power of God, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers cannot haue a will to reiect their calling, nay their will is confirmed to perseuerance: also faith brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth with it a perswasion, that God being our Father in very deed, will be our God and Sauiour to the death, &amp; for euer. And therefore, though of weakenesse we often take sore fals, yet he will not suffer vs to fall away from him. Lastly, sithence without perseuerance in Fayth to the end, Gods calling cannot truly be saide to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance (for calling and faith bee so knit, as they stand together, or fall together) therefore liuely Faith cannot be lost, no not by our owne default. For none wholly can forsake God, saue such as bee wholly forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of God, who hath promised the righteous neuer to faile and forsake them. Iosh. 1. Heb. 13, 5. And to shut vp (because this point hath beene elsewhere largely spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of,) it is not in vaine that the elect being weake, are commaunded to watch and pray, and be sober, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue themselues; to feare with humblenesse of minde, Math. 26. 1 Peter. 4. 1 Iohn 5. Rom. 11. For by these and such exhortations as instruments of grace, they are of the holy Spirit stirred vp to great and continuall fear, to keepe their faith and other graces, and by the mightie
<pb n="988" facs="tcp:20835:492"/>
blessing of God vpon the ministery of the word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, they are stablished and made strong to abide in the Faith. Of the fals which they take by ouersight or force of spirituall assaults, they haue a sight, sence, and sorrow giuen them, &amp; so rise againe by true repentance to walk on more steadily and heedily; for afterward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conuerted, confirme thy Brethren. This Doctrine, that our election, calling, and faith cannot faile, is verie comfortable to all such as bee well assured of their owne election and calling by the worthy fruites of faith, and testimony of Gods Spirit, it makes them ioyfull in Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations, and to glory in God, euen when Satan, sinne, and the world do most rage against them; because they know, that these spirituall and spightfull aduersaries do imagine but a vaine thing; they shal be no more able by all their wrestling and fighting, to breake off from sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation any whom God hath chosen to his kingdome of heauen, then could <hi>Saul</hi> with his Courtiers, hinder <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> from attaining the promised kingdome of <hi>Israel;</hi> and therefore with his wordes in their chiefest conflictes of conscience may say, <hi>O ye gates of hell, how long will yee loue vanity and seeke after leasing?

                     <p>It containeth the two last arguments, to proue the conuersion and saluation of the Iewes, ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing it neither to chaunce nor their owne merites, but wholly vnto the mercy of God, as the head-spring of all good gifts. The one of these arguments is drawne from
<pb n="989" facs="tcp:20835:492"/>
a comparison of equals, or from the example of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, being matched with a like example of the Iewes, ver. 30, 31. The other from the common ende of that misery, wherein both Iewes and Gentiles were wrapt through vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe: which is, not that they might perish, but to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster occasion vnto God to expresse his mercy.</p>

                     <p>Thus much; as ye Gentiles were not forsaken of God, when ye were vnbeleeuers: so though the Iewes be now vnbeleeuers, yet doe not ye thinke that they shall bee forsaken for euer, for they nowe are not woorse then you haue beene. Or thus, If the vnbeliefe of the Iewes was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of beeliefe to you Gentiles; then the mercy of the Gentiles shall likewise bee occasion of shewing mercy to the Iewes, that they may beleeue &amp; so bee saued. The pith and sinewes of the argument consisteth herein, that there is as much, or rather more force in that which is good, to produce a good effect, then there is in that which is euill, to bring sorth a good end. Therefore if the blindnesse of the Iewes (though it bee a sinne,) yet being Gods worke had so good an end as the conuersion of the Gentiles, why may we not thinke that the calling of the Gentiles, should helpe towardes the calling and saluation of the Iewes, by prouoking them to emulation and earnest desire after the same grace to enjoy it? as verse 11.</p>

better reading, for none are woorse to bee perswaded then vnbeleeuers; and the word here vsed, commeth of a word signifying to perswade. Also <hi>Paul</hi> in this chapter maketh vnbeliefe the cause of the Iewes reiection from God, as verse 20, 25.</p>

                     <p>What is here signified by mercy?</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>The cause is put for the effect, mercy for the gift of faith that commeth from Gods mercy; so to obtaine mercy, is to obtaine faith through the mercy of God: and [your mercy] in ver. 31. not that whereby themselues were mercifull, but that blessing of faith which Gods mercy had giuen vnto them; as before in verse 22. [goodnesse or bounty] doth signify a liuely faith, the fruit of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>

                     <p>What instructions are wee now to take from these two first verses of this text?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That the elect of God (be they Iewes or Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles) do obtaine to beleeue in Christ, not by fortune or by their owne merites, but freely through the mercy of God. The proofe hereof is first, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 16. where election and faith, which dependeth vpon it, are denied vnto, and taken from our owne merites, and attributed wholly to God and mercy; adde hereunto <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2. 8. Furthermore, vnbeliefe commeth from the free will of man being corrupt, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot ingender faith, for out of one fountain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not sweete and sowre water. Lastly, if faith come from our selues though but in part, then might wee haue some reioycing in our selues, but we must wholly glory in God, and not in our selues, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 31. Therefore faith in them by an effectuall calling, is the onely woorke of his grace and mercy, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 4. 5. 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It teacheth where to beg faith when we lacke it, and whome to thanke when wee haue it. Thirdly, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicteth such of errour, as in matter of saluation, part stakes and deuide betweene Gods mercies and mans free will; as
<pb n="991" facs="tcp:20835:493"/>
if it had some power to beleeue the promises, and onely needed some helpe of grace. Thirdly, it humbleth the pride of man, to consider that all that is pleasing to God and tending to eternall life, doth come without our selues wholly by the grace of God, 1. Cor. 1, 29.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Will not this weaken our endeauour after the getting and increasing of faith and other sauing &amp; heauenly graces?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>No verily, it may quench arrogancy, but it will quicken our industry, because the more mercifull God is vnto vs, the more wee are bound to doe what lyeth in vs to please him, Psal. 130. 4. Rom. 12, 1. Secondly, though faith come of God, yet our duty is to seeke, aske, knocke, labour and striue to attaine it: and the promise is to such.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That the vnbeleefe and contumacy of the Iewes, hath well deserued their breaking off from the Christian Church, so as God is iust, and they haue no cause to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine. Secondly, why the Iewes and the Gentiles might not beleeue both together, but by courses one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is a secret to be adored of vs, and not to be inquired into, verse 33. Thirdly, the conuersion of the Gentiles, followed the vnbeleefe of the Iewes, not as an effect of the proper cause, (for the Iewes in their disobeying, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no mercy to the Gentiles,) but as an euent &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent of Gods prouidence and counsell, so purposing &amp; disposing matters to the praise of his name. Elsewhere (that) noteth the euent, and not the moouing of the finall cause, 1. Cor. 12. Acts 1, 2.</p>

                     <p>God hath equally shut vp both Iew and Gentile (as it were in a prison) to this ende, that the elect among them might equally obtaine mercy vnto saluation.</p>

hearts, (for God is not the author of sinne,) nor yet one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by suffering men to be blinded with ignorance, and to become vnbeleeuers, or by withdrawing the Spirite and word of faith from men, and by declaring and conuicting men of infidelity, in which sence the Scripture is saide to shut vp men vnder sinne, Gal. 3, 22. because sinne is reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the law, Rom. 3, 20. But God as a righteous Iudge deliuering men vp to blindnesse and hardnesse of heart, doth hold the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fast fettered in the ghiues of their vnbeleef. Like as a Iudge doth inflict imprisonment vpon offenders, and restraineth their liberty; so all men (till the time of their effectuall calling) are kept in the prison of increduli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the iustice of God, their sinne so deseruing to haue it. This is therefore a metaphor or speech borrowed from earthly affaires, and applied to spirituall things.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That God vseth to punish one sinne by another, wherein yet he is not the author of the sinne but of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, the iudgement is from God, the fault is from men; therefore let all men stand in feare of him, who can strike the Spirite as well as the flesh.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that the condition both of elect and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates by nature is alike, all being incredulous, disobedient to God, and miserable: and therefore none ought to bee puft vp aboue another, our case being all one; and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect beeing no better then others by birth, haue the more cause to praise Gods goodnes for caling them to the faith, and leauing others in vnbeleefe, which were no worse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> themselues were.</p>

This may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare to be the sence, by comparing this place with Ro. 10 11, 12.

Secondly, it is God alone that is able to open the eyes of such as are blinded by vnbeleefe: as none deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth the offender out of prison, but the Iudge which committeth him, so none can escape out of the Fetters of vnbeleefe, but through the mercy of God which shut them vp in that prison.

First, for that they are vnsearcheable, (that is,) such thinges as neyther ought to bee searched after, neyther can they bee found, Verse 33. by way of interrogation; and in verse 34. by the testimonie of the Prophet Esay, Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 40. verse 13.

                     <p>The wisedome of God in his purposes towardes<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> men, and in the administration or gouernment of men and their finall estate, cannot throughly and perfectile of vs be perceiued and seen into. As why God would elect this man, and not that man, <hi>Peter</hi> and not <hi>Iudas,</hi> both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alike corrupt: why for many yeares hee would make the Iewes his people, and not the Gentiles, and then the Gentiles and not the Iewes, by courses, and not both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, &amp;c. These things were such as euen <hi>Paul</hi> himself found too high for him. The Reasons hereof be first, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> cause the knowledge of God is infinite like to the wide and vnbounded Ocean, like the treasures which are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thousand fadomes shut vppe in the earth, and cannot bee fetched and drawne out.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, our vnderstanding is finite and limited. Looke what a spoone is to the holding of the whole sea, or a spanne to the measuring of heauen: or ones fiste to the griping of the earth, that is mans knowledge being compared with Gods knowledge. Gods knowledge is most excellent, and not onely first, for the immensity and largenesse of it, knowing himselfe and all things, but 2. for the perfection of it, knowing all thinges perfectlie; and thirdly also for the manner, needing no meanes of knowledge at all: and fourthly, for the celeritie of it,
<pb n="996" facs="tcp:20835:496"/>
in a moment knowing all. Fiftly, the certainty, it cannot be deceiued. Sixtly, the eternity. Seauenthly, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacie, being the cause of all, and enlightning all. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there be many things which God keepes and reserues<note place="margin">Reason.</note> as secrets in his owne bosome, and cannot bee knowne of vs, no more then we know anothers thoughts or the reasons of others doings, especially of the actes of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whose wayes are like a great deepe, saith <hi>Salomon;</hi> which if we cannot alwayes looke into, how much lesse into all Gods matters? As our bodily eyes, howsoeuer quicke-sighted, yet are not able directly to looke vpon the sunne shining in his brightnesse: so the perfect wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God by many degrees, doth exceede the most perfect and profound wisedome of man.</p>

Secondly, it may moue vs to consider with humility, the weaknesse of our owne knowledge, which we shall neuer perceiue how poore and simple it is, till we put it in the ballance, and compare it with Gods knowledge. As <hi>Peter</hi> the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter saw his owne vilenesse, when the maiesty and diuine power of Christ, appeared at the draught of Fishes; and <hi>Abraham</hi> beholding the vnspeakable glory of God, was the more easily brought to perceiue his owne basenesse, that he was but dust and ashes: and as the most piercing and sighted eye, will proue dull, if it bee set against the beames of the Sunne: so the best and greatest knowledge of any man (howsoeuer it may seeme much,) when hee compareth himselfe with others that are farre more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant then he, yet in respect of God it will bee found mecre ignorance and blindnesse, euen as darknesse is in comparison of the light: let euery man therefore as hee feeles knowledge to puffe him vp, so beat it downe with
<pb n="997" facs="tcp:20835:496"/>
this thought: O Lord, how little a portion of wisedome haue I in regard of thee.</p>

                     <p>Some take them to signifie one thing, the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of God touching mankinde, and the euents of those counsels, but the best is to distinguish them, &amp; to expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d iudgements of the meanes which God vseth in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position &amp; gouerment of mankind, acording to his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall counsels: in which sence the Hebrewes doe vse to take this word for Gods administration, as Psal. 9, 7. and 67, 4. Iudges 7, 26. Iohn 5, 22. By [<hi>Wayes</hi>] are meant the purposes and decrees of God, touching all persons, and touching their eternal condition, together with the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons why he doth this to that man, and not to that. And whereas his wayes be two-folde, either those by which we come vnto him, which are his precepts and promises, Psal. 112, 1. and 119, 1. (for as by the way wee are led to the City, so by the word of promise and commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wee are brought to God:) or those by which God comes to vs, which are the wayes of his prouidence and decrees of mercy and iustice: These latter are vnderstood heere, and these are tearmed [vnsearchable,] because they ought not to bee searched nor enquired into, and [vntraceable and past finding out,] because by no search they are to be found; as the way of a ship in the Sea, and the way of an Arrowe in the ayre, so the wayes of God cannot be knowne as touching the cause and manner of them, &amp; vntil they bee reuealed. That <hi>Ioseph</hi> was so exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> so aduanced in <hi>Israel,</hi> and <hi>Ismael</hi> not chosen when <hi>Isaac</hi> was, and Christ sent to redeeme the world by death: these are Gods iudgements which we may search, because they are knowne by the worde. But why <hi>Ioseph</hi> &amp; <hi>Dauid</hi> exalted, rather then any of their other Brethren: Why <hi>Iacob</hi> taken and <hi>Esau</hi> refused, (both being euery way equall:) Why Redemption by Christ, was rather wrought by <hi>Iudas</hi> his treason, then by any other meanes: Finally, why the Iewes a long time
<pb n="998" facs="tcp:20835:497"/>
hauing beene Gods people, should be broken off, and that in the time of grace; and the Gentiles at that time planted in, when they were grosse Idolaters, and why the calling of the Iewes is deferred so many hundered yeares; these and such like are the wayes of God that cannot be known nor ought to be searched, but are to be thought vpon with great admiration and silence, after <hi>Paules</hi> example.</p>

                     <p>First, it is the duty of Gods children (auoyding al<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> curiosity) to adore and wonder at the secrets of God, as did <hi>Mary, Luke</hi> 2. and the Euangelist <hi>Iohn, Reue.</hi> 5, 4. And the reason hereof is, both because strange thinges deserue<note place="margin">Reason.</note> to bee admired, and ignorance is euer a iust cause of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, for no man wonders at what he knows, but at what hee knowes not; therefore God neuer wondereth at any thing, and wise men wonder lesse then fooles, because they know more; and yet both fooles and wisemen must won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at somethings which they cannot know.</p>

                     <p>It serues to rebuke blockishnes in such as are not moued to wonder at the admirable waies of God. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the curiosity of others, who in steade of wondering and being amazed, breake out into murmuring and blasphea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the thinges which they vnderstand not; as many Papistes, Palagians, and Lutherans vse to doe about the matter of predestination and other high poynts, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is notconceiued. Thirdly, the prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of some who deride and iest at things which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perceiue: the worlde is too full of such Atheistes and mockers; all such must be sent to schoole to sober &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded <hi>Paul,</hi> to reuerence and adore things which bee aboue them.</p>

So much of Gods wayes as Christ hath taught, wee may, nay wee ought to learne, but we may not be learners where God is no teacher; nor haue eares to heare, wher God hath not a mouth to speak.

                     <p>First, it condemnes such curious persons which like <hi>Adam,</hi> Gen. 3. and <hi>Peter,</hi> Iohn 21. neglect to search what they may well finde and know, and desire to pry into that which they cannot know; these lose their labor and themselues. Secondly, it exhorts vs all vnto Christian so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, to content our selues with things reuealed, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting passe that part of Gods minde, which hee hath reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to himselfe, because he needeth none to be the men of his counsell, as <hi>Esay</hi> well speaketh. For as hee knowes all the counsels of all his creatures, and is sufficient to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be his own Councellor, hauing none to aduise him when he purposed to create &amp; how to gouerne the world: so it bootes not for any man to looke after those counsels of his which hee will haue kept secret; there is no more dangerous madnesse then not regarding that which wee ought, and may know, to molest our selues in hunting out what cannot be knowne.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That God hath absolute right and power in, &amp; ouer all men, so as hee oweth nothing to any, or takes ought of any; he may do to them, or not doe, what hee will, giue or not giue, what, and to whom, &amp; how much, as he pleaseth, being independant vpon any creature, &amp; free from all obligation which might oblige or tye him vnto any of his creatures. No Potter ouer his clay, or Lord ouer his vassals, can haue more absolute right and iurisdiction then God hath oueral things created: <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradice, or the good Angels which be in heauen did not nor could demerit God, or make him in least degree bounde to them, they giuing or adding nothing vnto him, but taking all their goodnesse, wisedome, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and whatsoeuer excellency from him; and that freely out of his owne good will and pleasure; as being himselfe of himselfe a most full perfection, and an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute most free Agent, himselfe before all thinges, cause of all things, vpholder and sustainer of all things, end of all things. As the Sea hath nothing from the Riuers, but they from it, nor the Sun takes any light from the moon,
<pb n="1001" facs="tcp:20835:498"/>
but it borroweth all from the Sunne; nor the soule bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes any life from the body, but the bodies life is from the soule, so is it betweene God and all his creatures. No Monarch in the world, Emperour or King, is or can be so absolute and independing as the soueraigne King of the worlde is; for they cannot subsist without their people, (as a King in royall authority) who by their mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, strength, and riches, doe maintaine the safetie of their Kings and Rulers, &amp; by their submission do honor them: but God had no neede of his creatures, he did and can for euer haue subsifted, and beene perfect and al-suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to himselfe, and of himselfe without them: and so not they without him, of whome they haue being, when they were not; and all thinges when they had nothing. This made <hi>Iob</hi> to say, that as mans wickednesse hurt not God, so his goodnesse did not profit him. And <hi>Dauid,</hi> Psal. 16, 2. that his goodnes or liberality did not extend to God, but to the Saints, which were of excellent Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, it might doe them some good, and none can giue God any thing. Whereas God calles for our affections, <hi>Giue me thy heart,</hi> Prou. 23. and for our goods, Offer thy substance vnto God, and hee looketh for our-thankes and praises, <hi>Render vnto me praises,</hi> Psal. 50, 14. Wee are to know that we giue God nothing, but what hee first gaue vs. Also by our giftes he may be honored, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be enriched, being an infinite perfection. And lastly, in our gifts to him, wee expresse our dutie, but make him no debter; for we owe vnto him more then wee do or bee.</p>

                     <p>Vnto what profit and vse are we to turne this doctrine touching Gods absolutenesse?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, it serues for instruction, to teach that God cannot do wrong, or offer iniustice to any, seeing he is in debt to none, and might do with his owne what he would: therefore, though he haue no mercy on <hi>Cain, Ismael, Esau, Saul, Achab, Iudas,</hi> or others, yet heerein is he not vniust, for hee oweth them nothing: nay, had
<pb n="1002" facs="tcp:20835:499"/>
hee denyed mercy to all mankinde, and appointed all the sonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> to endlesse and remedilesse misery, (as he did the Angels which fell) this plea woulde haue freed and quitted God, that none gaue him first; and therefore how can any complaine of him, sithence all was in his owne po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to dispose of them as hee himselfe listed? Let then all mouthes be stopped. Secondly, this exhorts the elect and godly, to great and continuall loue and thankfulnesse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes God, because of his gracious fauour, they holde themselues and whatsoeuer they enioy; they enioy it not onely besides and without their owne deseruings, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede directly against their merite, as being by guilt of sin worthy of the same condition with the reprobate; it is the meere goodnesse of God, who hath separated them and allotted them a better estate; for they gaue him nothing, they preuented him not by any merite or desert on their part.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Yet the Scripture often affirmeth, that Godrendreth<note place="margin">Doubt.</note> to the godly, according to their workes, Rom. 2. 6. and that hee doeth this as a righteous iudge, 2 Thessal. 1. 6. 7. 2. Tim. 4, 8. Therefore it should seeme God is not iust, except hee recompence the godly for that which they haue giuen him, see Luke 14. 14.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Whatsoeuer workes the faithfull haue, they bee Gods guifts, who worketh in them both the will and deed according to his pleasure, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. they be no otherwise called our workes, but as our bread is tearmed ours, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7, 11. because it is giuen vs; wee are they which receiue it, to vse it by Gods liberality, and as his blessing vppon our industry. So good workes being wrought in vs and giuen vs by Gods holy Spirit, are therefore named ours; and not because they proceed from our wil: which made <hi>Augustine</hi> to say, Lord looke not vpon my owne workes, but vppon thy workes which thou hast done in mee: and again, God crowneth in vs his owne guifts, not our merites: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, He doeth vs a double mercy, first hee giueth vs po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to do well, and then recompenceth and crownes that worke which we did well by his grace. Now God hauing
<pb n="1003" facs="tcp:20835:499"/>
freely promised a reward to good workes; hence he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led iust and righteous, not because he oweth any thing to any persons, but for that he keepeth his promise, which is the part of righteousnesse. Wherefore popish hypocrites and iustitiaries are little better then mad, which presume to make God obnoxious &amp; a debter to them by their works, as if they gaue him something of their owne, and so were vniust, except by order of iustice (not of clemency) he did requite, euen for the worthines of the worke. See Rhemish notes on 2. Tim. 4, 8. Heb. 6, 10. Lastly, heere is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed predestination vpon faith and workes foreseene, which bindeth Gods fore-appointment to the quality of the creature, as if it (being the supreame cause of al things) did depend vpon something in men which they should (as ye would say) giue vnto him.</p>

Of the conditions<note place="margin">Properties of our Christian Sacrifice.</note> the first is to be voluntarie in these words [the <hi>yee</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.] Secondly, that it must be of the [body] that is, of the whole man by a Synecdoche. Thirdly, a [liuing] one.

For Ministers be fathers, who be milde and deale gently. Secondly, the Spirite of the Gospell is the spirite of loue. Thirdly, the Children of God being of an ingenuous spirite be more easily led then drawne, and doe better like of meekenesse then feare.

Fourthly, it instructeth vs that the exercise of Christianity, is vnpleasing to our nature, and very painfull, insomuch as it requireth a death and slaughter, euen of our dearest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, that wee may liue to God: for there can be no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to God, without the sacrificing and killing of sinne; as the bodies of beastes were first killed and then offered: and as Christes body on the crosse was cruelly murthered: So (if we will bee true Christians) must the body of sinne be vsed, euen mangled, cut apieces, pierced, tortured, yea the heart-bloud of sinne let out by the exercise of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and mortification.</p>

Secondly, it exhorteth all which will haue any comfort or fruite of their profession, to set a work the Spirit of grace, which is in them to crucifie the flesh; that is, their remayning corruption, and to this end to take to them the sword of the Spirite (Gods worde) and to strike through the heart of sinne, by applying the threatnings of the law to it, and giue themselues to earnest prayer and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten fasting, to vnfaigned confession of dayly sinnes, auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding occasions of euery sinne, not sparing nor pittying our darling sinne: bee it sinne of nature, of custome, of trade, bring it neuer such sweetnesse of pleasure, or profit, or wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ship with it, yea though the reuenues of our sinnes, were 500 pound a yeare: let not your eye pitty it, nor your hand spare it, take it by the throat, strangle and kill it, that it kill not thee. As <hi>Agar</hi> the bond woman was cast out of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> family, so cast all thy slauish vices out of thy Soule.

                     <p>It must bee (liuing) that is, of our selues which liue and not of dead bodies of beastes, and to shewe the chiefe part of this our sacrifice, to be (Faith) whereby our soules liue to God. Also the more we do liue to God, the more sinne is killed: righteous persons alone are fit to offer this sacrifice, for they alone liue to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1, 18. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. vnregenerate men cannot sacrifice themselues to God, for they be dead in sinne, Ephe. 2, 1. they doe not liue by faith.</p>

                     <p>It condemnes such as by Gods mercies are the more emboldned to offend: it is a fearfull signe of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate wicked man, when by the kinde vsage of God he is made more wicked: as hee is a bad sonne which is worse by his parents loue. Secondly, such as forget his mercies: whereof good Christians ought to keepe (as it were) a register, that as they are tempted to any sinne, they may checke it with remembrance of some mercie, as <hi>Ioseph</hi> did; or as they become dull and slow to good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="1015" facs="tcp:20835:505"/>
they may quicken themselues with meditation of some mercifull kindnesse, and with thoughtes of some mercy, alwayes resoluing, that the more deepely they haue drunke of the mercies of God, the more they bee bounde to liue well and godlily: as our Sauiour saith, God will require much, where he hath giuen much. It is by <hi>Ezra</hi> to the Iew, and by the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> to <hi>Ezekiah</hi> imputed as a fault, that they forgat his mercies, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred not to God according to his great goodnesse.</p>

These two reasons can be of no force with an vnregenerate or euil man or woman, which neuer were partakers of his sauing mercies, no not of one crum of them, nor yet euer had their hearts framed by the Holy-Ghost to any sound care of pleasing God; but the godly which haue receiued but one drop of Gods mercie in Christ, and are led by his Spirit, these will be mighty perswasions to make them more vpright &amp; zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in Gods seruice.</p>

Pet. 4, 4. that wee should not run with the wicked vnto the same excesse of ryot, nor to be companions with the workes of darkenes, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes. 5, 7, 11. All which do teach vs, that in framing our conuersation, we may not imitate the fashions &amp; deeds of euill men. The Reasons heere of be these: First, Gods<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> people are a kingly Priesthood, Pet. 2, 9. therefore the fashions of worldly men do not become them. For, since the elect are made Priests vnto God, it behooueth them to haue the whole life, and all the parts of it wel ordered (saith <hi>Chrysostom.</hi>) The Priests vnder the Law might not touch any vncleane carkas of men or Beasts, neither may Christian Priestes meddle with polluted rotten lustes, such as carnall men wallow or welter in. Secondly, the lusts of the world are not of God but of the diuel, Iohn 2, 16. But Gods children in their baptisme haue by so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne promise renounced the Diuel and all his lusts, and therefore may not follow them, without running into the guilt of perfidiousnesse, and promise breaking.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the faithfull haue put on Christ Iesus, Gal. 3, 27. and haue him dwelling in their hearts by faith, Ephes. 3, 17. Therefore they may not put on the sinfull affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and foolish fashions of this world; for what commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion between Christ and the world, from which he hath redeemed vs? Also his Gospell and grace teacheth vs to deny worldly lusts, Titus 2, 11. Fourthly, God and the corrupt custome of sinners, cannot both bee loued; for if we loue the world and the things thereof, the loue
<pb n="1018" facs="tcp:20835:507"/>
of God is not in vs, 1. Iohn 2, 15. Iames 4, 3. The amity of this world is enmity with God, but Gods children are bound to loue God aboue all, yea alone, all thinges bee for him and in him, therefore they ought to abhorre the world. Fiftly, it is dangerous euen in this life for the godly to do after the customes, or to delight in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of sinfull men. <hi>Peter</hi> among worldly men learned to deny and sorsweare his Sauiour: <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> was forbid familiarity with <hi>Achab,</hi> Wilt thou loue him whome God hateth? 2. Chron. 19, 1. and <hi>Iosias</hi> by conuersing with, and conformining himselfe vnto an heathen king, loste his life, 2. Kings. 23, 29. The Israelites by framing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the Egyptians in idolatry; Exo. 32, 1, 2, 3. and to the <hi>Moabites</hi> in adultery, Num. 25, 1, 2. pulled due &amp; iust vengeance from God vpon their owne heads. <hi>Dauid</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Philistims learned to dissemble, and was in hazard: see the title of Psalme 34. Sixtly, the ende of the children of this world, &amp; such as fashion themselues like to it, is damnation, Phil. 3, 19. also see 2. Thes. 1, 9. 1. Pet. 4, 5. Lastly, the fashions, delights, pleasures, and lusts of worldly persons, doe in a short time vanish and passe away, as smoake or as a shaddow, 1. Cor. 7, 31. Therefore euen in this text they bee likened to a figure or image, (as also Psal. 73.) which hath insolidity, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soundnesse in it. Now true beleeuers which are borne of God vnto eternall glory in the heauens, 2. Pet. 1, 3, 4. must not imbrace thinges which bee fading and withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, of short continuance; it is not for such as be called to a blessed immortality, to glue themselues to vanities which haue no certainety nor durance.</p>

                     <p>But haue the godly any need of this debortation which you haue so strengthened with Scripture and good reason? it should seeme they haue, seeing Paul writeth this to the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Romanes.</p>

                     <p>Yea very much, for God doth nothing superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously and in vaine, he would not giue such an exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but on iust necessity: also by nature we are prone to
<pb n="1019" facs="tcp:20835:507"/>
fall into that from which God disswadeth vs. Moreouer the lusts and fashions of the wicked be deceitfull aboue measure, and exceeding pleasant to the flesh &amp; corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature, which seeing the godly haue not wholly put off (for they are partly flesh, and partly Spirit) there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had neede to be warned, and by many reasons (as by bits or bridles) to be held in from running after the manners of this world; especially, seeing they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not (there is a necessity in it) but liue together with me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of this world, therefore not without great heede and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, prayer and paines, can be kept pure from the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of this world: as it is no easie matter to keep them from beeing besmutted, defiled, or burnt and pricked,<note place="margin">Similitudes</note> which touch and handle Colliars, pitch, hot coales, or thornes. And besides all which hath beene sayd, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue the children of God from partaking in the fashions and spots of this world; this is not the least motiue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the truth and power of Religion and Christianitie stands heerein. See Iames 1, 27. Let any person haue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer so great knowledge of Scripture, and make neuer so godly a profession, yet if he ftriue not against the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions and spots of the worlde, but communicate in them and in his lustes (beeing like the vaine and wicked of the worlde) there is not a dramme of true Religion in him.</p>

                     <p>First, it serueth to reproue and vtterly to condemne<note place="margin">Vse.</note> their course as vnchristian, who make the fashions and con ditions of worldly men, the chiefe or onely square of their behauiour, thinking they doe well when they doe as they see others doe, and in their words, apparrell, diet, actions, are like the most and worst men: but if they haue some or many, learned, rich, wise, and worshipfull persons for their precedents and guides; then they blesse their soules in their euill wayes, and no body must mislike or speake against them. Herein they be like those Iewes mentioned in the
<pb n="1020" facs="tcp:20835:508"/>
Gospell, who fashioned themselues in their opinions, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and actions vnto their rulers: yea so farre as they cryed against Christ, Crucifie him, crucifie him, onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Scribes and Phacisies did hate him.

                        </gap> doe carry the common people after them, such as Princes be, such people will bee. Therefore it is to bee marked, that the Apostle doeth not say, ye may fashion your selues like vnto such in the world which bee famous for wisedome, knowledge, authority, wealth; but for biddeth vs to be like the world, without all exceptions. It mattereth not what sinfull men be for those thinges, though they shine in honour, and bee renowned for wit and policy, yet if they be secure and worldly liuers, we may not at any hand conforme our selues to them: but when any of you haue taken leaue to transgresse this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Apostle, it will be but a poore plea at the day of Gods wrath to say; thou thoughtst that thou mightst haue done and said, as such and such men gaue thee example. Therefore, doe not deceiue your owne hearts, but bee wise, do not look what others do which be euil, or what great men doe which bewray themselues by their talke and doings to be of this world. Walke not thou in their wayes my sonne: do not tread in the same steps: for they shall suddenly and horribly perish, sinking downe vnto hell in a moment, therefore choose none of their wayes: and albeit others wil admire and imitate them, yet feare thou that God, whose mercies hath elected and called thee to Christ, and doth now beseech thee not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme and fashion thy selfe like to the world. Secondly, heere is an admonition for all good Christians, to flye al vnnecessary and causelesse fellowships with vncleane li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and prophane worldlings, least by liuing familiarly with them, we do learne their fashions and maners: such as will flye a sinne, must flye all the meanes thereof. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and long experience doth assure vs, that our fashions
<pb n="1021" facs="tcp:20835:508"/>
and courses will be such as theirs be with whom we dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conuerse. Hardly or not at all shall we bee helde from following and allowing their practises, whose persons we do like and liue with. This is that whereof the word of God so often warneth vs: that as we shall learne vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightnesse and wisedome of them that bee wise and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, so we shall be peruerse, if we be companions with the peruerse and wicked. Such is the strength of sinne, as it easily poisoneth them that come neere it, euen like the pestilence.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, our sinfull nature is so apt to take the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion of sin, as flaxe and tinder to take the fire. Hence came those protestations of <hi>Dauid,</hi> Psal. 26. and 119. and that admonition of <hi>Paul,</hi> Ephes. 5, 11. which shoulde prouoke all men (as euer they do mind to obey this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of not conforming) to auoide voluntary companie of vaine and vngodly persons. Thinke with your selues, if such godly persons, so wise and well mortified as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> was, durst not ioyne himselfe to corrupt and carnall company, vpon feare to be like them: then howe much the more are others to looke to it, which by manie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees are not so strong as this holy King and Prophet was? Oh, that you would once beleeue, that there were great hurt and hinderance vnto godlinesse, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation with vngodly and vnrighteous men, whose words and workes shew them to be of this world, as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> language descried him to be a Galilean.</p>

                     <p>Whereas the Apostle dooth not write, that yee<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> should go out of this world, and leaue it quite, and shut your selues in Monasteries and Cloysters, Iohn 17, 15. Neyther saith he, vse not this world, for wee bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded so to do, 1 Cor. 7, 31. and God hath giuen ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thinges both for necessity and comfort, which hee woulde haue vsed in his feare: but saying thus (fashion or conforme not your selues to this world) Hence wee gather, that whatsoeuer is a property, guise, fashion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour,
<pb n="1022" facs="tcp:20835:509"/>
custome, or practise of sinners and corrupt men, (as they bee such) this is euen cause enough why the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God are to decline it, and to follow the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary course. <hi>Diogenes</hi> thought that he should doe best when he did least what the common people did: but sure that course of life is most commendable and acceptable to God, which is most contrary to the fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the world. The more and further that in our speech, gesture, attire, condition, or workes, we goe from the world, the neerer we come vnto true godlinesse. As Christian religion is the more pure and sincere the lesse it doth partake with the superstition of Antichrist: so our Christian conuersation is the more holy and vnblameable, the further it is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the customes and fashions of vnregenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Finally, seeing <hi>Paul</hi> writeth to men already iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by faith, and sanctified, yea in a great measure: this putteth vs in minde that this lesson is fit for the best Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians to learne and take out, and that it is a worke not of a day, weeke, moneth, or yeare, to flye the conformity and likenesse of the world, but such as men ought all their life long to be occupied and busied about; all time and care is heere too little.</p>
                     <p>This precept containeth one halfe of our repentance touching leauing of our sinnes, and is like those other precepts of ceasing from euill, Esay 1. 16. Psal. 34, 14. of destroying and crucifying the body of sinne, Rom. 6. 6. of mortifying our earthly members, and putting off the olde man, Col. 3, 5, 6, 7, 8. of denying worldly lusts, Titus 2, 12. of departing from iniquity, 2. Tim. 2, 19. All these differ not in substance of matter, but in termes; affoording businesse enough and enough againe to him that should liue <hi>Methusalems</hi> age. For what a worke and a doe about for saking of one foolish and sinfull fashion (I meane not of apparell, yet euen that way we can bee foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish and fantasticall enough, and as froward in retaining, as forward in receiuing them, but wicked doings,) how long ere one naughty vsage will bee left? what time and

                     <p>First, it confuteth such Philosophers and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Sophisters, who vehemently contend, that the mind remaineth still sound and vncorrupt, alwayes enclining vnto good thinges, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> speakes in his Ethickes; whereas the sicknesse of the mind may be easily bewrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by these thinges, namely, that in those most notable things that the heathen were stirred vp vnto by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of their minde, they had regard neither vnto the will nor honor of God, but were led with ambition and vaine-glory, being greedily desirous of fame and praise amongest men: and as their intent and end were both naught, so they failed in the manner, because the loue of God and of their neighbour, did not beare any sway in their actions. Secondly, this serueth to humble man, for that hee wanteth all power to apply his minde vnto good things, being altogether blinde in spirituall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Thirdly, it sheweth the great infection of sin, poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, defiling, and corrupting not the body alone, but the soule; not the inferiour, as the will, affections, and perfect senses, but also the superiour and principall part of man, the minde, iudgement, memory, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.
<pb n="1025" facs="tcp:20835:510"/>
Lastly, it sheweth how much the elect are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to the grace of Christ, by whom the whole hurt taken by sin, is cured and healed through his grace and Spirite.</p>

Secondlie, it exhorts all Gods children to see and feele theyr owne wants and weaknesses, and in the sight and sence of them to lament &amp; striue towards perfection, Phil. 3, 12, 13. to confesse our imperfection, is our best perfection.

                     <p>Seeing that the approouing of the wil of God,<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> is a speciall part, fruite, and effect of our renewing, as this particle [<hi>That</hi>] doth imply: it doth teach therefore, that none but regenerate persons (borne anewe by the holy Ghost) can loue and embrace Gods will by Fayth and obedience to it. All vnregenerate men, either tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough ignorance they do not know it; or if they knowe it, through malice of their hearts they hate and abhorre it, as heretickes and prophane men: or thorough hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie they may speake and professe well of it, yet they refuse to frame themselues according to it. As very many which are called Christians, are very forwards to heare the word, to commend the doctrine which is taught, to condemne things which are contrary to the wil of God, and to praise the Preacher of the worde; to make great shew of zeale, both towards the word of God, &amp; them that bring it, like to <hi>Herod,</hi> Marke 6. and <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Acts 8. too like others which liue after it, and to ioyne in fellowship and company with them; and yet beeing transported and cleane carried aside by some wicked af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, as vncleannesse, couetousnesse, wrath, pride, or the like; they neuer submit to the will of God to doe it, but most miserably faile in their practise, preferring and taking part with their owne corrupt will, against Gods will. Whereas the truely regenerate person, as hee hath his eyes open by the illumination of Gods Spirit, to see in part what the will of God is, so he striueth earnestlie to performe what hee knoweth, to beleeue that which God doth promise, to do what he biddeth, to leaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done what he forbiddeth, to feare what he threateneth, to reioyce in his comforts. At a word, to order &amp; guide his thoughts, words, and deeds, by the sound rule of his word, as he may please God in them all; as the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> professeth of himselfe, that hee was purposed to keepe the righteous statutes of God, and had sworne to obserue his testimonies, Psal. 119. And the blessed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle <hi>Paul</hi> (as he witnesseth of himselfe) desireth to keepe
<pb n="1028" facs="tcp:20835:512"/>
a good conscience, and to liue honestly, Actes 24, 16. Heb. 13, 18. So euery one of Gods children, according to the measure of grace, receyued in their new byrth, it is their hearts desire and constant endeauour to expresse in their actions that knowledge they haue of the will of God, and by their owne obedience to Gods will, as by a sure token and marke, their regeneration is sealed and made knowne to them, 1 Iohn 2, 4. <hi>I am thine Lord, saue me, for I keepe thy commandements,</hi> saith <hi>Dauid.</hi> Thus may euery godly man conclude, that God is his Father &amp; wil saue him, because he labours to please him, by liuing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his word: <hi>For not euery one that saith Lord, but he that doth shall enter into the kingdome,</hi> Math. 7, 21. Such for their firmenesse in the state of grace and saluation, are likened to an house built vpon a rocke, which neuer shall be remoued, Math. 7. 25, 26.</p>

                     <p>The onely rule of faith and manners, is the will of God reuealed in his word. The Shepheards voyce is that which the sheepe are to hearken to and follow, and Gods will is that onely thing which his people must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooue<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> of, beleeue, and practise. The reasons hereof be: First, because the will of God onely is good, it commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all good things, it condemneth all euill things; the will of all other creatures is so farre good, as it accordes with this: also, it makes men of ill to become good, for it conuerteth sinners, Psal. 19, 7. The second reason is, because this will of God is acceptable; there is nothing that we eyther thinke, speake, or doe, which is accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or pleasing to God, if it swerue from his will: to the which, whatsoeuer is agreeing, that, and that onely, he liketh, blesseth, and rewardeth: as it is written, <hi>Great is their reward that do thereafter,</hi> Psal. 19, 11. Thus <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Isaac, Iacob, Elias, Zacharias, Elizabeth,</hi> and whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer else were accepted of God, it was therfore because they beleeued, and did his will. <hi>Cain, Esau, Achab, Iudas,</hi> and others, that haue beene reiected of God, it hath bin
<pb n="1029" facs="tcp:20835:512"/>
because they reiected and refused his will. As parents and masters accept such children best which striue to do their will, so it is with God.</p>

                     <p>It must serue to stirre vp all good Christians more to loue and follow the will of God, which is so good, so holy, so perfect. Secondly, it must warne all such men to looke to themselues, and betimes to repent, which care not either to know what his wil is, or to gouerne or guide their wayes by it; for the more excellent the will of God is, the more iust and heauy will their condemnation bee which neglect it. Thirdly, it sharpely reproues such as make eyther their owne corrupt lusts, or the sinfull cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, or the examples of the times, or commandements of men, the patterne and rule of their conuersation, Mat. 15, 15. Lastly, it confutes the Papists, which charge the will of God with imperfection, as if it were only giuen for such as are rude, and not for the strong and perfecter men. Also which equall to it, and match with it apocryphal wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and traditions of the Church, as things to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with like affection and reuerence as the very perfect will of God it selse: as Tridentine councel blasphemously hath decreed and written. Heere also is an argument for the fulnesse aud perfection of Scriptures, because in them onely is found the good, acceptable, and perfect will of God. When I goe from the Scriptures, who shall tell me what is the will of God? saith one of the Fathers.</p>

                     <p>They be two: First the exhortation it selfe. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the explication, with certaine reasons annexed, to giue an edge to the exhortation. The exhortation hath a preface and the matter. The preface pointeth at <hi>Pauls</hi> Apostolicall authority, enabling him to command; and putteth on the Romanes and all other Christians, a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity to yeeld obedience. The matter of the exhortation consists of two precepts: First, that we bee not arrogant, presuming to vnderstand more then is meete, or to be too wise. Secondly, to vnderstand according to sobrietie, that is, modestly to esteeme of our guifts; the reasons are these: First from the author, because God is the giuer. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, from the measure, no one man hath all, but each his portion. Thirdly, from the vniuersality of receiuers, euery one hath his proper guift, there is none which hath not his talent. Fourthly, from the nature of the guift, it is no temporall but a spirituall guift, therefore no man ought to be insolent to despise others, but each to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="1031" facs="tcp:20835:513"/>
with his own grace and to vse it wel. The cause which moued <hi>Paul</hi> to this exhortation, was great emulation which burst out into contention, the Iewes would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the Gentiles, and the Gentiles despised the Iewes; such as had more worthy guifts disdained their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors.</p>

                     <p>What things are to be obserued in Pauls preface?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, that he giues not a counsell but a comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, for [<hi>I say</hi>] signifies as much as if hee had saide (I bid,) I command, I enioyne, as the manner of the Latine is to put (<hi>dico</hi> for <hi>iubeo,</hi>) so as this is no indifferent thing<note place="margin">Deus dixit, Gen. 1.</note> which men may doe or not, but a necessary precept which may not at any hand be omitted without sinne. We are further to marke, that whereas the Ministers of Christ may sometimes speake mildely out of loue, as in verse 1. so sometimes they may command precisely out of that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which Christ hath giuen, as heere and 1. Tim. 6, 17. 2. Tim. 4, 1. The second thing to be noted, is the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality of this precept, that it is to all and euery one; it reacheth throughout to euery member or officer of the Church whatsoeuer his office or guift be, there is none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted, be he high or low, learned or vnlearned, they are bound to submit themselues to this precept, concerning humility in vsing rightly their guifts and offices. If they be inferior persons and haue meane guifts, they haue need of it for to keep them from enuying them which haue bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: If superiors and haue more excellent graces then they haue need of it to keepe them from pride, and disdaining them which haue lesse. Lastly, whatsoeuer they bee they shall neuer turne their guifts to the profite of others, and of publike good, vnlesse they be modest and sober mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The next thing to be noted in this preface is, that <hi>Paul</hi> doth bring foorth his Apostalicall calling and function to warrant his precept. For (grace) in this place signifies neither the guift of holy eloquence, or power in speech, nor yet the guifts of wisedome as some thinke, but (by a Metonymie of the cause for the effect) it is put for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall
<pb n="1032" facs="tcp:20835:514"/>
vocation, as also Rom. 1, 7. and 15, 15. which is therefore called (grace) because hee receiued it freely, being put into this office when he thought not of it, yea he was a blasphemer and persecutor of the Church, Acts 9. 1. Tim. 1, 19. And this he doth to shew hee was no intruder or ambitious vsurper, which thrust in himselfe, doing more then he might well doe, in giuing precepts to Churches; as also to draw the Romanes, and in them all Christians to yeeld vnto the practise of this precept with all good reuerence and submission, that they be not found to striue and fight against the Lord Iesus speaking to vs by the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> whome to hearken to, and to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, is to receiue and hearken vnto Christ, Mat. 10.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Not to vnderstand aboue that which is meete, or not to presume to be wise ouer much.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>But how can any bee wise ouermuch, seeing none can haue too much wisedome, nor can vnderstand enough? how the shall any offend by vnderstanding aboue that which is meete? for we are bid to be wise as Serpents, Mathew 10, 16. Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians 5, 15.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It is true, therefore heere is not condemned the excesse of wisedome, (for God will haue his children striue to perfection) but the proud opinion of such men as challenge to themselues all wisedome and knowledge, who both are proud of that which they haue, and also ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate to themselues vnderstanding and guifts which they haue not, to the contempt of others, thinking themselues to know all, and to bee the onely wise men, none to bee like them, or fit to be compared with them. This attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting too much to our own conceite, and detracting from others, is the maine vice heere forbid and condemned, out of which (as out of a noysome roote) there doe spring 3. noysome branches, all comprehended vnder this part: as first an itching desire to inuent new doctrines, forsaking the beaten path, and simplicity of the knowne and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued truth, to runne into new and strange opinions. And
<pb n="1033" facs="tcp:20835:514"/>
that this pride and ouer-weening of wit, is the Mother of heresie &amp; damnable errours, both Scriptures, 1 Tim. 6, 3, 4. and lamentable experience haue confirmed to vs, that some to be thought wiser then others, haue hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed errors.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, a too great confidence of our vnderstanding, as if it were sharpe and quicke enough to pierce into the most secret thinges of God, which are vntraccable and past finding out. Whence it is, that many haue neglected things necessarie to be knowne, and fruitfull; to search out things which cannot bee sought out, and tend not a whit to edifying. Of these men <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, that such as search the maiesly shall be swallowed vppe; it is the wisemans counsel to content our selues with that which God hath commanded and taught, and not to seeke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to high things aboue our capacity. It is a needlesse mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (saith <hi>Augustine</hi>) to define that with daunger, what we may be ignorant of without danger: and better it is still to doubt of things hidden, then to contende about that which is vncertaine. The third branch is curiositie, when a man thrusteth his sickle into other mens haruest, rushing beyond the bounds of his owne calling, to run into and intermeddle with the matters which appertain to the vocation of other men, intruding vppon other mens gifts and functions; as King <hi>Vzza</hi> did vsurpe the Priests function, 2 Chron. 26, 16. and another <hi>Vzza</hi> put his hand to the Arke: as Romish Prelates not conoent to meddle with their owne Churches and affaires, woulde curiously busie themselues with other mens Churches &amp; charges, and secular matters, till they did arise vnto this height of tiranny which now they are growne vnto: To be short, as all busie bodies do, which leaue their owne places and matters, to intermeddle with that which in no wise belongs to them, contrary to the precept of the Apostle, 1 Thess. 4, 11. <hi>Study to be quiet, and to do your own businesse.</hi> This curiosity draweth with it infinite conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and much waste of time, which might bee better
<pb n="1034" facs="tcp:20835:515"/>
spent: as <hi>Seneca</hi> saith, Men spend much time amisse in doing nothing, but more in doing euill thinges, and yet most of all in doing other things which bee not proper to vs, but appertaine to our neighbors; and this is most properly meant heere.</p>

Secondly, a sobriety of the minde, which is modesty or humility (the mother of all vertues, and the preseruer of the minde in sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and temper:) as on the other side, pride is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouerthrower and ouerturner of the minde, leading men oftentimes to folly and madnesse.

This is to bee wise according to sobriety, as the next verse opens it, when wee iudge or thinke of our selues, according to the measure of our owne graces and degree, esteeming meanly of our selues, and much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of others, then of our selues.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, because it is God, who is the distributer of our gifts, 1 Cor. 7, 7. 2 Cor. 12, 6. Now it is certain, that God administreth his gifts both most wiselie and most iustly; therefore, let not such as haue greater giftes, be insolent, seeing nothing is their owne, but all receiued, 1 Cor. 4, 7. nor men of lesser gifts repine at others, for this were to neglect Gods administration. Neyther let any man hide his talent in a Napkin, or burie it in the
<pb n="1035" facs="tcp:20835:515"/>
ground, with the naughty seruant in the Gospel, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring that God will haue an account of his giftes, how they are vsed or bestowed. The second reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God hath distributed a gift to euery man; there is not a person in Gods family, but hath a talent commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him: one hath the gift of teaching, another of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting, another of ruling, another of being ruled: one hath a publick gift, another hath a priuate gift: as in the naturall body each member hath a faculty, so in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall body of Christes Church, 1 Cor. 12, 6. 7, 8, 9, &amp;c. Therefore let no man imagine that himselfe hath all, but let him know, that each hath his gift and function too, &amp; by this meanes, none shall despise nor yet hinder others, but each shall employ his proper gift vnto the common good of the rest.</p>
                     <p>The third reason is, that to euery man is dealt out a measure of Faith. Heere (by Faith) we are to vnderstand first the sound knowledge of Christ. Secondly, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects thereof, namely, the infused habit of iustifying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe. Thirdly, those gifts of the Spirite, which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany this habit of faith, which are therefore called by the name of (Faith,) both because Faith is the gifte by which all other are attained (Bee it done to thee accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to thy faith, Math. 15, 28.) Also because these giftes are conferred vpon the faithfull which belieue in Christ. A measure of this Faith, is set against fulnesse or perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which no meere man in this life can haue, because God giues it vnto none, Phil. 3, 12. but dealeth to euery man a certaine portion of faith, to some more, &amp; others lesse, as he himselfe pleaseth, 1 Cor. 7, 7. Heereunto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaineth the parable of the Talents, whereof fiue were committed to one, and ten to another, and one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Like as in our fleshly bodies there is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of giftes, our more excellent members, hauing more excellent faculties: so it fareth in the church, which is the body of Christ; there is grace giuen to euery mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of that body, but it is according to the measure of
<pb n="1036" facs="tcp:20835:516"/>
the gift of Christ, Ephes. 4, 7.</p>

                     <p>First, it must be a bridle vnto arrogancie, and a motiue to humility, to thinke that no one man eyther hath al gifts, or those gifts which he hath in ful perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but a certain measure meated out to euery ma, not by our deserts, but as it seemeth good in the eie of the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. Here also we may obserue, how the Pope doth walk by this rule, or how may we iudge him to be the seruant of Christ, who being but one man, yet arrogareth all to himselfe? he will haue the whole power of the Church, yea, and he will do all in the Commonwealth too, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone will be both a temporall and spirituall Monark, he in grosseth all knowledge into his owne breast, nothing must be diuinity and truth which he saith is not so. At a word, according to the Latine Prouerbe, he alone will bee <hi>Dominus Fac-totum:</hi> and after our common English saying, <hi>He alone will haue all the Pipes.</hi> This is farre from contenting himselfe with his own portion and measure, as other fellow-seruants do: hee may very well and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily be tearmed Antichrist, being so contrary to Christ, who himselfe was so full of humility, as Phil. 2, 6, 7. Iohn 13, 5. taught his disciples to be humble and meeke, Mat. 11, 29. whereas this Lucifer is the childe, nay the King of pride nay pride it selfe. Moreouer, seeing the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of Faith is dealt of God, hence it followes that faith is Gods gift, and comes not by mans will in whole or in part, Eph. 2, 10. Also the measure of Faith is diuers: there is a little or a weake faith; againe, there is a great or a strong faith. Let not the strong in faith be lifted vp, but thinke of profiting and encreasing their measure, after the example of the Apostles (Lord encrease our Fayth:) neither let them of little faith despaire, for GOD that dealt their measure, will maintaine and augment it, so they do their part and endeauour. Finally, when <hi>Paule</hi> requireth vs to be wise according to sobriety, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth in all Christians both blockishnesse or foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<pb n="1037" facs="tcp:20835:516"/>
and slothfulnesse; requiring in them both wisedome in the knowledge of vniuersall things both diuine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane; and prudence in the choice of particulars, about things profitable to the Church and our selues: likewise industry in applying their vnderstanding vnto the most be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of our selues and our brethren.</p>

Cor. 12. 12. and Ephes. 4, 4, 16. It is very fit and of great force to drawe men from curiosity and arrogancy, vnto humility and vnity; for as in a body naturall, albeit it be one, and the members ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, distinct the one from another, in place, order, vse, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, &amp; guifts; yet one member doth not inuade the roome, or vsurpe the duty of another, but each member keeping in his owne place and ranke, confers his owne proper gift and doth his owne office to the safety and good of the whole body in all peace and concord, without disdaning or enuying one another: So in the Church (which is Christs mysticall body) it is meete that each member en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour it selfe with quietnesse and modesty, to serue and benefite others, without intruding one into anothers cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. What efficacy to holde men in concorde this simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude hath, may be perceiued by the example of <hi>Meneni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Agrippa</hi> in <hi>Liuye,</hi> when the people in a faction and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, were tenting themselues from their Senators and

                     <p>What be the parts or things chiefely to bee considered in this similitude contained in verses 4, 5?</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>The first thing to be considered heere is, that the vnion or society of beleeuers is called a body: a matter v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall to giue the name of a body to a fellowship in all lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages: thus a Colledge is tearmed a body Scholasticall, a Citty, a body politicall: so the Congregation of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an professors, both 1. Cor. 10, 17. Ephe. 1, 22, 23. for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance and likenesse sake which is betweene a society and a bodye: for first in a naturall bodye, the body is but one, and the heade is but one; likewise the bodye of the Church which is but one, hath but one head, and that is Christ, Ephe. 1, 22. Col. 1, 18. Should therefore the Pope be a head to the Church? it would bee a monstrous body<note place="margin">The Pope no head of the Church.</note> hauing two heads at once, either principall or subordinate, yea foure heads at once, when besides Christ there were<note place="margin">Christ gaue some Apostles some Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, &amp;c.</note> three Anti-Popes actually, one at <hi>Auinion,</hi> another at <hi>Rauenna,</hi> a thirde at <hi>Rome:</hi> also <hi>Peter</hi> himselfe was but a member of the Church (as other beleeuers were) how the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can the Pope (suppose hee were <hi>Peters</hi> successour) bee an<note place="margin">Ephes 4, 11. but he gaue no head.</note> head? for thirty eight years together from Pope <hi>Euaristus</hi> vnto Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the sea of <hi>Rome</hi> had no Pope, therefore so long was a bodye without a head; yea were the Pope head, so often as the Pope dyeth, the Church also should dye. But what can a Pope doe, which an head ought to doe, eyther for externall direction (being an hereticke,) or for internall viuification and motion (being but a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) and therefore no head of the Church, which is the body and spouse of Christ; therfore the Pope no husband, no head of it, no not so much as a sound member, but hee is head rather of the Antichristian body, and Captaine of that apostacy from the faith, 2. Thes. 2.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="1039" facs="tcp:20835:517"/>The second thing to bee considered in this compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, is, that although the body of the Church bee one, and the head one, yet the members be many, all knit to Christ their head, and among themselues, by the inward glue of Faith and Christian charity, and by the outward band of the word and Sacraments; as our fleshlie mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers by sinnewes and arteries are ioyned to our head, &amp; one to another: and this is that communion which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Saints. Vnto which, nothing is more repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant then pride and strife. <hi>Let nothing</hi> (saith <hi>Paul) be done through contention or vaineglory, if there bee any communion of the Spirit, or comfort of loue,</hi> Phil. 2, 1. Where we learne, that contention and arrogancy cannot stand with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian communion.</p>
                     <p>The third thing to be obserued in this similitude, is, that the faithfull which are as many members, haue eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one a seuerall function, and a particular guift for or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and doing their function. As in our naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, there is no member but hath his owne office peculiar to it selfe, the eye to see, the eare to heare, the mouth to speake, the feete to walke, &amp;c. and to euery one belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his owne gift and faculty, as of seeing to the eye, &amp;c. So amongst the faithfull, some haue one function, some another, one was a Doctor, another a Pastor, one<note place="margin">Ephes. 4, 11.</note> an Elder, another was a Deacon; one a superiour &amp; ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 1.</note> another obeyeth as an inferiour; and euerie one of<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3, 8.</note> these haue singular and special gifts for the performance of their worke. Heere is moreouer to be obserued, that as in our naturall body, no one member incroacheth vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the gift or office of another, so in the church of God, one Christian shoulde not vsurpe the office of another, each is bound peaceably to doe his owne dutie without hinderance vnto, or disturbance of others, by proud cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity and busie medling.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, as the head, or eye, or eare, do not proudly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult ouer meaner members which haue lesse graces and offices in the body, so a man of great gifts may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
<pb n="1040" facs="tcp:20835:518"/>
one of a lesser; but euery Christian with humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse turne his gifts vnto the common good. As all the members in the body labour together ioyntly for the preseruation and good plight of the whole. The want of this hath brought such Schismes and factions as wee now see with much griefe, to bee too rife both in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth and Church of God.</p>

                     <p>He amplifieth that part of the comparison tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching diuers members, and different gifts and functions. As in a naturall body there be many members, and these haue sundry faculties and operations; so amongst the faithfull, they haue gifts and duties one diuers from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, (Seeing we haue gifts which are diuers) that is; We Christians (which be as many members) haue diuers gifts. Some the gift to teach, some the gifte to exhort, some to rule, some to distribute, some to shewe mercie, each haue their proper worke, and proper gift. Let eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in the vse of his gift be wise vnto sobrietie, (for this must be added to supply the sence) and not, let vs be conuetsant (as <hi>Beza</hi> woulde haue it) or, let vs attend and waite, as the <hi>Syrian</hi> Interpreters, and <hi>Gwalter</hi> doe thinke: but the words in the third verse [<hi>Let vs soberlie thinke,</hi> or <hi>Bew se to sobriety</hi>] must in common be applied to all these parts and branches following, which do all depend vpon that precept, and serue to expound it by the particulars.</p>

Secondly, the functions and giftes heere mentioned, bee ordinary, such as the Church of Christ hath neede of to the end of the world. As man consisteth

The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists wickedly dote, and dreame foolishly of a certaine vnwritten rule by Traditions, deliuered to the Church to try and proue by it, euen the writings and Bookes of the Apostles &amp; Euangelists which yet themselues wil be the Canon whereby to iudge of all that which is taught in the Church.</p>

First, when one doth hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily loue God, and that which is pleasing to him. A good rule: for then wee cannot choose but in our loue to our neighbour to be sincere, because sincerity and truth is a thing highly pleasing to God. The second rule, when we are ready to do towardes our neighbour, as wee our selues would bee dealt withall by others. This rule is commended in Math. 7, 12. for no man will dissemble or deale falsely with himselfe. The third rule is, not to loue in word and tongue onely, but in truth and indeede, 1. Iohn 3, 18. not as they are spoken of, in Iames 2, 15, 16. but as God loued mankinde, to whom he promised his Sonne by word, and afterwarde sent him at the sulnesse of time, Gal. 4, 4. or as Christ, who shewed his loue not onely by kinde speeches, but by giuing his life, 1 Iohn 3, 16. so our loue must bee expressed in actions, and then it is sound and vndissembled. Lip loue, is lying loue.</p>

                     <p>It serues for iust and due reproofe of all such as make shew of loue and mean it not: such as giue sugred for words to hide the gaule of the heart, and the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the hand, speaking faire when they meane foule, as <hi>Caine</hi> did speake to <hi>Abell, Ioab</hi> to <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Amaza,</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> to Christ. These had honie in their lippes, and swords in their hearts. Secondly, such as shew loue out of seruile base feare and dread, as Malefactors and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders do to seuere Magistrates, bad seruants to their vncourteous Maisters, and the poore to the mighty who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they could wish in their graues, yet by speeches and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures, pretend much reuerence and loue. Thirdly, such as loue others for profit. which they hope to suck out of them; so long they make much of them, giue kind words as <hi>Felix</hi> did, Acts 4. At a word, all such are heere condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="1046" facs="tcp:20835:521"/>
as do not loue their neighbors out of a pure heart, the seate of loue, vnfaigned Faith the cause of loue, a good conscience the companion of loue, 1 Tim. 1, 5. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, beside reprehension, heere is exhortation to all to striue for vnfaigned loue in all their dealinges with men by word or deed, to declare the truth of their loue, secming to be in kindnesse what indeed they be, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they seeme: for God hateth hypocrisie, it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious in his sight, and vnto all good men. Also dissimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, as it is contrary vnto the nature of God: so it is hurtfull to our neighbor: it makes vs like a broken bow, whereof the shiuers are ready to run into his hand which leanes vpon it, or a broken staffe which fayleth him that trusteth thereunto, or vnto a loose tooth; for so is a false friend.</p>

Heereof we haue <hi>Dauid</hi> an example. Psal. 139, 22. but more especially it may be restrained vnto loue, whereof we spake in the former Aphorisme: and then by good and euill, vnderstand not only that which is honest and dishonest, but that also which is profitable and hurtfull, &amp; by abhorring and cleauing is meant ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame hatred, and singular desire.</p>

in him, though he bee neuer so deare a friend: nor from liking &amp; eagerly embracing that good and vertue which is in him, be he neuer such an enemy vnto vs. As the loue of mens persons must not make vs loue their faults, or flatter them, or winke at them, or defend them: so the hatred of mens vices must nor drawe vs from the desire and earnest delight in that which is good in anie man. Furthermore, it is the property of true loue to be excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding loath to iniure or hurt ouer neighbour, or suffer him to bee hurt in any thing which is precious vnto him; as his name, person, goodes, wife, saluation, &amp;c. but rather verie earnestly to studie how to pleasure and helpe him in all and euerie one of these: to thinke, and speake, and do him good, being so bent vnto the profit of our Neighbour, as to our owne welfare, according to the saying of our Sauiour Christ, <hi>Loue thy neighbour as thy selfe.</hi>

The grounds or begetter of this opinion bee these 4. First, authority, publike in Magistrates or Ministers, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate in parents or Maisters.

Thirdly, guifts outward of the body, or inward of the minde, eyther naturall, ciuill, morall; or spirituall, and theologicall, as faith, hope, loue, repentance, &amp;c. Fourthly, merites, when any deserue well, of Schooles, or Church, or Common-wealth, by publike benefits, as that Centurion did, Luke 8, 4.

Whereof we haue example in <hi>Moses,</hi> who out of zeale brake the two Tables: in <hi>Elias</hi> doing the seruice of God with much power and feruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as appeareth in destroying the Idolles, and killing <hi>Eaals</hi> Priests.

<pb n="1051" facs="tcp:20835:523"/>
Acts</hi> 14, 14, 15. and in Christ, Iohn 2, 14, 15, 16. and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally in all the Prophets and apostles. They walke not according to this rule, who are cold in their profession. Also those who be neither hot nor cold, but luke warme in their Religion, beeing indifferent, not caring which end goeth foremost. Nor they who be temporizers and neuters in the confession of their faith: also by this rule Gods children are exhorted to a godly feruency &amp; zeale both in profession and practise of religion. For zeale is a fruite of the Spirit, and of godly sorrow, 2 Cor. 7, 11. and heere by wee become like Christ and the apostles, Lastly, it is good to be zealously affected still in a good thing (saith <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 4, 18.) Note here, that these words import a continuall acte. Christians are to bee diligent and earnest, not by pangs or fits, but all their life long, and in one thing as well as in another, and according to the quality of the matter, that will shew our zeale to be wise and good, and proceeding from God. Such as are zealous at the first, and afterwards become colde, or be lesse zealous in the chiefest businesse; or be forwarde in some matter of profit or pleasure to themselues, &amp; not so in the thinges of God, giue suspition that their zeale is fleshly and carnall.</p>

                     <p>Some reade it thus, seruing the time, and then the meaning is either to watch opportunities or occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of dooing our duties, and to obserue what is fitting for time and season, according to that in Rom. 13, 11. or to consider what belongs to the time, after the example of <hi>Paul,</hi> at one time circumcising <hi>Timothy,</hi> when he would not circumcise <hi>Titus</hi> at another, Gal. 2, 3, 4. And heerein there is great wisedome to consider what is meet and fit to bee done, according to time and place (yet without departing from truth and honesty) for all good thinges are not to be done at all times. Howbeit the other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (seruing the Lord) is much better, as warranted by

diaers Greeke Coppies, and directing vs to the right &amp; true end of all our actions, namely the seruice and glory of God, whereunto they must aime as at their vtmost marke, Cor. 10, 31. and this doth distinguish Christian<note place="margin">So M Beza affirmeth</note> duties from the workes of ciuill men, who neuer respect the worship or honour of God, but their owne pleasure and praise in all things, whatsoeuer they pretend to the contrary. Also this precept may further teach vs whome wee are to serue, namely, not the worlde nor men, but God, because he is our Lord, Psal. 2, 11. Gal. 1, 10. 1 Cor. 7, 23. and 1 Cor. 6, 20.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, it may teach great men modestie, that they swell not by opinion of their owne power and might, remembering that they are vnder God, as a seruant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his Lord, and therefore not to abuse their inferiors, Col. 4, 1. for they serue one common and most iust Lord, who is no respecter of persons.</p>

                     <p>Vnto these three, Hope, Patience, and Prayer,<note place="margin">Hope patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce Prayer.</note> which are so many remedies against afflictions of al sorts. The first of these graces is set foorth and declared by an effect of reioycing. The second, by his Obiect, which is ttibulation. The third by the adioynt, which is perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. When any affliction happens, priuate or publicke, inward or outward, for Christ or sinne, Gods Children thorough hope of deliuerance from them, faint not in their hearts, but reioyce and are glad, because they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely looke for saluation in the end; for their hope makes them not asnamed, Rom. 5. 5. and by hope they are saued, Rom. 8, 24. But if their afflictions continue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and waxe more greeuous, then to hope must be ioyned patience, which enableth to endure with sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission vnto, and wayting vpon the pleasure of God, as we are admonished in many places, Math. 24, 13. Rom. 5, 4. Heb. 10, 36. 2 Pet. 2, 9. To hope and patience must be ioyned prayer, which is a notable armour and Weapon against troubles, because it gets wisedome how to carry
<pb n="1053" facs="tcp:20835:524"/>
our selues in afflictions; and diuine helpe how to come out of it, that we may ouercom, Iam. 1, 5. Ps. 50, 15. Our prayers may the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be said to be continual, eyther when we cal vpon God by offered occasions, &amp; necessities bodily<note place="margin">How our praiers be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall.</note> or spirituall; or when by no meanes wee intermit the set hours or times of prayer; or else when we are instant in praier, asking earnestly, Ia. 5. or tho we be not heard pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently, when we continue to ask without ceasing, Lu. 18. or els we may vnderstand this not of mouing of the lips, but the desires of the heart, which when they are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall, our prayers bee continuall, for a continuall desire, is a continuall prayer; <hi>God will heare the desires of them that feare him,</hi> Psal. 145. It was an heresie condemned in <hi>Eutiches</hi> and the <hi>Masstlians,</hi> that thought Christians ought all their life long to doe nothing else but pray: a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>busing this and the like Texts to this end. Whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Prayer, the workes of our generall and particular vocation are to bee followed, yea in Gods seruice there is preaching, &amp; Sacraments must haue time allowed. It is a greeuous sinne in many Christians at this day, which contenting themselues with publicke prayer (which is a good thing) neglect set Prayers in their families, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slow the iust occasions to turne vnto God by prayer, or in their prayers do behaue themselues coldly or careles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: such as these, they both fall into many euils, and are left in their euils without comfort, because they seek not vnto God feruently for his ayde and protection. Finally, remember vnto all these precepts, and to the rest follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing, to knit these first words of this Chapter [<hi>I beseech you</hi>] at a generall and most forcible motiue, to stir vs vp to practise them, as we would not cast from vs, and make our selues vnworthy of the mercies of God, whereunto not all the world is to be compared, no not to the least of his speciall and sauing mercies in Christ.</p>

                     <p>Liberality or mercy to the poore, that we be ready to giue them almes acording to their need. The word translated [necessities,] signifies [vses] to teach vs, that as wee may not minister to the delicates of the poore, so we may not stay til extreame necessity vrgeth them vnto this duty of mercy in giuing. There be manie exhortations in the Scripture, vppon sundry and great Reasons, as Heb. 13. 16. where it is called a Sacrifice, and God is saide to be well pleased with it. In Phil. 4, 18. it is called an Odour of sweete smell, a Sacrifice acceptable to God. And Actes 20, 35. it is saide, that it is a more blessed thing to giue then to receiue: and Luke 16, 9. we are charged to make friendes of vnrighteous Mammon, by giuing to the poore, that they may receiue vs into c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting habitation: and 1 Tim. 6, 18, 19. of distributing to the poore <hi>Paul</hi> saith, it is the laying of a good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation against the time to come.</p>
                     <p>Againe, Christians bee stewardes, and it is required, that stewards be faithfull, to dispose their goods to the minde of their Maister, and his mind is, that such as haue much, should giue to such as haue little; and that the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of some, should supply the wants of others. 2. Cor. 8, 13, 14. Further, by being mercifull to the poore, we are like our heauenly Father, which is mercifull and giues liberally, Math. 5, 45. also we expresse loue &amp; kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to Christ, by doing good to his members, Mat. 25, 35. 36, 37. We witnesse to our selues and others the truth of our faith, which works by loue, Gal. 5, 6. and comforts the heart of our Brethren, Phile. 7. and brings glorie to God and our profession. Besides al these forenamed rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, ther be three reasons more in our text, to perswade vnto this duty, as the loue of Saints, because poore chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are [Saints] purged by the blood, and sanctifyed by the Spirit of Christ.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="1055" facs="tcp:20835:525"/>Secondly, the compassion of their necessities and wants which we are bound to pitty. Thirdly, liberality in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating. By which word of communicating, we are put in mind, in that the Apostle saith rather communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting then giuing; that the poore haue an interest in the goods of the rich, as touching the vse by vertue of Gods commandement: and that the rich ought to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with them in affections and simpathy, by releeuing them, as if they felt their wants, and suffered with them, Heb. 13, 3. And lastly, that betweene rich and poore, there is a kinde of spirituall trafficke and merchandize, the rich communicating temporall things in making the poore partakers of their substaunce, and the poore spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, in making the rich partakers of their prayers. The examples of such men as haue perfourmed this duty, is first <hi>Dorcas,</hi> Acts 9, 39. making coats to giue to the pore: the brethren of <hi>Antioch</hi> sending relief to the pore Saints at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> whom also the Church of <hi>Macedonia</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue euen beyond their power, 2 Cor. 9, 2, 3. Now as for the maner how beneficence is to be performed 2 Cor. 8, &amp; 9. chap. not grudgingly, or of necessity, or sparingly, not of compulsion, but out of a Christian compassion, of a ready mind with cheerefulnes, for the loue and sake of Christ, and as to him; for God loues a chearful giuer. For the quantity, it must be much where much is, 2 Cor. 9, 8, 11. 1 Tim. 6, 18. no certaine stint or rate, but according to thy ability, and thy neighbors necessity.</p>

<pb n="1056" facs="tcp:20835:526"/>
entreaty, or by authority, as seises. Lastly, in giuing, chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are to beware both of opinion of merite, which poysoneth Popish liberality, and of vaineglorie, which spoiles the bounty of many Protestants giuing, to bee seene and talked of.</p>

Note in our Text, that he saith not imbrace, but be giuen: which signifies to pursue and follow it with eagernesse and earnestnesse, as if it were not enough to inuite strangers, and to receiue them, but that we ought also to entreat and vrge them to come to vs; after the example of <hi>Lydia,</hi> Acts 16, 15. and of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Gen. 18. and of <hi>Lot,</hi> Gen. 19. which while they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued strangers, vnawares entertained Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13, 2.

                     <p>As before <hi>Paul</hi> taught what our behauiour should be towards friends, and the houshold of Faith, so<note place="margin">Blesse, what it is.</note> he now teacheth duty towards them which are without, which are enemies, whom he willeth vs to [blesse,] that is, both to wish well vnto them, and to speake well of them (as farre as we may with matter of trueth;) both to pray for, and to praise them according to their worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, yea and to do good vnto them also, if they neede it. In that <hi>Paul</hi> repeateth the word [<hi>Blesse</hi>] twice, &amp; then sets it foorth by the contrary word [<hi>Curse</hi>] hee puts vs in minde both how hard a worke this is, being a worke of the Spirit, and not of the flesh, as being contrarie to our corrupt nature. Also, that we should not do it by fittes,
<pb n="1057" facs="tcp:20835:526"/>
but be constant in blessing. <hi>Paul</hi> borroweth this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept from the words of Christ, Math. 5, 24. Wee haue Christ himselfe a patterne of it, Esay 53, 12. and <hi>Steuen, Acts</hi> 7, 6. and 1 Pet 2, 22. all Christians are called to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the example of Christes patience towards their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                     <p>The practise of this duty, is the verie touchstone &amp; triall of all Christian charity. For to speake well, and do well vnto such as loue vs, is no singular matter: it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to Gods children with Publicans and sinners; but to loue &amp; blesse an enemy, is the peculiar worke of a godly<note place="margin">Where were patience, or experience, or hope without these persecutions of wicked men? saith <hi>Chrystostome.</hi>
                        </note> person: see Mat. 5, 43, 46. Luke 6, 27, 35. This forbidding to curse, must be meant of priuate enemies. Againe, from this precept wee may learne, that Gods children must make account, that there will neuer want wicked men to persecute them both with their tongues by raylings, slanderings, and calumnies; and with their swordes or hand, by losse of goods, imprisonment, death, &amp;c. and that for trueth and righteousnesse sake. Heere of Christ forewarned his Disciples, Math. 5, 10. The best remedie we haue in such cases, to breake the malice and crueltie of wicked men, is by patience and wel-doings, 1 Pet. 4, 19.</p>

                     <p>It serues to reproue such enuious persons which fret and repine at the good and happy estate of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, as <hi>Caine</hi> enuied <hi>Abell, Saul Dauid,</hi> and the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies Christ; and the malicious also, who in stead of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning together for the losses of others, are well pleased and make themselues merry and sportfull with the miseries of their neighbours; this is a wickednesse against which <hi>Iob</hi> doth protest, Chap. 31, verse 29. and for the which God threatneth the <hi>Edomites</hi> in <hi>Obadiah,</hi> verse 12, 13. It is the part of all Christians to be vnlike vnto both these, and by simpathy and fellow-feeling of other mens both ioyes and sorrowes, to expresse our owne loue to our brethren, and to shew that wee are voide of enuy, and to enlarge their loue againe towards vs, when they shall see vs ready to communicate with them, both in their gladnesse and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinesse: and finally somewhat to ease and lessen the grieses and afflictions of our neighbours, by helping the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to beare the borthen in a common affection.

Secondly, the knitting of the heart and affections in the actions and counsels of life. Thus the Apostle Phil. 2. 2. hauing generally exhorted to concorde by the same phrase vsed heere in the text, (<hi>hee yee like minded</hi>) doth presently subdiuide it into coniunction of loue and affections, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement in minde or iudgement.

But because there will still bee imperfections in the best men this way, as appeareth by Acts 15, 39, therefore wee must striue the more to obey this precept, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy nesynity, forbearing one another, and forgiuing one another, as Col. 3, 13. and doing according to that which is written Phil. 3, 15, 16.

                     <p>In the next three precepts two hinderances of mutuall concorde are remoued, and one furtherance ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto is commended. The first hinderance is pride, that is to say, when in disdaine of others, whom we doe not take to be so good as our selues, wee haue too lofty a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite of our owne guifts and sufficiency; and out of a haughtinesse of minde, do aspire to higher place and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, then wee are made or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> for: this is to bee high minded, euen to beare a Iosty heart, and to aspire in our mindes to high things which bee aboue our capacity and calling.</p>

                        <pb n="1060" facs="tcp:20835:528"/>Hence is pride in Latine, called <hi>Superbia,</hi> euen as one would say <hi>Superire alies,</hi> and in Greek <hi>hypsilophronia,</hi> that is, Iosty mindednesse, when men looke on high matters out of a great conceite of their owne strength, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising of others. Of this disease was <hi>Absolon</hi> sick, when he ambitiously aspired to his Fathers kingdome: and the Pharisie in the Gospell, Luke 18. when out of too great opinion of his owne merits, he disdained the poor Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican: yea, the two Apostles of our Sauiour, <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> were somewhat infected with this disease, when they stroue to bee greater then their fellow Apostles. There were sundry such high-minded persons, both in the Church of <hi>

                     <p>Hence it is, that the Apostle so much beateth downe pride, both heere and in the third verse of this Chapter, and in the eleaueuth Chapter, verses 18, 20. For he saw the beleeuing Romanes, to bee lifted vp against the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected Iewes, whence much dissention followed; and therefore desires them not to be highminded: but were <hi>Paule</hi> aliue now, to see the pride of Rome in Popes and Prelates, both spiritual and bodily pride, oh how would he thunder against it?</p>

No man seeth all: and as our English Proueibe is,
<pb n="1061" facs="tcp:20835:528"/>
                        <hi>Two eyes see better then one.</hi> Experience also teacheth vs, that the simple may giue counsell to the wisest, as <hi>Iethro</hi> did to <hi>Moses,</hi> Deut. 18. <hi>Abigail</hi> did to <hi>Dauid,</hi> 1 Sam. 25, 25. and thus hath God ordained it for the best preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of loue and concord, as also to nourish humility and to kill pride.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, such as bee wise in themselues, turne their wisedome altogether to their owne profit, and not vnto the good of others, contrary to that of the Apostle, <hi>Cba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity seeketh not her owne things,</hi> 1 Cor. 13, 5. Thirdly, such regard not the will and pleasure of GOD, which is true wisedome indeede, contenting themselues with worldlie wisedome, which is foolishnesse with God, 1 Cor. 3, 19. Such men as they, do not consult with God in his worde, so they do not ascribe the praise of their wisedom to God, the author of their wisedome, but to their owne wit and industry.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, this arrogancy and outreaching opinion of our owne wisedome, is by long experience proued to bee the mother of error of all sorts, whether in doctrine, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, or common conuersation: for on the one side, the cause why men giue ouer themselues to grosse sinnes in their liues and actions, is this, that in arrogancie of spirite, they hold scorne to be taught and admonished of others: they know as much as any man can tell them, and let men meddle with themselues.

                     <p>Humility, when we condescend to men of lowe estate, or submit our selues to the lowly or humble.

But the best way is, vnder this worde, to comprehend both things and persons, that for charity and concorde sake, we should embrace humble persons, &amp; base things, out of a lowly minde, in imitation of our Saulour, who conuersed with Publicans and sinners, Luke 15.

It is like that precept of Christ, Mat. 5, 39. It is a corruption of our nature, that we are prone to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne wrong for wrong, one ill turne for another, and men thinke they haue a goodly pretence for it, because others began with them, and prouoked them: but the truth is, that whereas it is no small sinne, to infer and do hurt to another, in his person, name, or goods, by word or deede, secretly or openly; for such doe offend first a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God, forbidding wrong doing Secondly, against charity, which doth no euil to her neighbor, 1 Cor. 13, 5.
<pb n="1063" facs="tcp:20835:529"/>
Thirdly, against Iustice, which measures right to euerie man, and condemnes all iniuries: yet to referre and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite one euill with another, is a farre greater sinne, not onely because they do adde sinne to sinne, but for that a man may do a hurt suddenly and vnaduisedly, not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing that he doth euill, but offending through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or ouersight; whereas they that recompence euill for euill, doe it purposely, maliciously, and wittingly, knowing that they do euil, and yet wil do it: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariwise they that patiently and meekely suffer iniuries, as they keepe themselues pure from sinne, so they declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be led by the Spirit of God (which is the Spirit of meekenesse) and to beare the Image of Christ, who when he was reuiled, reuiled not againe; and when hee suffered, threatned not 1 Pet. 2, 23. Heere it must be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued, that this precept of retaliation reacheth not to the Magistrate, whose office it is to render euil for euill, tooth for tooth, eye for eye, bloud for bloud: see Rom: 13. to render euill to an euill doer, is a worke of iustice, and therefore good.

                     <p>Moreouer if it be euill to recompence euill for euill, it is far worse to recompence euill for good. This is not onely an humane error, but a diabolicall naughtinesse &amp; the very height of all vnthankfulnesse, to deale vnkindly with such as haue vsed vs kindely: the iust GOD hath threatned that euill shall neuer depart from the house of such as so do: let the Iews be an instance for proof here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for the wrath and vengeance of God lies heauy vpon that nation vntill this day; because vnto the Prophets, vnto Christ, vnto the Apostles, which did good to them by instructing them, &amp; calling them vnto the kingdome of God, they wretchedly recompenced much euill, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting some, reuiling some, and killing others. Lastly, note that euil must be requited to no man; neither to a frend

and a Christian, for he is our brother; nor yet to an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my or Infidell, for he is a man as we are, made after Gods owne image.</p>

                     <p>Iust and holy things whereby the praise of God is aduanced, and the saluation of our neighbour furthered. Secondly, such things as cannot bee done without offence though they be lawfull, 1. Corinth. 10. 23. When he saith these things must be (proued) hee thereby sheweth very manifestly, that these things are not to bee done carelesly and at all aduenture, but with great diligence and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or forecast: so the word in the originall importeth, as if in our mindes and thoughts wee should study before hand, and prouide that nothing be done but what may be approued of God &amp; al good men: &amp; it is to be noted that these tearmes (before all men) may eyther be opposed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, as if it were saide: Be very carefull that the things ye doe be honest and good, both in the sight of God and men. This opposition is expressed in 2. Cor. 8, 2. or else al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the antithesis is betweene man and man; as who should say, Both to this man and that man, to the <hi>Iew</hi> and to the <hi>Grecian,</hi> to one as well as another, friend or stranger, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry your selues honestly, whether they bee pleased or not pleased, yet let all that is done before them bee honest. Heereby bee reprooued such who procure things honest, onely before men, neglecting God, as hypocrites whoe looke alone to their reputation among men, Mat. 6, 1. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they which doe honest things before God, but are rechlesse in giuing satisfaction to men, or if they iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="1065" facs="tcp:20835:530"/>
their doings to some men, it is with contempt of others. Lastly, they which exercise honesty neyther before God nor men, but are without reucrence of God, or care of men, like the Iudge in Luke 18, 3. Many such leud and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious euill liueis there be, which haue shaken out of their hearts the feare of God, and the shame of the worlde, the loue of heauen, and the dread of hell; not caring what be thought or spoken of them in earth, or what euill happen to them from heauen; forlorne persons addicted to euill courses.</p>

                     <p>Vnto these two: the first is peaceablenesse, or loue and care of a peaceable life. The second is meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in forbearing reuenge, vpon this reason that Gods office is to take vengeance: which is confirmed by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Scripture, verse 19 20, 21. and set forth by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary of doing good for euill, in stead of taking reuenge.

                     <p>In the 16. verse, inward concord amongst Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian brethren was commended (as a thing simply necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,) now the study of retaining peace with strangers from the faith, and infidels or heretickes (as well as Christians) is required, as this clause sheweth (with all men.) First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause<note place="margin">Reasons of a peaceable life</note> God commanded it to be so. Secondly, he deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="1066" facs="tcp:20835:531"/>
in peace, thence he is called the God of peace, Rom. 16. Thirdly, he hath pronounced them blessed, that keep and make peace, Mat. 5. Fourthly, many and sweete are the benefits of peace, but bitter and sundry are the fruites of contention, vexation of minde, waste of substance, &amp;c. We are to follow this peace vpon two conditions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this precept differeth from the next before it, for wee must absolutely at all times, before all men prouide for things honest; but peace cannot be had but with certaine men, therefore he addeth conditions to limit and restraine this exhortation.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>These conditions are not all one (as some thinke) but diuers: the former (if it bee possible) she weth that in some cases and with some men peace cannot be had, name ly when question is of religion, that God is to be offended by partaking with Idolators or heretickes, or when by our silence the truth is to bee betrayed, and our neighbours saluation hindered. In these cases with good conscience peace cannot possibly be retained; we cannot haue socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with men in euill things and wickednesse, for our duty is to resist and oppugne such things according to our vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, guifts and meanes, though peace bee broken: a godly dissention is better then a wicked peace; peace must be followed with holinesse, Heb. 12, 14. We ought so to haue peace with men, as we doe not make war with God. Hence Apostles and Apostlo like men haue chosen to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend by writing and preaching against errors &amp; superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (see <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Galathians, Augustine</hi> against the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichees</hi> and <hi>Donatists,</hi>) rather then by holding their peace, to forsake Gods truth and the edification of the Church. The other condition is (so much as lies in vs) which is put in, in respect of such contentious quarrelsome persons, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="1067" facs="tcp:20835:531"/>
when he spake to them of peace, Psal. 120. Towards these we shall doe our duty when wee are in our selues peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly disposed, neyther giuing them, nor hastily taking from them occasion of dissention, but by all meanes prouoking them to quietnesse, that there bee no fault in vs. Finally, bearing good will to their persons when we are driuen to hate and rebuke their vices, praying earnestly for their conuersion: this is all that lyeth in vs to doe.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>To perswade vnto meekenesse and moderation of anger toward such as offer wrong vnto vs; albeit the Apostle had forbad vs before, not to recompence euill for euill, yet knowing the pronnesse of our corrupt nature to take reuenge for iniuries done, vnder pretext that we may be dastards and cowards: and to shew how hard and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a thing it is, meekely to suffer: therefore in other words he repeateth againe his exhortation, saying [<hi>auenge not your selues</hi>] which is set forth heere by the contrary du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (giue place vnto wrath:) this is by some and may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the wrath of our enemy, whereunto if men giue way, they doe oftentimes purchase peace, their wrath being mollified by patience. For as thunderings makes a great noyse, and breakes downe strong things when they hit vpon things that resist them, as Okes, &amp;c. so do guns also ouerthrow wals and towers: but meeting with things soft and yeelding, they doe very easily penetrate and pierce through; they loose their strength and doe no harme. Likewise, the wrath of men is much asswaged, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times quenched by yeelding, and silence, or soft answeres, but it is made more hot by resisting. This sentence also may bee vnderstoode of our owne anger, which euery one is to bridle and to moderate. But <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth this especially of diuine anger and reuenge, which we must suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to shew it selfe foorth against our aduersaries, and not preuent it by our impatiency and fury. This to be the most naturall sence appeares by that which followes; for it is written (<hi>Vengeance is mine,</hi>) a text fetched out of Deut. 32. 35. where God threatens that in his due time he will take vengeance vpon wicked liuers.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <pb n="1068" facs="tcp:20835:532"/>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>But how may we be assured that God will be auenged<note place="margin">Doubt.</note> vpon them which hurt vs, and vpon what reasons are wee to leaue vengeance to him alone?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, because it is his office [<hi>Mine is vengeance,</hi>]<note place="margin">Solution.</note> now he will neglect nothing that pertaineth to him. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Gods children are deare vnto him, euen as the apple of his eye, so precious in his fight, that he will not forget their iniuries. Thirdly, there is no hurt done vnto any, but first there is iniury done to God by transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his Law. In all wrongs to our neighbor, God is first wronged, which he must punish. Fourthly, GOD is the Iudge of the world, and it belongeth to him to do euery man right. Fiftly, he can be auenged without perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or passion, and so cannot we. Moreouer, God will do it more sharply, and with more seuerity then we can do. Lastly, if we do it our selues, we do not onely spoile God of his right aud authority, (as if a subiect shoulde wrestthe sword out of his hand, and depriue our selues of his protection and defence;) but whereas in taking wrong we were meere sufferers of euill, in the auenging of wrong, we become the doers of euill, and sinners; &amp; so liable to Gods auenging hand as well as our enimies. And lastly, we shew our selues vnlike to Christ, and like to Satan; therefore the onely way is to leaue &amp; commit our enemies onely vnto GOD: not that we are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire his vengeance vpon our neighbors, or to take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in it: but hauing prayed heartily for their conuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on if they continue malicious, and hee punisheth them, we are to delight more in Gods Iustice, then in theyr paine.</p>
                     <p>Finally, this precept bindes priuate mens hands, and not Magistrates, whose duty it is to take vengeance. Ro.<note place="margin">Magistrates be lawfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uengers.</note> 13, 2. not for himselfe, as this Text faith, but on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe of God, whose Minister he is, and of his neighbour who is offended. Also, it is no breach of this precept in our extreamities, to flye to Magistrates for succour, so it be not with a reuenging minde to make him the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="1069" facs="tcp:20835:532"/>
of our hatred, but with an honest purpose to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue our selues and others whom wee haue charge of<note place="margin">How we may vse Lawe and authority.</note> from dangers.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, to haue the wrong dooer brideled and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by moderate corruption. Thirdly, to haue scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall remoued from among Gods people. Fourthlie, to haue others feared from euill doing by example of their punishment. For these ends, it is as lawfull for vs to vse the Magistrate, as to vse the Sunne, or ayre, or any other creature or ordinance of God. <hi>Paul</hi> appealed to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and called for helpe against those which had vowed his death, Acts 23, 23, 24.</p>

                        <hi>Samaritan</hi>) if he bee in want, and that by our kindnesse we do not maintaine him in his sinne, or against God &amp; his King and countrey. This is the greatest triall of our Christian loue, Math. 5, 44. Luke 6, 35. By coales of fire, is meant diuine plagues and punishment which hang o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the heads of such malicious men as will not bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by our beneficence and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dealing with them, (thus M. <hi>Beza,</hi> and most rightly.) And heere is shewed not the purpose of the doer, but the euent: that this is the best sence, appeares by comparing this place with Pro. 25, 22. whence it is taken, and by other places wher the same phrase is vsed in the Psal. 18, 13. and 120, 4. to note the kindling of Gods wrath and iudgements. [<hi>To be ouercome by euill</hi>] is to be impatient for wrong done to vs, and to study reuenge. To ouercome euill with goodnes, signifies to shew mercy and kindnesse where we receiue euill. This is a more noble victory to conquer our selues, then if we ouercame a Citty. <hi>Fortior est qui se quam qui fortissima vincit. Nobile vincendi genus est se vincere posse.</hi>
                     </p>

thought to take awaie all power from man to auenge our wronges, he now teacheth that Magistrates are set vp of God to be his ministers to take vengeance of euil dooers.</p>
                     <p>Secondlie hauing saide that we must doe good to such as hurt vs, he now very fitlie inferreth, that we ought much more to reuerence and obey Gouerners which are helpfull to mankinde. Now the reasons which mooued <hi>Paul</hi> to make a set treatise touching the honour due vnto Rulers are these: First, to stoppe the mouthes of such as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the Gospell of Christ, to be an enemy to authority against Kings and Princes, for thus the Christians were accused in the Apostles time. Secondly, in respect of the Iewes who being borne of <hi>Abraham,</hi> free borne and Gods peculiar people, did seeke to shake off the yoke of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, who were now become their Lords.

Vpon these considerations it seemeth the Apostle doth now very seasonably vrge ciuill obedience: and as all the precepts in the former Chapter from the ninth verse to the end, are branches of the sixt Commandeinent (Thou shalt not murder,) so this that hee speaketh now of subiection to Rulers, belongeth to the fift commandement, whereof it is a part; for what else bee Magistrates but Parents of their Country, raised vp of God with a fatherly affection to defend the lawes and publike peace, and to procure the common good, and to bee honoured of the people vnder them with child-like reuerence and obedience?</p>

                     <p>The proposition is in the first words (<hi>Let euery soule bee subiect to the higher powers</hi>) the meaning heereof is, Let euery man and woman bee in subiection to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate. In the worde [<hi>soule</hi>] there is a Synechdoche, as the flesh or body (which is put apart) is sometimes put for the whole man, as in those sayings of <hi>Esay,</hi> all flesh is grasse, and againe, all flesh shall see the saluation of God: so the soule doth often signifie the whole man, as in Genesis 46. <hi>Iacob</hi> went downe into Egypt with 70. soules, and Acts 27, 37. and so in this place the whole man is denominated from the soule which is the principall part: and in the Psal. (Soule) is sometimes put for the man himselfe, but yet the Apostle vseth rather the word [soule] then man, for these reasons, as namely first of all to teach vs that the subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he requireth, must be voluntary, not vpon compulsion but willingly. Secondly, to shewe that inferiors not in substance onely and body, but must bee subiect also euen in their very soules, in such things as they may doe with a good conscience, otherwise they ought to obey God ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then men. Thirdly, to declare that all mortall men without exception of any, (euen as many as haue soules) must yeeld their subiection to Rulers.</p>

                     <p>It is so, for the meaning thereof is thus much, that all men of what condition, sexe, or age soeuer (none exempted) must be subiect. Therefore foolish aud very false is that collection of <hi>Origen,</hi> that such as bee vtterly spirituall and doe not follow the affections of the flesh, are not to liue vnder Princes, because <hi>Paul</hi> wrote thus [<hi>Let euery soule</hi>] not let euery spirite, this is more subtle then sound, for none were more spiritual then Christ &amp; his Apostles, and yet none were more subiect then they; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is better to say with <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> that this vniuersall particle [all] doth comprehend all without exception of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and that this precept is giuen not to secular men one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but also to Priests and Monkes, as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith,
<pb n="1073" facs="tcp:20835:534"/>
Whether hee bee an Apostle or Prophet, or Euangelist, or whatsoeuer hee be, let him bee subiect, for this subiection (saith he) doth not ouerthrow religion. Heereunto accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>Bernard,</hi> in an epistle of his to the Clergy of <hi>Rome, Epist.</hi> 42. <hi>Si omnis anima subyci debeat, quis eos excipiet ab hac vniuersalitate? quisquis conatur clericos excipere, tentat decipere:</hi> yea Christ himself did not plead priuiledge against this precept, neyther did grant exemption vnto any.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It reproues diuers sorts of persons: First the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptist who will not admit Christians eyther to beare Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistracy, or to bee subiect vnto authority; as if it were fit for Insidels but not for the faithfull to be subiect to pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; vnder this pretence, that being Christs sreemen they may not liue in seruitude, or be bound vnto any: whereas <hi>Paul</hi> directeth this precept to the beleeuing Romanes, who were Christians by profession, whose spirituall freedome from sinne, Sathan, and damnation is not repugnant vnto corporall subiection, due to ciuill Magistrates. There is nothing in the Gospell against this but rather much for it, that a man may be both a Christian and a subiect, as well as a wife, a maister, a seruant and a childe. The second kinde heere reproued, are certaine irregular and exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant persons amongst our selues, who though they bee in iudgement conuicted, and cannot but confesse that this precept is giuen to all Christians, and touching all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, yet they make themselues a disperisation, and take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to doe what they list, without all due regard to that which is by superiors commanded. Heerein ioyning with Anabaptists and Libertines, that as touching their prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise they striue to shake off from their neckes the yoake (though not of supreame) yet of subordinate Gouernors, as if they were too good to obey some powers.</p>
                     <p>The third kinde is the Pope and his Cleargy, who do not onely pleade for an exemption, but also do practise it with such manifest and grosse wickednesse, as that the
<pb n="1074" facs="tcp:20835:535"/>
Pope doth not onely withdraw subiection from Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, but hath lifted vp his throne, aboue the Throne of Emperors and Kings, whom hee taketh vpon him to set vp and pull downe at his pleasure, to dispose their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and despise, nay destroy their persons (vpon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of heresie) and is not only not subiect to them, but causeth them to bow downe their neckes vnder his feete, and most filthily to worship him by kissing them, vnder this pretext, that the soule is better then the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and therefore spirituall Gouernors, which teach the soule, are to be preferred before temporal, whose charge it is to looke to the body, and worldly things. It was the argument of Pope <hi>Baniface</hi> the eight, whereas in trueth, it is not the fashion of Popes to preach the gospel, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they little trouble themselues; but to Lord it, and liue in pompe and pleasure. And say, they did teach the word of God, yet as Kings (how great soeuer their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity be) must subiect their vnderstandings and willes to be gouerned by the word which the ministers propound (for Gods word must rule the highest Rulers,) so Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, though their function be very high and excellent, yet cannot free themselues from subiection vnto ciuill Magistrates, because it is heere imperatiuely comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. <hi>Let euery soule be subiect:</hi> As the High-Priests were subiects, <hi>Aaron</hi> to <hi>Moses, Abiathar</hi> and <hi>Zadock</hi> to <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and Romisn byshoppes to the first Christian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>

This em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phasis the learned obserue in this word.

<pb n="1075" facs="tcp:20835:535"/>

And as in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane bodies, the other members, as handes, armes, and legges, &amp;c. do by nature acknowledge the head as chief, and are subiect vnto it, so in policy or worldly estates, there is such an order setled, that some should be aboue to commaund, others beneath to obey, and that they which are placed as inferiours, should submitthemselues to such, as by ranke and order are their superiours. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, it is more significant to say (<hi>be subiect</hi>) then if the Apostle should haue said, obey, reuerence, resist not, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, &amp;c. For subiection as a generall word, comprizeth all the rest as particulars vnder it, (namely) acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their power, taking lawes and coine from them, arming at their commaundement; reuerence, loue, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and thankesgiuing for them; thankfulnesse in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining them, obedience in doing and suffering, al these appertaine to subiection.</p>

                     <p>By [powers] are meant heere, not Ecclesiasticall Gouernors, as Apostles, Euangelists, Doctors, Pastors,<note place="margin">Powers.</note> Teachers, but such as take tribute, and beare the sword, which Ministers are forbid to doe, and ciuill rulers may do; and therefore the Papists erre, which from this place would set vp the preheminency of Pope and Byshops a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue politicke Rulers (who by a Metonymie of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioynt) are heere named [powers,] because they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with great power and might aboue other men, to suppresse the wicked and defend the good. Also to shew that they beare the Image of God, not in respect of his essence, but in respect of his power, and thence it is, that not <hi>Iehouah,</hi> the Title of his Being; but <hi>Elohim</hi> the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of his power, is attributed to the Magistrate, Psal. 82
<pb n="1076" facs="tcp:20835:536"/>
1, 5. Obserue also, that subiectes may not examine by what way or meane Princes get their power, whether by right or wrong, for <hi>Paul</hi> knew that the Romanes had by great force made themselues the Lords of the world, yet he will haue the present powers obeyed.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, <hi>Paul</hi> speaks not of the persons, but of the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which must be respected, be the Gouernors good or bad. Mens deformities cannot extinguish Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; nor can diuine functions be lesse honorable by humane frailties: it is a grosse malice or blindnesse not to distinguish the sins of the man, and the worthines of the Magistracy.</p>

                     <p>In these words, and the verses following, he rendreth sundry and weighty reasons why we ought to be subiect to Magistrates, whereof the first is taken from the efficient cause and author, which is neither for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, nor chance, nor men, nor Angels, good or badde, but onely God himselfe, whose ordinance we are bound to reuerence, and be subiect to it; but powers or magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates are Gods ordinance, therefore we must bee sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to them. This is the first argument which may bee thus further pressed and vrged. It is a comely and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest thing to submit our selues vnto that order which comes from God, who is not the authour of any thing that is euill: therefore, seeing Magistracie is a thing which God hath set amongst men, it is a seemly and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest thing to submit our selues vnto it.</p>

kindes of powers, and that they come all of God theyr first Author, because he saith in the plurall number (the powers that be) are ordained of God, which propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on beeing vniuersall, shewes that the former exclusiue proposition (no powers but of God) comprehends al, &amp; is as much in effect, as if the Apostle had saide al powers, both high, middle or low, Priuate or publicke, ciuill or<note place="margin">The kinds of power.</note> Ecclesiasticall, or whatsoeuer powers it bee, haue God for the ordainer thereof. Heere let vs obserue for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction sake, that from the verie beginning of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, God gaue vnto man a threefold power. First, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer himselfe, which is the rule of vncorrupt reason ouer our senses and appetite in the soule of man, and may bee likened vnto that gouernement which the Maister hath ouer his Schollers: of this it is written, Eccle. 7, 23. <hi>That God made man righteous.</hi> And in Ecclesiasticus 15. <hi>He left him in the hands of his owne counsell:</hi> and as <hi>Moses</hi> speakes Deut. 30, 19. <hi>He set before him life and death, good &amp; euill.</hi> Man is not like a stone or blocke (which cannot mooue but from an externall cause mouing it) but hath in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the beginning of motion, whereby he could by the power of his will, apply himselfe vnto good or euill, to chuse or refuse, til by abusing his free wil, in not refusing to eate the forbidden fruite, he lost both it and himselfe. The second power giuen to man in his first creation, was ouer Beastes, and Foules, and Fishes, according as it is written, Genes. 1, 26. <hi>Let him rule ouer the fishes of the Sea, &amp;c.</hi> Heere unto accordeth that in the Psal. 8, 6, 7. 8.

<pb n="1078" facs="tcp:20835:537"/>
power of maisters ouer their seruants, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> Ephe. 6, 5, 6, 7. Col. 4, 1. after this did spring vp the power of the Magistrate ouer subiects, when the world was multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed: this was established in Gen. 9, 5. which power bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be exercised not rashly by euery man, (which would breed a confusion (whereof God is not the author) doth argue that it is appropriate to certaine men whom God hath ordained to be Rulers ouer others: see Exod. 18, 21. and 20, 12. Deutero. 1, 15, 16, 17. and 16. 18. Now this publike power of the Magistrate was eyther of one ouer a kingdome, called a Monarchy; or else of some chiefe and choice men for wisedom and goodnesse put ouer the rest, called an Aristocracy; or exercised by a multitude called a Democracy. In these seuerall kindes of power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, howsoeuer the acquisition or assuming of it, bee not alwayes of God, as in Tyrants and vsurpers, which by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence and force doe intrude themselues into gouernment without a due calling, after the example of <hi>Nimrod,</hi> and the first Romane Emperors, and <hi>Richard</hi> the third in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and though the abuse of the power beeing carried not after the will of God, but after the lust of man, and being vsed not for the weale, but to the hurt of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, be not of God but from Sathan and wicked men: yet the very power it selfe considered alone, is certainly a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine ordinance erected &amp; appointed of God for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good of mankinde; as riches and marriage bee good though often they be ill gotten and ill vsed: therefore our Apostle not speaking of the person nor of the abuse, nor of the manner of getting the authority, but of the verye thing it selse, saith it is of God. This beeing generally true of all powers, yet is heere especially meant of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticall publike power, as appeareth by that which is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward saide of the sword, and of tribute paying.</p>

                     <p>This must not bee taken causually, as if that men were the first inuenters and finders out of ciuill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, but powers are named humane ordinances, eyther subiectiuely, because that man is the subiecte by whome it is exercised; or obiectiuely, because humane affaires are the onely obiect, or the thing about which it is conuersant. Lastly, also in respect of the ende, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause

it is appointed, &amp; doth serue for the great good of men.

                     <p>So then to conclude, those powers are from God, not as plagues, sicknesse, and other euils where with GOD scourges the wicked onely in his furie, but as an whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some order, tending to the benefit of good and bad, to reclaime the one from euill, and to retaine the other in his goodnesse.</p>

                     <p>First, an admonition to such as haue any power<note place="margin">Vse.</note> to vse it rightly, seeing they both haue it from God, and they must be countable to God how they vse it. That which <hi>Paul</hi> sayes of Maisters, must be applyed vnto all Magistrates, Col. 4, 1. They haue a Maister in heauen, &amp; therefore must deale equally and iustly. For power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thing which God hath ordained, it must needes therfore be bounded within the limits of reason, honesty and right; without the which, it may in no wise passe without offence to God the ordainer.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it puts subiects in minde, as to thank God for setting vp such an order, so to be subiect vnto it in al quietnes, euen for that reuerence and respect they beare to God the author of it. It cannot be but a thing excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding pleasing vnto God, when for his sake his ordinance is acknowledged, receiued, and regarded. Lastly, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes such as will obey none but higher powers onely, whereas subiection is here called for to al powers (which we do liue vnder) because their institution proceedeth from God.</p>

                     <p>His next reason is drawne (<hi>a turpi,</hi>) for it is a
<pb n="1081" facs="tcp:20835:538"/>
thing verie vnseemely and vnhonest, to striue against God, and that which he ordaines: therefore, it is verie<note place="margin">2. Reason.</note> filthy and vncomely to resist Magistrates, for they are<note place="margin">How Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates may be resisted.</note> Gods ordinance. Now Magistrates may be resisted these three wayes. First, by subtilty and craft, when by euill reports, and misse informations of seruants and officers they are drawne to doe against Iustice, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Mephibosheth</hi> by the false accusation of <hi>Zhiba.</hi> This is the misery of Princes (as one saith) that they haue neither eyes nor cares of their owne, but are forced to see and heare by other, who abusing them by vntrueths,<note place="margin">A good wary, &amp; wise prince is oftentimes sold.</note> cary them to wrong and oppression. Another was wont to say, that honest simple Princes are often sold by their owne seruants, who take Bribes to corrupt rheir May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters with lies: this is a cunning resistance; vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of pleasing and humoring, they do much wrong to Rulers and people both.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, there is a resistance by disobedience or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy (for resisting is opposed vnto subiection) when the lawfull commandement of Rulers, is not with readie submission fulfilled, their good I awes and statutes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout things lawfull, bee broken through contempt and negligence: this is a stubborne resistance.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, there is a mutinous resistance by seditious persons and rebels, which openly striue against autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram</hi> did; or beare armor against them, as <hi>Absolen</hi> &amp; English fugitiues haue done. Lastly, they doe resist, which are as bellowes by worde or writing, to perswade others to Rebellion, as <hi>Parsons, Sanders,</hi> Cardinall <hi>Allen,</hi> &amp; other Seminary Priests haue done. At a word, all authors, abettors, counsellers, fauo, rers, and consenters vnto sedition and rebellion, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Rulers, bee resisters of God in Magistrates.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>What is our doctrine from this second reason?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That such as resist authority, are resisters not of men, but of God, as the Poets faine of the Gyantes that raised vp a mount to heauen, to pull downe <hi>Iupiter</hi> from
<pb n="1082" facs="tcp:20835:539"/>
thence; so al resisters of powers are fighters against God. The reason of this doctrine is, because they that striue against the order that God hath set vp, striue against god the author of that order, and it is a signe that they would not haue God reigne ouer them that will not obey such Rulers as he hath appointed to be in his roome &amp; place. As Kings do take themselues to bee abused, when theyr deputies are abused: so the abuse of Gods Vice-gerents and Officers extends euen to God himselfe, as it written of <hi>Corah</hi> and his accomplices, that they murmured not against <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> but against God, Numbers 16. And <hi>they haue not cast off thee, but me</hi> (saith God vnto <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> when the people refused him to be their Ruler, 1. Sam. 8, 7.) Howsoeuer men list to thinke otherwise of the matter, yet rulers being in Gods stead set vp at his owne command, cloathed with his name and power, it cannot be, but they which resist them in any degree, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist God himselfe in violating a diuine order: yet let this be noted, that when rulers are oppressors subiects may (by honest meanes) preserue themselues from comming into their hands, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did from <hi>Saul;</hi> and also make appellation from inferiour rulers, abusing their places, to superiour rulers, as <hi>Paul</hi> did to <hi>Caesar.</hi> Neither must wee thinke disobedience to rulers in things that are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust and impious, to be any resistance of power, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects are ready with patience to endure the punishment, though wrongfully inflicted, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> and the other Apostles did, Actes 5, and 4. and 16. also the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs in the Heathen Emperours times, and in our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, to settle our mindes the better to submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of all kinde of authority by this meditation, that we shall shew our selues thereby to be louers and friends to God, and to his owne order, and enemies vnto confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Secondly, to condemne such of folly and madnesse, which withstand rulers in things lawfull or indifferent.
<pb n="1083" facs="tcp:20835:539"/>
For this is all one, as if one should rise vp against GOD, the creature against the Creator, the pot and the thing made against the potter &amp; the maker, then which what can be more sottish and foolish? and yet this they doe, which striue against mightier and better then the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, which must needs in the end turne to their owne ruine, as the Apostle reasons in the third place.</p>

                     <p>It is this, that they that resist, purchase to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues damnation, that is, either eternall damnation in hell, or temporall punnishment in this life; either from the hands of the Magistrate, or immediately from God himselfe, as it happened to <hi>Corah</hi> consumed with fire; to <hi>Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> swallowed vp by the earth; and to <hi>Absolon</hi> who was hanged by the haire of the head, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable other traitors at home and abroad: vnto all which, did befall an vnhappy and fearefull end: as in our Nation, euen in our memory (as well as in former ages) verie many of all sorts, haue for their disloyalty &amp; trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, left their liues at Tower hill and Tyburne, beeing denied most of them the honour of buriall, their bodies hanged vp for the Birds of the ayre to feede on. It were to bee wished these harmes might bee other mens war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, that such as liue well and obediently to good lawes, neede not to bee affraide of Magistrates, or of his punishments threatned by lawes. The truth is, good men must still feare Gouernors and lawes with a reuerent feare such as children haue towards their parents, Prouer. 24, 21. Rom. 12, 7. But a perplexed and seruile terror pertaineth not to them; this is the benefit of their obedience to good lawes, to enfree their mindes from such a feare as malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors haue, whose feare is a continuall tormentor: and to make Rulers not terrible, but amiable to them; yet feare of punishment is not profitable for them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we learne that if vile persons be punished for their disobedience and disorder, they haue cause to blame themselues and their ill doings, but may not accuse the Ruler of the harmes which they suffer: for all men by light of nature doe know, that to euill deeds, euill and paine is due, and that society of men could not continue where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be not giuen after mens deserts. Therefore if they runne into known crimes, and haue demerited punishment for disobedient resisting Rulers, they must thanke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and acquite the Ruler who doth but that which is
<pb n="1086" facs="tcp:20835:541"/>
equall and iust, to maintaine lawes and publike peace, and to bridle the enemies thereof.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, hence Magistrates may learne the bounds of their power, which is not indifferently to terrifie all good and euill, or to winke at offendors, and afflict well-doers. For this is the abuse of power, and they which doe thus shall purchase iudgement to themselues, from the hand of supreame power, who is terrible euen to earthly powers if they abuse their office by beating the iust, or bearing with the vniust. For it is equally abhomination vnto God to condemne an innocent, or to absolue and iustifie the wicked, to whom the Ruler must bee terrible. Hence it followes, that sithence Rulers must suppresse euill dooers, they must be men of courage, because euill men with their malice haue both might and friends oftentimes. Hence they are called oppressors, Psalme 72. 3. and lob 29, 17. Also that in Rulers there is required diligence in search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and iudgement in discerning of mens persons and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses which come before them, to be able to know who doe well according to right and law, and who doe ill contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to equity and honesty, and what penalties belong to seuerall offences, which are brought to their hearing and examination.</p>

                     <p>But if the Rulers be fearefull and breed terror, will<note place="margin">Doubt.</note> not this cause them to bee hated and abhorred? for men hate whom they feare, and what is such an enemy to vertue as feare, or such a spurre to wickednesse?</p>

to terror and reuenge, shewes that vnder it is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended freedome from condemnation and punishment, absolution from crimes falsely obiected, approbation of their obedience, with some publike reward and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, for their encouragement, and for exciting others to duty: moreouer defence and protection, quiet posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of life, goods, estate: and finally praise and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; all this is contained vnder praise, and is the fruite of subiection.</p>

                     <p>That is a fault not in the powers, but in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which abuse the power: againe, <hi>Paul</hi> sets downe not alwaies what is done by Rulers, but what should be done. Lastly, if well doers misse praise from men, they are sure to haue it from God: and euill Rulers when they doe not praise good men causally, by giuing them their due com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, yet they do it occasionly, whilst by punishing good men vniustly, they minister occasion to them, to shew forth their patience to their praise and glory. Power to hurt is giuen to diuels and wicked men, that the patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of good men may be proued to their praise.</p>

                     <p>It is a great spurre to subiection, to heare that such as do well, shall receiue praise, and so much good: for all men do desire good things, and couet to be well spoken of. Secondly, it reprooues such Rulers as look to their owne priuate ends, and not to the publicke good; such as waste the common treasure, spoile and waste the subiects, neglect the obseruation of good Lawes, &amp; the encouragement of vertuously disposed persons, giuing heart by remission and conniuence to the euill, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartning the good. Thirdly, it admonisheth al rulers, with all care and conscience to aunswere their high au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; as they are Gods Ministers, so to do Gods will, and to approue their doings to God, to seeke his honor in their office, remembring that to him they must render

account, and aboue all to vphold the purity of doctrine and diuine worship, after the examples of <hi>Ioshua, Dauid, Iosiah, Iehosaphat, Ezekiah,</hi> and other godly Emperours and Kings. Lastly, it must prouoke vs to the greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence towards them, being Gods officers and Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: in respecting, louing, obeying them for Gods sake we must declare our reuerence, loue, and obedience to God himselfe.</p>

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the principall matter in hand touching subiection: We ought willingly (not for feare onely) be subiect to them which are helpfull to all mankinde.

But Powers or rulers are beneficiall to mankinde, not onely for prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and defending the good, but for brideling and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing the euill, verse 3, and 4. Therefore, not for feare of wrath onely, bvt for conscience sake we ought to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey them, verse 5. for it is against conscience to resist &amp; grieue such benefactors as gouernors be. The proofe of the assumption or minor is, because to powers is giuen authority to beare and vse the sword, both for protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the innocent by lawfull warres, and reuenging the malefactor by corporall paines, and death if neede bee.

are many euil deeds sorbiden in Gods law, which Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates can take no knowledge of, or cannot call vnto an account to punish, as euill thoughtes, and manie totten words and vaine actions; therefore criminall and capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall faults be meant.

                     <p>That innocent persons are dreadlesse and bold, but breakers of Gods Law do go and liue in continuall terror, as Theeues, murtherers, traitors, dare not looke out. The reason is, because innocency is as a bulwarke and fortresse to the good, and the Lawes also &amp; powers are for their safegard; whereas the guilt of an euil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, is as a tormentor to the euill doer, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth powers and lawes to be ordained for scourging and curbing them. Hence it is, that the wicked and disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient liuers do feare and flie, and hide their heades, and seeke the darknesse to couer them, as <hi>Cain</hi> did &amp; as with vs Fellons and Malefactors do; when guiltlesse persons are fearlesse and confident, and shunne not the light, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they haue not done euill against lawes. The three seruants of God, being conuented before the King, and sore threatned, saide; <hi>O King we are not affraide to answer thee,</hi> Dan. 3, 16. <hi>Iohn</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> (Acts 4, 13.) being broght before the Rulers, so stoutly answered (out of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their cause and conscience) as the Elders and Priests admired to see vnlettered men so bold; whereas euill men commonly shake and tremble in the presence of the Magistrate, and look pale as if death were in their faces, because guilt is in their conscience. This serues to be a notable spur to subiection, to cause vs to walk obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently towards Rulers in all ready subiection to Lawes and orders well established for publicke good, that wee may enioy that freedome from perplexed &amp; slauish feare, which as a Ghost or fiend doth follow euill doers, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet and vexe them, liuing in continual feare and dread

                     <p>This is not spoken of an ecclesiasticall or spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall sword, which is by the hands of God himselfe put into the hands of Church officers, whereof <hi>Paul</hi> entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before, Chap. 12. verse 7, 8. Heere he speakes of ciuil officers, to whom custome and tribute are payde; and therefore this must be vnderstoode of a materiall sword, by which he meaneth (Mctonymically) the right &amp; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of drawing the sword for good subiectes against e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill ones, and (Synecdochically) armor and weapons of all kindes, together with all coactiue and coercitiue po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer whatsoeuer, is to be exercised for the safety of the body polliticke, and the suppression of all enemies ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, either domesticall and intestine, or forreigne.

This sworde is saide not to bee [borne in vaine] in two sences. First, hee beareth it not rashly. Secondly, or not without cause or end.

                     <p>Two: First, the power and vse of the sword doth belong, yea it is proper to the ciuil Magistrate to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it
<pb n="1092" facs="tcp:20835:544"/>
granted of God (and not to the Minister of the worde) to be as it were the very sinnews and strength of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. A Minister may weare, but not beare a sworde. <hi>Peter</hi> may shew the sword, and offer to strike with it, but Christ will both command him to put it into his sheath, and tell him further, that he shall perish with the sword if he take it. [Take it] shewes that the sword in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters hand is taken and vsurped. It is not put there and giuen of God, and therefore without their perill, yea, without perill of perishing, cannot be assumed of them. For all this, and notwithstanding Christ haue in Lu. 22, 25. plainly distinguished betweene ciuill and ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call power, as touching external rule and regiment, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (<hi>but you not so,</hi>) that is, shall not vse such manner of Titles and Regiments as Kings do; yet the Pope and his Prelates intrude vpon this right of ciuill Rulers, &amp; chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to themselues the power of both swords, yea and execute temporall iurisdiction, as well as spirituall. On the other side, the Anabaptistes offend in the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame, denying vnto Christian Rulers all power &amp; vse of the sworde. Wherein they crosse the manifest Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and also what lyeth in them ouerthrowe humane policy, and so deserue punishment, as violaters and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbers of Gods order, and mans society, by denying such a necessary help, as without which, any good lawes cannot be made nor executed, neither in peace nor war; the euil docr ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be restrained, nor the obedient sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect and Citizen maintained without the sword.</p>

                     <p>What then is the second doctrine from these words?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Such as haue the power of the sword, they must not haue it in vaine, and for nothing; they are bound to make vse of it, and to conuert it to the right endes for which God did ordaine and giue it. Whereof one reason is, that it is the will of God that it should not bee borne idlely, being suffered to rust in the sheath. Secondly, it standeth with the office of the Ruler, vppon occasion to draw it out on Gods behalfe, &amp; in his stead (whose mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
<pb n="1093" facs="tcp:20835:544"/>
and seruants they be) to take vengeance and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment on such as doe offend: so as not to vse it, is to frustrate Gods institution, and to do against their owne duty. The Church, the Families, the Schools, haue their swords to fight withall: the Church hath the word of God, that two edged sword, Heb, 4, 12. <hi>The sworde of the Spirit,</hi> Ephe. 6, 17. The chastising rod is in stead of a sword vnto the Father, and Schoole-maister. As all these are bound to make a right vse of the sword, by right Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and corrections, without conniuence or cruelty; &amp; if they should by remisse or slack vse of their power, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer sinne and vices to grow and encrease in church, house or schoole, they should deserue blame, and were woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy themselues to be beaten, because they do not what they may to hinder the breed and multiplication of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities: so much more (as his power is great, &amp; the hurt more) the Magistrate is blame-worthy, if he be carelesse and will not, or fearfull and dare not conuert his power of punnishing, to the hinderance of enormities in the Commonwealth. For by impunity sinne will waxe impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and fruitfull. It will boldly spreade it selfe in al pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where it is not checked &amp; controuled, like a shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Strumpet; and it wil fall out in the reckoning, that Rulers will be found culpable and guilty of such crimes, as by his softnesse and sufferance be committed. For with God it is much one, whether one bee a dooer of euill, or no hinderer, and so a consenter and a fosterer. On the otherside, by the diligent and conscionable vse of the sword, not onely the Ruler is discharged, but there is a terror stricken into the hearts of euill men, which staies them from running headlong to vice, as <hi>Salomon</hi> saith, <hi>The blewnesse of the wound driueth out euill.</hi> And Deut. 18. <hi>Crimes must be punished by the Iudge, that the rest may feare and do no such euill.</hi> Also 1 Tim. 5, 24. scandalous Ministers must be openly rebuked, that others may be terrified: so as there is a double benefite comes by correcting vices, according to their quality. One, the reformation of the
<pb n="1094" facs="tcp:20835:545"/>
offender, as the theese on the Crosse was reclaimed by his paine: and secondly the restraint of others that would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, were they not feared by example of punishment.</p>
                     <p>Thus as the body by purging out noxious humors, the garden by weeding, the flocke by tarring scabbed sheepe be kept sound, cleane &amp; heathfull: so the commonwealth is purged of much euill, and preserued from infection of vices by seuere punishments. To these we may adde a third commodity of the sword, that (as <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith) it makes the wayes of vertue easie, when to the vertuous life of the Ruler there is added the impulsion and force of lawes well executed. This brought many Donatists from that wicked secte to imbrace the Catholike truth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon <hi>Augustine</hi> corrected his error, touching the not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing of heretickes. Lastly, in that they are entituled the Ministers of God: let this helpe to nourish reuerence towards them, to haue them in good reputation for the Lords sake, 1. Pet. 2, 13. Secondly, let it assure Rulers they shall not lacke Gods assistance and protection, see Ioshua 1, 5, 6, 7. If kings will maintaine their Iudges, She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffes, Iustices, and these doe beare out their vnder-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers doing but their duties, yea to the punishing of such as resist or make rescues: How can it bee that God should cast off the care and defence of his Ministers and seruants, executing but his iudgements? he will certainly be a shield and a bucklet to such shields of the earth (so the Psalmist calles Rulers) as be found vpright and valiant.</p>

                     <p>It containeth a conclusion of the former exhortation touching subiection vnto Magistrates, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are to obserue these three things: First, a repetition of two maine arguments, the former (<hi>à metu poenae</hi>) because
<pb n="1095" facs="tcp:20835:545"/>
of wrath. The second (<hi>à metu Dei</hi>) for conscience sake, that is, least wee hurt our conscience by offending God who sets Rulers ouer vs and commands vs to obey them. The second part is an addition of two new arguments, first from necessity, (yee must bee subiect,) the second from c<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity (render to euery man his due,) this is <hi>regula aequita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis &amp; iuris.</hi>) The third and last member of the texte is an enumeration of the parts of subiection, which bee these foure, 1. feare, 2. honour, 3. tribute, 4. custome. Of the last two, there are two reasons yeelded in the texte, why they ought to be paide, fust (<hi>à testimonio</hi>) because they bee secret witnesses of subiection (<hi>for, this cause ye pay tribute.</hi>) Secondly, (<hi>ab honesto</hi>) because it is an honest thing to giue recompence to the Magistrate for his labour and paines (applying themselues to this purpose.)</p>

                     <p>Wrath signifies that punishment or reuenge men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned verse 4. because it proceeds from the wrath or an ger both of God and the Magistrate, which because men can no otherwise auoide then by subiection, therfore heere is the necessity of subiection. But especially [<hi>for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science sake,</hi>] which words haue sundry interpretations all true, but not all fit to the text: Some by conscience vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the light of naturall reason, which teacheth vs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der euery man his due, as <hi>Liranus.</hi> Or the conscience of such sinnes as disobedient persons may fall into, through their disobedience, as <hi>Tolet</hi> thinketh. Or the conscience of other men, that it bee not hurt by example of our obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy against Rulers, as <hi>Erasmus.</hi> Or the conscience of such benefits as we receiue by the meanes of Rulers, whereof in verse 4. Or thus, it is against conscience to resist such Benefactors as protect the good, and punish the euill doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as <hi>Chrysostome.</hi> Or the pricke that doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of rebellious persons. Now there bee two things which doe (like furies) sting the conscience of such: First, the contempt of the good ordinance of God. Secondly,
<pb n="1096" facs="tcp:20835:546"/>
ingratitude towards Rulerss which made all mankinde beholden to them. Thus <hi>Peter Martyr:</hi> but Maister <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> and <hi>Piscator</hi> do interprete it, <hi>De metu Dei &amp; conscientia praecepti,</hi> because God hath ordained Rulers and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded subiection, therefore wee cannot with a good conscience despise or resist them. Albeit I woulde not willingly cast off any of these interpretations, yet for diuers circumstances of the text, I doe rather encline to that of <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and this last of Maister <hi>Beza,</hi> as the rightest and fittest, because hee had spoken of Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and the good vse of Rulers, in regard whereof, there is conscience to be made of subiection to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate.</p>

                     <p>That to giue subiection to Rulers is no indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thing to bee done at our pleasure, as a thing at our owne election: we are bound to be subiect, as either we will escape punishment, or keepe our conscience vnto Godward vnspotted. If we be not subiect, wee incurre Gods wrath, we make shipwrack of a good conscience, two of the greatest euils, and therefore we must needes be subiect, by which meanes, wee shall enioy Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, and the peace of a good conscience, which are two of the chiefest good things. Secondly, were we sure to auoyde both the wrath of God, and the punnishment of the rulers, yet we ought to be subiect vnto them, that we may preserue an vncorrupt conscience, which is a farre greater benefit then to auoide corporall paine. Thirdly, our externall obedience is not sufficient, vnlesse it bee ioyned with subiection of conscience: not to speake e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill with our tongues, nor with our handes to resist the Magistrate, is then a Christian action, when in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science we reuerence rulers. As this reprooues such peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that are subiect not in singlenesse of heart, but with eye-subiection, so it exhorts vs in performing subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not to set our members aworke onely, but to do our
<pb n="1097" facs="tcp:20835:546"/>
duty to superiors of conscience to God; otherwise there may be fruite of our subiection vnto Rulers, but none to our selues before God.</p>

                     <p>But may it be rightly collected from this text, that the<note place="margin">Doubt.</note> Lawes of men do as truely, absolutely, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <p>No verily: this is the prerogatiue of God, that<note place="margin">Solution.</note> he is alone the Lawgiuer to the conscience Iam. 2. <hi>There is one Law-giuer, euen God.</hi> God alone is the Lord of the Conscience, 1. for he made it, 2. he gouernes it, 3. &amp; he alone is able to saue or destroy it, for breach of his laws: and therefore his lawes haue absolute and proper power to binde the conscience of such as breake them, to sinne and damnation. Wheras mens Lawes do binde our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, it is not through any power of themselues, but by vertue of Gods Law, commanding vs to bee subiect vnto them; and of the things commanded, being agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to diuine Lawes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if mens Lawes should properly binde (as they be mans) then the Midwiues disobeying <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Exod. 1. and the three Hebrues disobeying <hi>

                        </hi> about falling down to the Image, Dan. 3. had sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against Conscience: whereas their example is in Scripture commended for our imitation. Also then, <hi>Peter Iames,</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> had not giuen a sound answere vnto the Rulers, forbidding them to preach, saying, <hi>It is better to obey God then men.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, both the Ministers and the people of Christ, should be equally bound to studie humane Lawes, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine, which were an absurde thing: also then humane Lawes should be as perfect as diuine, whereunto as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is to be added, so nothing is to bee taken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, there being no Tribunall seate, sauing that of God in heauen, higher and greater then that Tribunall which is set vp in our conscience on earth: If the Law of man (as it is of man) could binde the Conscience, then
<pb n="1098" facs="tcp:20835:547"/>
it would follow, that inferiour power might prescribe and ouerrule the superiour.</p>
                     <p>These things serue to discouer the intollerable pride of that man of sinne, the Pope of Rome, challenging to himselfe that which is peculiar vnto God, euen a Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne rule ouer the conscience, which hee will haue as much obliged vnto his Ecclesiasticall Lawes, as vnto Gods morall Precepts, so as men shall sinne mortally, &amp; become worthy of eternall death, if they breake any Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall constitution, euen therefore because they bee his constitutions. Thus <hi>Pererius</hi> the Iesuite affirmes: but <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> in his Chapter <hi>de pontifice</hi> goeth yet further, that if the Pope should commend for vertues such thinges as are vices, men are as much bound in conscience to obey them, as if they were lawful things commanded of God: and no maruaile, seeing they ascribe vnto the Pope om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency, and acknowledge him to be a God. But what is this, but to fulfill the prophesie of Antichrist by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Thes. 2, 2. to sit in the Temple of God, as God; &amp; to lift vp himselfe aboue all that is called God? For the Conscience is Gods Temple, and subiect vnto none but to God, according to that, <hi>Giue vnto God the thinges that are Gods,</hi> Mat. 22.</p>

                     <p>Yea, we are in Conscience bound to obey hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane<note place="margin">Solution.</note> Lawes, or els we run into the offence of God, and so offend our Conscience. This is the very meaning of our Text; for if we must obey for Conscience sake, then Rulers and Lawes do in some sort binde our conscience. Againe, this Commaundement [be subiect vnto higher powers] cannot bee broken with a good Conscience. Therfore we are in conscience bound to do such things as are enioyned vs by rulers, with this condition, that the thing enioyned bee not contrary to common hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, equity, reason, and religion. For further explanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this point, obserue that the Lawe of ciuill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
<pb n="1099" facs="tcp:20835:547"/>
do forbid and require sometimes the selfe-same thing that Gods Law doth forbid and require; as Vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, drunkennesse, periury, theft, murder: and then wee obey not in respect of men, but for diuine precept sake, the things commanded being such as we cannot but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, vnlesse we would wound our Conscience: but if the things inioyned, be indifferent of a middle Nature, neither prohibited by Gods Law, nor exacted, yet then we are to obey in Conscience, not of the thinges them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, but first of the generall precept, <hi>Honour the King, submit your selues to Principalities, be subiect to powers, &amp;c.</hi> Se condly, in respect of the end which the ruler propounds vnto himselfe, and that is externall peace, order, come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, honesty, which being morally good things, wee are therefore in Conscience bound not to violate them. Thirdly, in regard of certaine accidents which do acom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the breach of human lawes, as disloyalty, contempt of Rulers, scandal to our neighbors; which being things morally euill, therefore when any of them doe yssue for our neglect of ciuill Lawes, then the conscience is hurt and sinne is committed, though the things whereon the Lawes were made, be but indifferent.</p>
                     <p>Finally, if humane lawes be such, as do determine of circumstances, which be means the better to maintain &amp; obserue Gods moral Law, as touching time and place of diuine worshippe, and concerning the not wearing of Dagges, Swords, Gunnes, to auoyde murther; or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in meats, drinkes, apparrell, &amp;c. to auoide in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperancy: in these thinges, it behooues vs to make Conscience that we do not offend, because God himselfe hath bound vs to the exercise of all meanes and helpes, whereby any vertue may bee exercised, or any Vice es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chewed.</p>

                     <p>Now <hi>Paul</hi> reasoneth from their owne testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as if he should say, in that you pay tribute, in this you
<pb n="1100" facs="tcp:20835:548"/>
witnes, that you do owe subiection to Rulers, euen (for this cause) that you may auoide wrath, and keep a good conscience. By Tribute, is meant such paiments as the people contributed to their Rulers, and were brought into the Kings Exchequer (as one would say, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities exported or imported) thence called, <hi>Phoros apo tou phérein,</hi> or <hi>prosphérein.</hi> Tribute herein differs from customes, which are imposts and payments, either paide by the polle, man by man, or according to mens seueral substances, immoueables, things, lands, or mooueables, as Merchandize. Note further, that he saith not [ye giue] but [ye pay] tribute, to teach, that Tributes are not gifts but debts; not things freely bestowed, but of duty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; as it is written in the beginning of the seauenth verse, <hi>Render to euery man his duty.</hi> And whereas our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, writing to all beleeuing <hi>Romanes</hi> (whereof some were Ministers, some were people) and vniuersally saith to them all, <hi>yee pay Tribute:</hi> This sheweth, that no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons Ecclesiastical or Ciuill, be exempted from this part of subiection of paying Tribute, vnlesse where there is immunity granted by the bounty of the King.</p>

                     <p>That it is a duty by God himselfe laide vpon all sorts of subiects, willingly to pay vsuall customes and tributes vnto their Princes. The Reasons of this duty be<note place="margin">Reasons.</note> these. First, to testifie and declare our subiection toward powers, that we acknoledge them to be our lawful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors, and that we haue them in singular account, as men set ouer vs by God, for whose sake wee pay them tribute, subsidies, and customes. Secondly, to maintaine and vphold the publicke charge that Princes are put to, about the publicke tranquillity. Whence it is, that by <hi>Vlpian,</hi> tributes are tearmed <hi>neruireipublica,</hi> for that no more a body can be preserued without sinnewes, then a Commonwealth without tribute. Now reason would, that euery man should bee burdened about the vphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that, wherein euery man hath an interest &amp; pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
<pb n="1101" facs="tcp:20835:548"/>
charge to be defraid by publike purse, euery man his share according to his meanes; many hands wil make light labour.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, tributes are to be paide as a recompence vnto Maistrates for their great paines, for they must apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues (as the text saith, verse 6.) to this purpose, that is, with all their study, care, and might they must serue to take vengeance on the euill, and to recompence the good, to vse the sword for making of lawes, for maintenance of peace, execution of iustice, and waging of warres: these be matters of great waight, charge, and difficulty, of much paine and perill, which made the Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> to know that the life of a Rusticke is to bee preferred before the life of a Ruler, who is a seruant to all, to watch when other men sleepe, to trauaile abroad when other men stay at home, to purchase other mens ease and safety with their owne disquiet and danger. Which made a certaine wise man to say, that if a Crowne lay on the ground, he would not stoop to take it vp, it had so many cares annexed to it. In respect whereof, Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> spake it openly in the Parliament house, that she had rather bee a milke-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man then a Queene, were it not more for her subiects sake then her owne. And of a certaine Romane wee reade that long aspiring to be Emperor, hee was not so forward to haue it, as feeling the burthen he was willing to cast it off, yea moaned and complained of the burthen of it, that it was heauy. If this matter were throughly considered, it may restraine many men from aspiring to places of gouern ment, which are ioyned with so many and so great incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances and troubles, if their duty be thorowly done: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so it would preuaile with subiects to encourage the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grudging and murmuring, willingly, yea cheerefully to bring in all such payments which are reasonable and necessarily imposed vpon them for the publike good, or for the sustentation of publike persons: Such as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to pay, doe heereby deserue rebuke. Withall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by are reproued our Romanists which both (<hi>de facto &amp;
<pb n="1102" facs="tcp:20835:549"/>
iure</hi>) exempt the persons of the Clergy in criminall causes from ciuill tryals, and their goods from ciuill payments, according to a decree of <hi>Boniface</hi> the 8. and the corrupte opinion of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that the Clergy is exempt in person and goods by donation of Princes: and of <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> that the law of nature hath freed the Clergy, though Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had not cleared them. But all this is quite contrary to the law of God, who requires euery soule to be subiect, v. 1. and tribute is a part of subiection, verse 6. Secondly, to the example of Christ &amp; his Apostles, who paide polle mony, Mat. 17. Thirdly, to the lawe of reason and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which teacheth that members of a common-wealth and such as partake of the benefit of Gouernors, should in common maintaine gouernemnt, it beeing vnreasonable that when others are burthened, Ministers should be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, hauing mony, lands, and possessions aswell as others, (alwayes excepting such immunities as they enioy lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,) and some where in that proportion, as were they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted, Princes should loose the third part of their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, as now in <hi>Spaine,</hi> and was sometime in England.</p>

                     <p>This is the second generall part of this Chapter containing an exhortation to mutuall loue. It hath this coherence with the former matter, wherein hauing exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to render Magistrates their due particularly, hee nowe generally perswades all Christians to pay vnto all sorts of men whatsoeuer they owe them, not ceasing till they bee quit srom all debts: by which occasion he stirreth vs vp to pay the debt of charity; for if all debts must be paide, then must charity be exercised, because that is a debt, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for vs to the keeping of the law; which he proueth by these two reasons, one by the enumeration of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, verse 9. as thus: The particular precepts of the law are these, <hi>Thou shalt not commit adultery, &amp;c.</hi> but loue inableth vs to the keeping of these precepts, therefore is loue the fulfilling of the law: the assumption and conclusion of this argument are in the tenth verse. The second reason is, loue doth none euill, therefore it is the keeping of the law. Of these 2. reasons the former is drawn fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a profitable effect of loue, &amp; the latter from remouing of the contrary effect.</p>

                     <p>That it doth behooue euery Christian to haue an honest care for the payment of his debts of all kindes both ciuill and morall. This proposition needes explanation, confirmation, and application: I explaine it thus: it is a part of euery wise man so to liue if it be possible, as he may free himselfe from all pecuniary debts: First, that hee may not bee obnoxious to others, and the lesse bee his owne
<pb n="1104" facs="tcp:20835:550"/>
man. Secondly, the more a mans debt is, so the lesse is his substance. Thirdly, debt is a disquiet vnto an honest minde, and hath some apparance of discredit. Some, by debt hurt their name, their profession, and their poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie.</p>
                     <p>The best meanes to auoyde debts are these. First, fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality and moderation in expences, euer keeping vnder, rather <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For whereas diuers there be, who go ouer shooes and Bootes, yea and ouer eares too in debt; that fals out by ouer-eating and drinking, or by ouer building, or by ouer purchasing, or ouer cloathing themselues &amp; theyrs. Secondly, warinesse in contracts and bargaines. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by auoyding rash suretiship, when we know neither the men, nor their estate for whom we become pledges. In this there is much folly, and oftentimes the end ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is beggery, as <hi>Salomon</hi> in many places teacheth; so doth debts which commeth by gaming, and ryotous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, by eschewing to take money vpon Vsury; for that biteth (as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> word signifieth) &amp; gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth estate of many a man to the bare bone at last. But sithence it sareth so with many men, as it is hard for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to trade in the world without debt, in this case wee are charged by the Apostle, to make due and timely satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>

If thy debt be so great, and thy selfe so poore as thou beest not able, then after the counsell of the holy Ghost in the Prou. Chap. 6. verse 3. <hi>Go humble thy selfe, &amp;c.</hi> purpose restitution, promise to pay it when thou shalt be able: and if the Creditor bee dead, and the debt small, and no order left to exacte it,
<pb n="1105" facs="tcp:20835:550"/>
yet remember, that there is as good right to a peny, as to a pound, and what cannot be rendred to the creditor, pay it to his children, or the next of his Kindred, or in defect of such to the poore; for a Christians care must be, not to owe any thing to any man.</p>

                     <p>The lesser light of nature, teacheth vs to giue vnto euery man that which is his owne. Secondly, the greater light of the word, instructs vs to deale iustly, and it is a maine part of Iustice commutatiue to pay debtes. Thirdly by paying of debts we shall please God, &amp; finde him ready further to blesse vs. See the example of the Widdow, 2 Kings 4, 1, 2, 3.

Whereas on the contrarie, by liuing in debt carelesly, we offend God whose Law wee breake, we wound our Conscience by iniustice, we hurt our owne estimation, and slander our profession, causing men to speake hardly, not onely of our selues, but of the Gospell for our sakes. Lastly, we also incurre the penalty of the Law (to wit) imprisonment, and the paincs of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall death (to wit) hellish torment for our vnrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, 1 Cor. 6, 9.</p>

                     <p>First, it serueth for reproofe of such as runne in debt by borrowing, and do not meane to restore. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> of such as in payment of debtes are partiall, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying some, and not others, when as they haue where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to satisfy all. This is the case of many Bankerouts, which breake, that they may escape by paying by quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or halfes. Thirdly, of such as do pay, but it is grud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gingly, driuing their Creditors to recouer by Law, what was lent them in loue. All these are worse then Paganes or Iewes. For the Heathen Romanes so abhorted loose debters, as they made a Law to cut them in pieces, and
<pb n="1106" facs="tcp:20835:551"/>
to satisfie euery Creditor with a quarter. Wherunto the Gospell alludeth, in allotting punishment to the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull Steward, Math. 24, 51. The Iewes though som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what milder, yet seuere enough against wretchles deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who by their Law must bee solde, and themselues, their wiues and children, become slaues, to satisfy theyr Creditors, 1 Kings 4, 1. Secondly, heere is an exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto all persons, as tender either Conscience or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, and regarde either God or man, either present or future hurt, to be willing and ready, according to their meanes and power, to answere vnto euery man that they owe them, euen to the vtmost farthing, yea, although it cannot be done but to their owne impouerishing; consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering two things especially, 1. that a little with righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, is better then much with iniquity 2, and what hapned to the widdow that was careful to pay hir debts, her Oyle (by Gods Blessing) was encreased, till she had enough for the Creditor, and a remnant and remainder for her selfe and children to liue on, 2 Kings 4, 7. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit let this be done not for reputation to keepe credit, or for profit sake, that ye may be trusted againe: but of conscieace and obedience to that God which hath said, owe nothing to any man, that you may bee sure to bee comforted &amp; blessed in your deeds, as the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh in another case, Iames 1, 25.</p>

                     <p>Yes, it is to be extended to debts both naturall and morall, euen whensoeuer there is any obligation or bond, either of nature, as betweene Father and children, Husband and wife; or of religion, as betweene all other inferiours and superiours, whether Magistrates or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, &amp;c. all these are debters one to another. What <hi>Paul</hi> saith of himselfe, Rom. 1, 14. <hi>I am a debter to you Romanes, &amp;c.</hi> is true of all Superiors.

This consideration

that mutuall duties are so many, debts should much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke vs vnto serious performance. What man is there, that hath but common honesty, but will take care of his debts to pay them, and till the Booke be crossed, &amp; the bils canceld, will giue himselfe no quiet? Now, if wee take not to heart our mutuall duties to do them because they be debtes, what may this argue, but that wee are worse then honest ciuill men, hauing lost both the shame of the Worlde, and also the reuerence of Almightie GOD?</p>

                     <p>The debt of loue: for when the Apostle saith, [<hi>Owe nothing vnto any but loue,</hi>] it strongly implies that loue is a debt, yet such a debt it is, as in sundry thinges differs from ciuill debts, which are due but to some per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whereas loue is to be exercised towards all, friends, enemies, Infidels, and Christians. Secondly, other debts being paide, our substaunce is diminished, but loue by paying it to others, encreases in our selues <hi>reddendo mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiplicatur,</hi> as one saith. Thirdly, other debtes may bee paide while we liue, but this of loue cannot be satisfied in this life; it is due in heauen, both to God, to Angels, and to Saints, 1 Cor. 13, 13 Fourthly, debts of mony are to be paide at certaine times and places, but the debt of loue is due alwayes &amp; euery where. Fiftly, other debts may be dispensed withall, and forgiuen: but the debte of loue not so. Men cannot, and God will not discharge vs the practise of our loue, though he will forgiue the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> of our loues.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, other debts beeing once paide, are no more debts: but loue, although it be paide, is still due, it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in paying and euer owing because the groundes thereof bee perpetuall. First, the precept of GOD, <hi>Loue thy Neighbour as thy selfe,</hi> Math. 22. Secondly, our common Nature, euerie man being anothers flesh, Esay 58, 7. Pro. 11, 17. Thirdly, the image of God imprinted
<pb n="1108" facs="tcp:20835:552"/>
in our nature. Lastly, common profession, hauing all one Sauiour by grace (to wit) Christ, as wee haue all one fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by nature (to wit) <hi>Adam.</hi> Now fithence charity is a debt, and such a debt as we are all bound to pay, it stands euery man vpon that hath any conscience of this debt, to looke vnto all the particulars thereof, which beeing sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry and many, some things being due to the soule of our brother, as to comfort, exhort, rebuke, &amp;c. Other things due to his body, as to couer his nakednesse, feede his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, &amp;c. also we being debters to the dignity, life, chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, substance, and name of our neighbour, in none of these to impaire him, but in all to increase and preserue them what we can. This must moue vs both to pray for greater measure of grace, to be able to performe this better heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, and instantly to beg pardon of God through Christ for our failing heeretofore; for the debt of charity being neglected, doth increase the debt of sinne: and looke how much wee come short of paying the debt of loue, so much we multiply the debt of sinne; and therefore stand in need both of faith to beleeue the forgiuenesse of that which is past, &amp; of repentance to amend our liues for time to come, to walke henceforth in charity, dooing all our things in loue.</p>

By fulfilling is meant heere not the exact keeping in euery point without any swaruing, but the careful endeuour to do one commandement as well as another, without baulking any of them.

                     <p>This ought very much to kindle our loue, seeing it is such a helpe to the fulfilling of the lawe, then which there is nothing except faith in Christ, eyther of more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and beauty, or of more profite and benefit then to be keepers of the lawe: by which first wee haue <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Againe, our study to walke in the law, is both a signe of a blessed man, and the way to blessednesse, Psal. 119, 1. and 112, 1. If the keeping of the law be so beautifull and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall, iudge how behouefull it is to imbrace loue, which inables vs to keepe the law heere in some measure, and in heauen perfectly. As <hi>Paul</hi> saith of loue, if wee had all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, without it they were nothing; so may I say, if we could keepe all the commandements, and not do them in loue, it were nothing. Wherefore let all men that haue their hearts endued with loue, thinke they haue a great bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, and thanke God for it: and as the Apostles prayed, <hi>Lord increase our faith,</hi> so let euery good Christian pray Lord encrease my loue; for the more we loue, the more we fulfill the law; and the more we fulfill the law, the more we resemble God the giuer of the lawe; and the liker wee are to God in holinesse, the more we are to be like him in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse.

Secondly, by the measure or maner ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our loue, that we loue our neighbor as our selus, that is, as constantly without fainting, as sincere with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dissembling, being as carefull through loue to bee helpfull to the bodies and soules of others and to euerie thing that is deere vnto them, as we would haue it done to our selues.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, by the quality and nature of loue, which stirs vs vp to respect one man as well as another (though not so much) so to tender him in one thing as well as in another: for what God ioynes, no man may separate, &amp; that God which commaunded loue to our Neighbours persons, hath enioyned charity towardes all the things of our neighbors, not to hurt him in any of them, no not so much as by a thought, much lesse by disgrace or cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, or vncleannesse, or oppression, or slander. For if we do keepe that Law of not stealing, and dooing wrong, and breake the other which forbids adultery or inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, or keepe this, and trespasse by false witnesse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of lies, and euill reporters, or false accusers of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: or vntouched in all these, yet be cruell, vnmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and fierce, offending against that Lawe which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits murthers: or at a word, caring somewhat to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue one, and being loose and licentious in transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="1111" facs="tcp:20835:553"/>
of some other, not dooing many euils against our neighbors, yet stiffely and obstinately culpable in some one or few; certainly, our loue is not that christian god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loue which looketh to euery precept, and preuenteth the euill and harme of our Brethren in euery thing, as much as lyeth in vs: for loue dooth none euill vnto our neighbor. Touching these singular and particular Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, note, that that of honouring Parents is omitted, because they might be contained vnder powers also, in an other Commandement: the Commandement of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie, is prefixed vnto the Commandement of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, this of fulfilling the Lawe by loue, is ill wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted of Papists to proue Iustification by workes: for this is not heere the Apostles purpose: and when they shall proue that any meere man hath perfect charity, such as the Law exacteth, we will then confesse, that righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse before God may come by loue. Meane while, wee dare not crosse the doctrine of the Spirit, teaching in so many plaine texts, righteousnesse to be attained by faith without the workes of the Lawe, which yet wee may in some sense bee saide to fulfill; both because in our head it is perfectly kept, &amp; that is allowed to such as beleeue in him.

                     <p>For the Contents, this Scripture hath in it an
<pb n="1112" facs="tcp:20835:554"/>
exhortation vnto an holye conuersation generally, and more particularly vnto some speciall vertues of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, as temperance, sobriety, chastity, peace, with an expresse graue dehortation from the contrary vices, as excesse, ryot, wantonnesse, strife; things common, yet verie odious sinnes: all vrged and pressed from an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the circumstance of time, and the present condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christians, who being graciously thorough the Gospell deliuered from the night of ignorance and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleefe and restored to the light of knowledge &amp; faith, ought diligently to flye the workes of darknesse, and to do the deeds of light, agreeing vnto the state of Grace wherein they are set. For the connexion or dependance vpon the former Scripture, that is touched in the verie first words [<hi>And that,</hi>] as if hee should say, Vnto the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer exhortation to Christian charitie, I do further adde this concerning an holy, sober, and chast life. Heere is therefore not a continuation of the former matter (as some doe thinke the dutie of mutuall loue, to bee now prest with new reasons:) but a transition rather, from a perswasion to charity, to an exhortation to sobriety and chastity.</p>
                     <p>The like exhortation vnto this, we finde in Ephes. 5. 8. and 1 Thess. 4, 5, 6. Wherein we haue a verie plain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of this our present text, interpreting both what is the armour of light, and the workes of darknesse, and what is meant by the day and by the night, and what by sleeping, and what by waking. All these places concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the same scope and drift, which is, to raise vppe Christians from the sleepe of sinne, and carnall securitie vnto Christian watch fulnesse and sobriety.</p>

                     <p>For the Method, the text hath a proposition, which is, that we awake out of sleepe; vnto which there is ioyned a confirmation taken from sundry arguments, wherof the first is from the opportunity or circumstance
<pb n="1113" facs="tcp:20835:554"/>
of time, which beares a great sway in all things, [<hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time.</hi>] The second, is from that which is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (to wit,) the nearer we come to the goale, to runne more chearfully, that wee may obtaine the prize, [<hi>Our Saluation is neerer.</hi>] The third, from their present state, being past from the night of ignoraunce, to the day of knowledge; and therefore, the deedes of the night are to be let passe, that the deedes of the day may bee done, verse 12. The fourth, is from that which is comely and honest, verse 13. a strong motiue vnto all honest minds, and ingenuous dispositions, which are more ledde with honesty, then with vtility. This is amplified with an enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration of the contrary works of darknesse, as ryoting, drunkennesse, &amp;c. which are directly repugnant to the armour of light, which is not heere particularly recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vp, but wrapt in a new Metaphor of a garment [<hi>Put on Christ:</hi>] which comprehendeth the graces of Christ, opposite to the former workes of darknesse. All is shut vp with an answere to a secret obiection: What then, shall we allow no delight to our flesh and fraile nature? Yes (saith the Apostle) so it be not filthy lust, &amp; to serue lasciuiousnesse, verse 14.</p>

By [<hi>Knowing</hi>] is meant so to see it as to obserue and marke it, and so with such earnest endeauour to looke to it, as not to let it flye and passe away. Knowledge is vsed for all such things as doe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low knowledge, loue, care, consideration, labor, &amp;c. so is the word vsed, Psal. 1. last verse, Rom. 11 2.

                     <p>Hence ariseth a generall instruction, that all our actions are to be done seasonably in a due time. As for example, to vse the instances of the Apostle, if wee will sleepe to do it in the night, for that is the season fit for
<pb n="1114" facs="tcp:20835:555"/>
sleepe; but if we will awake and worke, let vs do that in the day, as nature hath ordained as meete for such a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, as it is written Psal. 104. <hi>The Sun ariseth, and man goeth forth vnto his labour.</hi> There are sundry things which being done in their season, are well done, and praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, but being done out of meet time they are faults and blame-worthy.</p>
                     <p>Instinct of Nature hath taught the Swallow &amp; Crane to know and keepe their seasons, as the Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> saith, Iere. 8, 7. and it is the counsell of the Heathens to take hold of occasions and seasons. The Poets did feigne Time to haue a bush before, &amp; to be bald behind, wherby they meane to teach, that opportunities and fit times to do things is not to be ouerslipped. Christ hath giuen vs an example in his owne person, for hee duely obserued occasions of Doctrine and Myracles. This wisedome our Apostle would teach vs heere, when he saith, [<hi>It is high time.</hi>] And vnto the same discretion, doth <hi>Iames</hi> call vs, Iames 5, 13. <hi>To pray when wee are afflicted, to sing Psalmes when we reioyce. Esay</hi> complaines of such as gaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to pleasure and mirth, when Gods iudgments cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them to mourning. It is great indiscretion securelie to follow our carnall pleasures, when God cals vs to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious repentance. <hi>Salomon</hi> saith of God himselfe, Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cl. 3, 1. <hi>That GOD hath an appointed time</hi> (that, is a sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) <hi>for all his Workes.</hi> Let Gods Children labour to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their fathers wisedome, for that which is written of speeches &amp; words spoken in season, they are like Apples of Golde, with Pictures of Siluer, may be said of works done in season, they are precious and pleasant. It were a shame for vs to be worse then sencelesse creatures, and godlesse Heathen, yet it is the common sinne of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as in their particular actions, not to marke offered occasions of God to do good: so in their general course of life, numbers are asleepe when they should wake, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Apostles counsell heere, <hi>It is high time that ye did awake out of sleepe.</hi>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>[<hi>Sleepe</hi>] by a metaphor signifies sinne; it is a speech<note place="margin">Sleepe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.</note> translated from the body to the mind, for (sleepe) proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is a natural thing belonging to the body: it is occasioned<note place="margin">A natural and a spirituall waking.</note> by euaporations of nourishment, whence fumes rising out of the stomacke into the head, thereby the senses beeing bound, a man is vnable to heare, or see, or smell, or to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the common functions of naturall life. A waking out of sleepe is the liberty of the senses, that they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme their functions, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> describes it in his booke (<hi>de somno &amp; vigilys.</hi>) Spiritually by sleepe is signified [sin] which being securely liued in, disableth the soule from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the duties of a godly life, whereof men haue no care so long as they bee carelesse and sencelesse, without the knowledge and feare of God, no more then sleepy men haue care of their ordinary affaires. Further, our spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all waking implyeth a knowledge of the will of God, and a study of a godly conuersation: at a word slothfulnesse of the minde drowned in worldly cares, carnall security, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and contempt of God, are the sleepe heere spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, which causeth vnregenerate men to be dead, euen while they are aliue, as it is written of the <hi>Ephesians</hi> being vnbeleeuers, Ephes. 2, 1. and of those wanton widdowes which were giuen to their pleasure, 1. Tim. 5. and of the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> both Pastor and people, Reuel. 3, 1. For as for the time of [sleepe] it litle differeth from death: so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure sinners are spiritually dead; but on the contrary, faith in Christ, accompanied with hope, loue, feare of God, and repentance, is the waking out of sleepe heere spoken of, which causeth men though dead to liue; for such as liue godly in this world, are sure to liue happily in the world to come, for the lise of gtace is eternall ending in glorye which neuer hath an end.</p>

                     <p>Yea, but these Romanes were conuerted and did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, therefore why doth he say to them, It is time to awake out of sleepe? as if they were dead vnto sinne, and not aliue to God?</p>

                     <p>It is true, that the Romanes for the most or best
<pb n="1116" facs="tcp:20835:556"/>
part, were indeed regenerate persons and beleeuers, such as were already wakened out of the sleepe of sinne, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the testimony that <hi>Paul</hi> gaue them. Rom. 1, 6, 7, 8. and 6, 17, 19. yet this admonition is not vnfit and vnmeete for them, because still there were amongst them such as slept in sinne, being drowned in the pleasures of this life, not minding God nor their owne saluation: and euen the faithfull themselues were but in part awaked out of sinne, Math. 25, 1, 2. The fiue wise Virgins slumbred no lesse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the foolish, &amp; the Church Cant. 5, 2. confesseth that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer her heart waked, yet shee was asleepe. Thirdly, Christians haue still some drowsinesse and sluggishnesse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout heauenly things hanging vpon them: this exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then (to awake out of sleepe) is alwayes needsull, as to leaue the reprobate without excuse, and to leade the elect which are not yet borne anew, to a consideration of their estate, that they may turne and liue: so to quicken the soules of true beleeuers, vnto a farre greater care of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse then euer yet they exprest. And this is the very les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son which we are all heere to learne and take out, that such as haue done well goe forwards with all alacrity and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. It is not enough to enter into the estate of christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but we must still goe forwards till we haue finished our course. Christians must seeke to grow in grace, as world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings in riches, in honours, &amp;c. a progresse in true piety is the scope which <hi>Paul</hi> heere aimeth at.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>The very same that <hi>Paul</hi> rendreth heere, because our saluation (that is, eternall life in heauen,) is neerer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when we beleeued, which compareth (not the law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> with the Gospell,) as an obscure light with a more cleerer, but the increasing of our faith with the beginning, (for he writeth not to Iewes onely, but to Gentiles,) by an allusion to such as runne in a race, who runne the more swifter the neerer they come to their races end; least if they be slothfull, others ouerstrip them and get the goale from them: So Christians the longer time they haue beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers,
<pb n="1017" facs="tcp:20835:556"/>
and the further they haue proceeded in the way of godlinesse, they must runne with the greater diligence and earnestnesse. The motion of a Christian life must not be like to a violent motion, which is slower towards the end: but like to a naturall motion, which towards the ende is the swifter. Hitherto belong all those promises, Math. 10. He shall bee saued which continueth to the end: and the threatning of being shut out of the kingdome, if we looke back after we haue set our hand to the plough, Luke 9, 62. and those reprofes, Will ye end in the flesh after yee haue begun in the Spirite? Galath. 3, 3. and those exhortations, Remember <hi>Lots</hi> wife: againe, So runne as ye may obtaine, 1. Cor. 9, 24. and, Keepe faith and a good conscience, 1. Tim. 1, 19. and, Striue lawfully, and lay hold on eternall life; and whatsoeuer places doe perswade vs to increase more and more, and to grow, and to holde fast what wee haue receiued, and to continue in the bountifulnesse of God. He that is a watchman may not wake one halfe of the day and sleepe the other, so he may loose his head; nor a ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner in a race may giue ouer afore he come to the goale, then he loseth the garland, and such as faint in wrastling loose the crowne; therefore quicken your hearts, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage your selues to profite and proceed in your godly course, whereof a great part being already runne, &amp; there being perill by slacking and giuing ouer study of piety, and such fruite and benefit in perseuerance, it behoueth you so much the more cheerefully to finish the rest of the race, knowing there will bee an ende, and your hope with your labour in the Lord will not be in vaine.</p>

                     <p>Heere is the thirde argument, taken from the circumstance of time, or of the Romanes present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, concluded in these two Sillogismes: First, when
<pb n="1118" facs="tcp:20835:557"/>
the night is gone, the workes of the night must be laide aside; but when we beleeue, the night is gone: therfore we are to cease the workes of darknesse. Secondly, when the day is come, we are to do the workes of the day, but the day doth shine vppon vs; therefore we are to do the workes of the day.</p>
                     <p>The summe of the whole Argument is, that seeing the night of ignorance is past (which is the season of liuing in sinne and security) and the day of the knowledge of God is appeared (which is the season to awake in,) let vs therefore endeauour to frame our liues sutable vnto the time and present state of grace wherein wee are placed, by putting on the armour of light, and casting off the workes of darknesse.</p>

                     <p>Night properly is the time which followes the setting of the Sun, when darknesse couers the earth, and men giue themselues to sleepe and rest: but heere Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorically it signifies that time of ignorance and vnbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, which goeth before our effectuall calling. And (by being farre spent) is meant not beeing quite past ouer, for then it should not be saide, the day is at hand (for it should be present:) but the word signifies, that it is well gone forward and proceeded in, and neare spent, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the day (as one would speake.) Thus the Greeke word imports, according to which, it is transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Latines, not <hi>Praererist,</hi> but <hi>processit nox.</hi>

                     <p>These two: the first is, that euen the elect of God before their new birth, are couerd with the night, and oppressed with the darkenesse of infidelity and sin. They do no more see the way to eternall life, then men in the darke see the way to walke in: they grope euen at no one day, euen like the <hi>Sandom tes</hi> at <hi>Lots</hi> doore. So they doe not see what they are to doe that they may please
<pb n="1119" facs="tcp:20835:557"/>
God, as they in Actes 2. For they which are in darknes, know not whither they go. In this respect, being like the man borne blinde, Iohn 9. whose eyes Christ must open before he can see: so must he enlighten our mindes before wee can haue sounde and sauing knowledge of God.</p>
                     <p>The reason is rendred, 1 Cor. 2, 14. This miserable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state of the chosen before faith is called darknesse, Ephe. 5, 8. and the power of darknesse, Actes 26, 26. and night in this text: and themselues abiding in this estate, are called children of the night and darknesse, 1 Thess. 5, 7. Therefore as <hi>Paul</hi> being blind, must haue the scales ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from his eyes, that he may see, so the elect can haue no knowledge of God vnto saluation, till they are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by him from their naturall ignorance, which is the first worke of grace in them, called illumination of the Spirit; who beginneth the conuersion of the elect at the enlightning of their vnderstanding, Rom. 12, 2.</p>

If wee cannot perceiue the things of God, much lesse are wee able to embrace and follow them, for <hi>Voluntas sequitur intellectum.</hi> Secondly, it must moue the chosen which are called &amp; enlightned both to ioyful thankfulnesse, that they haue escaped the night of ignorance, and are become children of the day, saying, I praise the Lord, who hath turnd my night into day; And vnto harty sorrow in behalfe of such as do yet sticke in their grosse darknesse of sinne and ignoraunce, pittying them, and not vpbraiding them; remembring our selues that we were once such as they be Galat. 6, 1.

                     <p>That they which are regenerate, are not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly freed from ignorance and vnbeleefe, whereof stil they haue the remainders, though they reigne not nowe as before their calling. <hi>Pauls</hi> confession touching himselfe, Phil. 3, 12. and touching all the Saintes, 1 Cor. 9, 25, &amp;c. sufficiently teach, that there are imperfections still stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our knowledge. If in his, how much more in ours so farre inferiour to him? As it is in the twilight, so it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with the godly in this life, much darknesse mixed with their light. Hence it is, that in the next wordes he writeth not, that the day, (that is,) the knowledge of Christ by the Gospell is present and come, but approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and at hand onely. It shineth not forth fully, but is in part light, some in part darke: as at the dawning or breake of day, so is it with the godly in this life, they are somewhat illuminared, but not wholly enlightned. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede their knowledge now after their new birth, being compared with their ignorance before, may be tearmed day, but it is not so; rather like a night, in respect of that knowledge they shall haue in heauen, for then they shal see him as he is, 1 Cor. 13, 10, 12. Distinguish these three times: First, night before our calling: secondly, day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter effectuall vocation: thirdly, full day at our glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>

                     <p>That we maruel not when we see some learned godly men ouertaken with some errors, yea and whole Churches also, as the Galathians erred about iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Corinthians about the resurrection from the dead. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> was tainted with an opinion of free will, and <hi>Peters</hi> primacy: <hi>Origen</hi> maintained vniuersall saluation of men and diuels: <hi>Cyprian</hi> held rebaptization: <hi>Augustine</hi> wrote doubtfully about purgatory, and helde (for a while) confidently, that Children could not be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued without the Lords Supper: <hi>Illyricus</hi> failed about O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall sinne: <hi>Hierom</hi> immoderately extolled virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

aboue marriage: <hi>Ensebius</hi> was an Arrian, also defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Peters</hi> abiuring his Lord: <hi>Luther</hi> held consubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. At a word, as the fairest face hath a wart, so the learnedst men haue their errours, because the night of their ignorance was not whollye spent, nor the day of their knowledge wholly come, their remaining igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance brought false expositions and opinions. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let this warne and exhort al Christians more earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to pray God to keepe them from errours, &amp; to that end, that he would encrease their knowledge and iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Col. 1, 9, 10. 11.</p>
                     <p>Also, let it admonish vs neuer to content our selues with any measure of vnderstanding in heauenly thinges, but vse all good means, that we may grow more &amp; more in all knowledge of Christ, ioyning knowledge vnto knowledge, as worldly men adde riches to riches, and as the Sunne encreaseth in brightnesse till high noon, so let the word of Christ dwell in vs in all wisedome. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, let it moue vs both to be modest in our assertions about diuine things: not hardy and bold to affirme that whereof we doubt, but suspecting our owne ignorance, be more ready to heare then to speake, to learne then to teach: and the things to be knowne many (&amp; deep some of them) being humbled, that our ignorance is so much, and our knowledge so little, duely considering, that as wee haue no knowledge but what wee receiue, so that which we do know, is farre lesse then that which we do not knowe; which all holy men haue both felt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed.</p>
                     <p>Note further, that howe much the day is aboue the night, so much doth knowledge excell ignorance, Eccl. 2, 13. Also the necessity of knowledge appeareth by this metaphor: the day not more needefull to doe worldlie works, then knowledge to a Christian, to do the works of saluation. This condemnes such of extreame follie, as care not for knowledge, but do despise vnderstanding: and serues as a spurre to quicken our mindes vnto the
<pb n="1122" facs="tcp:20835:559"/>

                     <p>By walking (after the ordinary phrase) is meant liuing or leading our course of life.

                     <p>They be 2. First fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the word [walke] we learne that Christianity is no idle profession. As men of this worlde when they bee rising in a morning out of their beds, must addresse themselues to some labour: thus God, nature, reason, lawes, and religion doe teach that none may liue out of a vocation, or idle in his vocation. Bees, Birds, and Beasts doe worke: should men liue at ease? So Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren when they once know Christ, and that the day light of knowledge doth shine, they must euer after be dooing, to knowledge they must ioyne action, vnto talking adde walking. As sparkles flye vpwards, so men be borne to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and so the elect which be borne againe, they are to worke the workes of God: see Iohn 6, 27, 28. Luke 13, 24. 2. Pet. 1, 6. The Church of God is like a Vineyard, Mat. 20, 1, 2. also to husbandry, 1. Cor. 3 9. and a Christians life is likened to a warfare, Christians be souldiors. These be painefull trades, and courses of life full of labour, which shewes that in Christianity there is no place for sluggish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and security.</p>
                     <p>Also Christians be a brood of trauellers, their country is aboue, the way it is long &amp; narrow, therfore that they may come to their iournies end, there is no standing stil or sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe, but there must be a walking and a going on. Marke that <hi>Paul</hi> puts himselfe in the number, (<hi>Let vs walke:</hi>) an Apostle may not liue at ease in Gods Church. Christ himselfe went and walked about, doing good: <hi>My Father workes hitherto</hi> saith Christ, Iohn 5, 17. <hi>and I worke: the Spirite also worketh;</hi> is it meete that wee bee exempted from walking and working?</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, to informe our iudgement about the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition<note place="margin">Vse.</note> of our christian calling, that it is coupled with much difficulty, contention, and labour, contray to that which most thinke, that to be a Christian is a matter of nothing, but to say the Lords prayer, the ten Commandements and Creede, to come to Church Sundaies and Holy-daies, &amp;c.
<pb n="1125" facs="tcp:20835:560"/>
These are deceiued, for we are taught that our profession is full of perill, (wee must forsake our goods and liues for Christ,) and of paine, and trauaile. The virgins which will enter in with the Bride-groome, must bee watchfull, and they shall be blessed who walke in the wayes of Gods commandements.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it serues to reproue such as sleepe still in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and carelesse liuing, yet beare themselues in hand they be good Christians; they will spare no paines for back and belly, for profite and pleasure, but will not lift a foote nor stirre a finger towards the worke of their saluation: let such remember that the fiue foolish Virgins were shut out for this cause, for that they were negligent to trimme their Lamps. If that these slothfull Christians will not bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by that voice of Christ, Mat. 20, 6. <hi>Why stand yee heere idle all the day?</hi> nor by that of <hi>Salomon, He that loueth sleepe shall surely goe in rags, and come to pouery:</hi> yet let them be affraide of being shut out of the kingdome, and cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to extreame darkenesse, which must bee the portion of all such as loue their ease, and snort in their sinnes: For such as liue like droanes deuouring the hony gathered by the industrious Bees, what will be their ends?</p>

                     <p>That our workes must be honest, and such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the day of knowledge. Common ciuility teacheth men to goe decently, and to doe honest things in the day when al men see and obserue how they goe and what they doe: Likewise let Christians thinke that now the day-light of the Gospell is come, they must doe onely such workes as may become the Gospell, and are worthy of the light. <hi>Men are drunke in the night,</hi> saith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. <hi>Thess.</hi> 5, 7. <hi>and when ye knew not God, ye serued dumbe Idols, Gal.</hi> 4, 8. And he tels the Ephesians that when they were in ignorance they committed sinne with greedinesse, Ephes. 4, 19. but now that they know Christ, they must no more haue fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with the workes of the night, the vnfruitefull workes of darkenesse: For the light which hath appeared
<pb n="1126" facs="tcp:20835:561"/>
teacheth vs to deny vngodlines &amp; worldly lusts, and to liue godly towards God, iustly towards our neighbour, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly in our selues. If a man would doe such workes in the day as many will doe in the night, what a shame were that? so it were a dishonesty now that Christ the day starre is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen, still to lye, steale, deceiue, &amp;c. and do the other works of darkenesse. As <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts, Ephes. 4, 28. and 1. Peter 4, 2, 3, 4. so I exhort you not to doe the euill now which in your ignorance ye were wont to doe, but to thinke it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, that so long ye haue followed the lusts of ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, henceforth applying your selues to please God by doing godly workes. Now seeing there must be a ceasing from euill workes that wee may doe the workes beseeming the day: what may wee thinke of such as since the day appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, continue still in their former vices, their vncleannesse, vsury, couetousnesse, oppression, cruelty, railing, slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, swearing, to whom may we compare these? They are like vnto certaine infamous and vnthrifty gamesters, who contrary to the order God hath set in nature, turne night into day, and day into night, sporting and playing al night time when they should sleepe, and sleeping in the day whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they should worke: So it sareth with numbers of vs who still delight in, and exercise our selues in workes of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, nowe in the cleare and bright day of grace: these things which without red cheekes one cannot doe, no not in secret, &amp; which a Christian should be ashamed to speake of, yet are commonly practised without blussing, in this broad day light of knowledge: a most lamentable case, &amp; will cost full deare to walke still in darkenesse now in the day of the Gospell.</p>

                     <p>These sixe especially: First gluttony, or rioting, which properly signifies night reuellings, all vntimely and vnmeasurable eating, and more generally it imports all excessiue feasts by day or night, when men eate till they
<pb n="1127" facs="tcp:20835:561"/>
glut themselues to the dulling of their spirits, the silling of their bodies with diseases, the wasting of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, the stirring vp of Concupiscence. And note, that <hi>Paul</hi> forbids not eating, whereof there is great necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or feasting, whereof there is lawfull vse, so the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion be iust, and care be had of fit time, of our estate, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and ability; also that moderation be vsed: but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate, vnhonest feasting is heere prohibited, such as the Heathens vsed, and the Prophets condemne, Amos 6, 3, 4, 5. Esay 5, 12, and 22, 12. The second vice is drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennesse, this is excesse in drinking, taxed by Esay, 5, 11. Prou. 23, 29, 30, &amp;c. it causeth much woe to bodye and minde. <hi>For wine &amp; women takes away a mans hart,</hi> (or wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,) Hos. 4, 11. &amp; by <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet 4, 3. Eph. 5, 11, 12. in wine is excesse, otherwise a little wine for infirmity sake is allowed, 1 Tim. 5, 23. It is reckoned vp among the sins which barre men out of Gods kingdome Gal. 5, 17, 18. and 1 Cor. 9, 10. This vice being so sweete and agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to our corrupt nature, is hardly repented of. Lawes of God &amp; men wil not bridle it. Such as suffer it, when it is in their power to hinder, or do not what lieth in them to hinder it: they are no lesse guilty before GOD, then they that committed it.</p>
                     <p>The third vice is Chambering, the sourth is wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that is, all vncleannesse about the acte of genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or bed meeting by fornication, adultery, &amp;c. <hi>Non prohibet cum mulieribus miscere sed scortari</hi> (saith <hi>Chryso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome</hi>) these be continuall companions and fruits of the two former. For vagrant and vnchast desires about sexe, do proceede from excesse in meats and drinks. This may appeare by the example of <hi>Lot, Noab, Dauid,</hi> all which vpon much drinking and full stomackes did sinne by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continency, <hi>Sine Cerere &amp; Baccho friget Venus.</hi> Looking vpon wine, and lust after women, are ioyned together by <hi>Salomon,</hi> Pro. 23, 33. Rioting and harlotry met in the prodigall son: and who sees not most Bastardes, where there is most liberall drinking and feeding?</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="1128" facs="tcp:20835:562"/>The fift vice is strife, which is a falling out and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding about matters of Faith or affaires of life. The sixte vice is enuy, which is a repining or griefe at the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of others. See the Dial. on Rom. 1. verse 29.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>These sixe things: First, they be such vices, as a man which hath no further care but of his honest repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation he wil not do them, many Heathens haue shunned them, and haue bin free from them touching outwarde acte. Secondly, obserue that he nameth some few vices in stead of all: see more of this bad broode, in Gal. 5, 19. 1 Cor. 6, 9, 10. Thirdly, these were named because they were nationall, or more naturall, or sinnes most vsed, therefore most to be striuen against. Fourthly, a great fountaine or sinke rather of sinne is stopt and dammed vp, when either christians do repent of excesse in eating and drinking, or when gouernors doe represse these vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; whereas by sufferance and practise of them, a floud gate of iniquity is set wide open. Fiftly, obserue that godly persons after their newe birth be subiect to these dishonest sinnes, else <hi>Paul</hi> would not haue dehorted the beleeuing <hi>Romanes</hi> from them. Therefore Gods people must watch and pray, and his Ministers must warne the people continually of them. Lastly, to be free from these vices, is required, that Christians auoide all occasions, means, causes, &amp; prouocations vnto them. Sinne cannot be eschewed, whiles enticements vnto sinne be cherri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed: Who will no euill doe, must do nothing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs thereto.</p>

                     <p>The maine exhortation is repeated, onelie the forme of words is varied. Also now he expoundes the armour of light (as hee had by particulars declared the workes of darknesse) by a new Metaphor of a Garment,<note place="margin">How &amp; why Christ a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> to which Christ is likened [<hi>put on,</hi>] because as a Garment hides our corporall nakednesse, so by Christ our sinnes

are couered from the sight of Gods Iustice. Also a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, compasseth in our body aboue and belowe, from top to toe, so all the corruptions of beleeuing sinners, bee couered vnder this Mantle of Christes righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, a Garment serues not for couering onely, but for comelinesse &amp; ornament too; so the Spirit of Christ dooth decke and adorne Christians soules, euen as his death doth hide our spirituall pollutions: Christ is our wedding Garment, and our long white robe, Reuel. 3, 18. <hi>Aarons</hi> Garment is a type heereof, the glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell, of the High-Priest vnder the Law; was a figure of this spirituall raymenr, and taught Gods people, that as neuer the High Priest might appear before God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Ephod and fine linnen garment, so sinners can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with liking and allowance come vnto God other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then by Christ, by whome alone there is accesse made to God, Rom. 5, 2. <hi>Iacob</hi> put on <hi>Esaus</hi> clothes when he got the blessing, and for the obtaining of heauenlie blessednesse, it is verie necessarie that we put on Christ.</p>

                     <p>Christ is put on two wayes: First, <hi>Sacramento tenus.</hi> Secondly, <hi>reipsa:</hi> either in the Sacrament onely, or in truth also. Thus the Maister of Sentences distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth out of <hi>Augustine,</hi> who writeth thus, <hi>Indu mus Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum aut ad Secraments perceptionem, aut ad vite sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationem.</hi> The former is common to good and bad; the latter is peculiar to the Saints: many of Gods Children do liue euen in the estate of sin and death without Christ till they come to yeares of discretion, as <hi>Zacheus, Paule,</hi> the theefe; these till their conuersion receiue no more but the Sacrament without Christ, who is the thing sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified; and reprobates do neuer put on Christ otherwise then Sacramentally, and by profession of him before the Church. <hi>Paul</hi> writing heere to persons both baptized
<pb n="1130" facs="tcp:20835:563"/>
and conuerted, and growne into yeares, and grafted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ, exhorteth them vnto the latter putting on of Christ, to wit, in deede and trueth, and that more and more vnto further sanctification of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

First, when the elect tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough a liuely faith, do as certainely possesse Christ, as they do their owne Garments; whereof they are still the more assured, the more they stirre vp their Faith, and do encrease in good knowledge of the Gospell. Vnto this putting on, belongs two actions, one of Christ, that hee put on all our sinnes and wretchednesse, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Cor. 5, 21. the other of the beleeuing heart, to lay holde more firmelie on Christ his righteousnesse and life, to make them our owne as our cloathes be.</p>
                     <p>The second way of putting on Christ truly, is when the fruits and graces of the Spirit, are plentifully giuen, or more largely powred into the Christian soule, to deck &amp; beautifie her as a rich Garment: there being two vses of apparrell, first to couer, and secondly to adorne: this latter, is heere respected principally at least. For howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer <hi>Paul</hi> would haue Christians to bee cloathed with the Sacrifice of Christs death, as <hi>Adam</hi> couered his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked body with skinnes of dead Beastes, yet because hee doth not heere entreate of incorporation into Christ, &amp; apprehending him to Iustification, and this phrase of putting on Christ, beeing opposed vnto the workes of darkenesse, mentioned verse 13. Therefore this woulde be vnderstood chiefely of growing and encreasing daily in the graces of the new man, such as be rehearsed, Col. 3, 10. Galath. 5, 22. 2 Peter 1, 5, 6. but especially in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, chastity, charity, peace, and meekenesse, which are contrary vnto these vices mentioned in the former verse. So then, the meaning is, that as the bodie with Iewels and outward Ornaments, so our Christian soules should bee beautified plentifully with such temperance,
<pb n="1131" facs="tcp:20835:563"/>
tinency, sober and chaste liuing, purity of thought and bodye, with that loue and comfort as commeth vnto vs from Christ, and were in all abundance in the manhood of Christ, whom the Scripture setteth before vs as a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne and sampler, to follow in these and other graces, Iohn 10, 27. 2 Pet. 2, 21. 1 Iohn 2, 6.</p>

                     <p>That all Christians that doe endeauour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues more to resemble Christ in these good workes, then they haue done before, beeing more studious of a temperate, peaceable, humble, and chaste behauiour, they do fulfill this precept of putting on Christ. Againe, whereas these graces are called [Christ,] wee are taught that we must haue Christ himselfe, before wee can haue any gift of grace. Whereas <hi>Origen</hi> saith <hi>He that hath all graces, hath Christ,</hi> it were better to say with <hi>Chrysostom, He that hath Christ, can lack no Vertues:</hi> for the treasure of all graces are in Christ, and himselfe is giuen ere his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesits and graces can be gotten.</p>
                     <p>Also where Christ is, there is the Spirite of Christ, which is a Spirit of knowledge, of the feare of God, of chastity and righteousnesse, &amp;c. Moreouer, heere wee are to be admonished, that as our apparrell is seene, and makes vs knowne to them with whom we liue: so Christ must appeare in all our words and workes. Wee are to liue as Christ liued, that we may be knowne whose wee are.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, as they which put on their apparel, put on one part as well as another, &amp; with delight; so Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians must chearefully imitate Christ in all his vertues, so farre as concerneth them: and this they ought to do, not for a day or two, or a few months, or a year, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, all the time of their pilgrimage, striuing how to abound in the workes of the Spirit. For as wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not haue worldly riches all at once, so neyther may wee looke to enioy all good giftes in a moment, or in a short time, for wee are full of imperfections, and haue manie
<pb n="1132" facs="tcp:20835:564"/>
temptations and hinderances to wrestle with: therefore our whole life must bee nothing but a profiting and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing in spirituall and Christian graces, a putting on of Christ.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, this exhortation being vniuersall, directed to all members of the Church, therefore Magistrates, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, people, olde, young, learned, vnlearned, men, women, must make it their study to followe and imitate Christ, being daily more like him in all parts of honesty and holinesse. For certaine it is, that they neuer put on Christ vnto Iustification, who labour not for the graces of Sanctification. He hath not Christs death to forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, who doth not tread in the steps of Christ his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and obedience.</p>

                     <p>Whereas such beleeuers as know their libertie in things indifferent through the Gospell preached, did despise and deride others which yet sawe not the aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of the Leuiticall and Legall rites, wee learne, that knowledge separated from loue is daungerous. For by our owne corruption and fraile nature, spirituall pride will creepe in (if we do not looke well to it) and make vs set light, and account as nothing, all who thinke not as we do. 1 Cor. 8, 1. <hi>Knowledge puffeth vp.</hi> As in earthly things, such as haue a faculty or any cunning, are apt to be lifted vp by it, and to scorne others which haue not the like: so it is in spirituall respectes, commonly such as see more then others, disdaine others in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of themselues, which ought not to be so, because all wee haue, is borrowed, and it is none of ours: As if a Stage player should bee proude for his hyred attire. Also, if wee excell others in some things, others may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel vs in better things, and we may al confesse (with <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>) In holy Scriptures there be (saith he) more things which I know not, then they be which I do know. Again learne moreouer, that ignoraunce makes men rash to iudge and condemne others. Ignorant persons cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure others verie headily which doe differ from them,
<pb n="1139" facs="tcp:20835:567"/>
and doe condemne euery thing they cannot reach vnto. As heere the Iewes weake in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Let this kindle in vs a great detestation of ignoraunce, not onely because it is a part of the diuels Image, a prop of his kingdome, a transgression of the first Commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, requiring the knowledge of the true God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which we cannot loue or feare, or trust in him. Also it is a darkenesse of the mind, leading vs to the darknesse of hell, being the roote and mother of errour and manie sinnes; for the blinde eates many a flye, as it is written, <hi>Ye do erre because ye know not the Scriptures,</hi> Math. 22, 29. But euen for this cause let vs so much the more hate it, for that it makes vs hasty in condemning, vncharitable in iudging, and precipitant in our censures touching men and matters, which is an iniquitie very seuerely taxed and threatned by our Sauiour Christ, Math. 7, 1, 2. Finally, seeing of contention there comes such euil fruits as mutuall contempt, and harde censures, let vs beware how we entertaine any occasion of strife, especiallie in causes of Faith and Religion. For whereas all contention is like worme-wood, euen a bitter thing, and bringeth foorth bitter fruites, yet diuision in matters of doctrine is most violent and sharpe. Therefore, Ere the strise bee medled withall, it is good to cease and leaue off, as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in his Prouerbes counselleth vppon this reason, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause none knoweth what wil be the end of it. This may not be forgotten, that for indifferent things the knot of Brother-hood, is not to bee dissolued, nor communion forsaken; yea although some bee so transported with a strong affection to them, as to holde them necessarie. As these weak Iewes (which beleeued in Christ) did esteem of difference in meates and dayes, that a conscience was to be still made of them; and that without contempt of <hi>Moses,</hi> and sinne against God the Lawgiuer, they could

                     <p>Receiuing, signifies the taking and adopting some to be his people, which were not his people. By [<hi>Him</hi>] is meant the Gentiles, who beeing enemies and strangers from God, and Infidels and seruers of idolles: by the loue and fauour of God, were taken into the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of the Church, to be members of Christ thorough faith. Albeit these wordes do belong also vnto the Iew, weake in faith, for euen <hi>Him</hi> also hath God graciously adopted in Christ; yet the word (iudging) which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately goes before, and followes after, shewes it dooth more fitly belong to the beleeuing Gentile, by the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell brought neere, and receyued to bee a people; for it was the Iewes fault to iudge the Gentile, as they despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Iews. The sum of the Apostles reason is this: See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="1141" facs="tcp:20835:568"/>
God hath so dearely loued the Gentiles, as to make them his people, therefore the weake Iewes were too blame to condemne them, for vsing their Christian li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in meates and dayes.</p>

                     <p>What doctrine are we to gather from these words?</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That all beleeuing people (bee they Iewes or Gentiles) are deare vnto God. The reason heereof is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are his children by grace, and the members of his Sonne, hauing their sins forgiuen them, and his image imprinted in them, being heyrs of God, &amp; fellow-heyres with Christ; also beleeuers are the spouse of Christ, &amp; his flock the husbandry &amp; vineyard of God. This must cause vs to receiue and make much of those whome God hath taken into his loue. In Kings Courts, they are loued of all, which are loued of the King. When the King would honor <hi>Mordechai,</hi> euen <hi>Hamon</hi> must do him honor: so it is our part kindly to affect and entreate all them whome the King of Heauen is kinde vnto. There are no earthly Parents, but account themselues contemned or loued, by the contempt or loue of their children: so God holds himselfe respected or despised, when we respect or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise his children; for they be as deare to him as the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his eye, as the Signet vpon his right hand. As God will blesse them which blesse his people, so he will curse such as curse them. This may strike a terror into all such as hate the righteous, and exercise tyrany towards such as be Gods friends: and must serue to keepe all Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans from rash vncharitable censuring, and iudging one of another, least we be found among those who doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury vnto such as GOD hath accepted of for his owne. Lastly, it dooth instruct and informe vs all, what recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning we are to make of such as bee their euen brethren, (namely) that wee are to account of them as persons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of God into his speciall fauour. For, howsoeuer we cannot infallibly be assured, yet we are to be charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly perswaded of other Christians, that they are adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God, and receiued into his speciall fauour, if wee
<pb n="1142" facs="tcp:20835:569"/>
see but the least argument of their effectual calling. Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which grounds we must speake and thinke louinglie of them and of their actions, as far as we may do it with truth and reason, tendering all that we haue to do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, as men partakers of one nature, but much more as Christians partakers of the same grace.</p>

                     <p>It hath in it the second reason drawn from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon equity, thus: Beleeuers are seruants of God, but we may not condemne anothers seruant; therefore wee may not iudge one another in thinges indifferent. The assumption is set downe by way of interrogation, which hath the force of an affirmation. It is the Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they which be equally seruants to one Lorde, may not iudge one another (but by their Lords appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) without iniury to their Lord. No Prince wil take vpon him to punish the seruants of another Prince: and that made <hi>Dauid</hi> to be angry, when hee heard how <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nun</hi> King of <hi>Ammon</hi> had abused his Seruants, 2. Sa. 10, 1, 2, 3. &amp;c. Wee our selues would take it as a great preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice vnto vs, if any should censure or chastise our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants. Common Law of the land punisheth such as strike other mens seruants: there lyeth an action of bartery in that case. The knowledge of this equity kept <hi>Paul</hi> from retaining with him <hi>Onesimus,</hi> because hee was another mans seruant, without whose knowledge and leaue bee would not keepe him. From this naturall and Nationall Law, the Apostle heere perswades peace, inasmuch as it behooued the seruants of one and the same Lorde, with kindnesse and loue to embrace one another.</p>

                     <p>That a Christian ought not to beleeue or do (in case of Religion) any thing doubtfully or waueringly, but vpon certaine knowledge, that hee pleaseth God in that which he doth and beleeueth. The reason is, because as no person, so nothing which is not of Faith can please God, Heb. 11, 6. And it is sinne, whatsoeuer is done out of a doubtfull minde, Rom. 14, 23.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, it serues to reproue such as teach, that we ought to be doubtfull, and can haue no certainty whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we or our workes please God, but ought euer to be in suspence, hoping well as they speake. Secondly, such as boldly aduenture to speak and do such things as they be not resolued of, that they are good and true. This is a sinne contrarying this aduise of <hi>Paul:</hi> but they especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally do crosse it, which dare teach others for trueth, that which themselues be not well perswaded of: and such as content themselues to beleeue as Church-beleeuers, and know not what.</p>
                     <p>Finally, this therefore exhorts vs all to labour for more knowledge of the word, without which, no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian can haue assurance, except together with vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of the word, he do attaine iudgement to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to discerne. And if a Christian ought to haue an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance euen in things indifferent, much rather in things necessary, which be commanded or prohibited, and most of all in matters of Faith and Religion, wherein euerie one ought to be so well grounded, and so certainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, not by anothers Faith, but by his owne, as hee will be ready rather to dye, then to deny the knowne truth, as <hi>Paul,</hi> and the other Apostles and Martyrs of Christ were.</p>
                     <p>Vnto which constant resolution there is required no generall and confused, but a distinct particular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the reuealed will of God, and that in a great degree, hauing ready som sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce or place of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, well and clearly knowne and perceiued of vs, both

                     <p>Two new Reasons to perswade the beleeuing <hi>Romanes</hi> to peace, about things indifferent. First, from the end vnto which both strong and weake doe looke in their particular actions concerning indifferent things, verse 6. Secondly, from the vniuersall end of all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, both in things necessary, and of a middle Nature, (to wit) the glory of Christ, who being the soueraigne Lord of all, and that both in our life and death; therefore in our whole course his glory ought to bee the onelie marke of all our doings. Now, if God be glorified both by weake and by strong, let not one vncharitably cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure another.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Come to the Interpretation, and shew vs the meaning of the Wordes, what signifies [obseruing a day, &amp; to the Lord?]</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>To regard a day, is to keepe it holy, &amp; to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe God in it, as he appointed to bee done by <hi>Moses. [Not to obserue]</hi> is not to worship God in the day, nor to keepe it holy. [<hi>To the Lord,</hi>] hath three significations gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen it. First, that the iudgement of these indifferent acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whether well done or il, belongs to the Lord, and to none other. Secondly, that both weake and strong stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died &amp; sought not to offend but please the Lord, in that
<pb n="1148" facs="tcp:20835:572"/>
which they did, or did not. Thirdly, that they referred what they did, or what they omitttd to do, to the Lords honour. This last sence is both truest and fittest because of the words following, namely, that both the one and the other gaue God thankes, that is, honoured God. The stronger thanked God both for the abundance of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and their liberty in the vse of so many blessings. The weake gaue thanks for their slender diet, because it was to them a pledge of Gods loue, and fruite of Christs redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Note further touching the sence of the words, that these (Indicatiues) he regardeth, he giueth thankes, he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, he dyeth, verse 7. haue the force of (Imperatiues,) and are to bee vnderstood rather (<hi>de iure</hi>) shewing what ought to be done, then (<hi>de facto</hi>) telling what was done: like vnto that saying, 1. Tim. 3. A Bishop is the husband of one wife, that is, let him be the husband of one wife, &amp; Heb. 13, 3. Marriage is honourable, that is, it ought to be: And Mal. 2, 7. The Priests lips preserue knowledge, that is, it ought to doe so, Mat. 5, 13, 14.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>The doctrines of this sixt verse are these foure: First, there be some actions indifferent, such as in their owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be no sin, but may be done, or omitted and not done without fault: As there be somthings simply good, or good absolutely, which bee commaunded or forbidden in the worde; so some bee neyther good nor euill in respect of things done, but be of a middle quality. The proofe of this Doctrine is out of the Text: for seeing to obserue a day, and not to obserue it; to eate, and not to eate, bee actions directly contrary, yet our Apostle saith of them both, that they pleased the Lord, and tended both vnto his honour: Heere of it plainly followes, that some acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and things be of an indifferent nature, which may be done and God pleased; or not done, and yet God not offended.</p>
                     <p>A second proofe, is out of 1 Cor. 8, 8. whence I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="1149" facs="tcp:20835:572"/>
thus; That which being done or not done, makes vs neither better nor worse, must be indifferent. Thirdly, in this Chapter from verse 17. I argue thus: That certainly is in different, which neyther furthereth or hindereth Christianity and saluation: But such things are meates and drinkes (because the kingdom of God is not meates and drinkes,) therefore meates and drinkes bee indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. It is very true, that the abuse of these things by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse and riot, is not indifferent, but sinfull. Also where there is no such abuse, yet the intention of the doer may be sinnefull: as if one forbeare meates, with a purpose therein to do an holy and meritorious acte. Likewise, to eate and drinke, &amp;c. without faith, makes such actions sinfull, yea, though the things or actions about the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply considered in their owne Nature, are not euill nor good. Which as it rebukes such as doe deny <hi>Adiaphora,</hi> holding all things to be euill or good; so it instructeth vs to know, that where Gods word hath not ouer-ruled the case by precept or prohibition, there we do not sin, if we auoyd opinion of merite, superstition, scandall of the brethren, and contempt of good order and decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>It teacheth, that euen in indifferent actions (as eating and drinking) the honour of God ought to bee our end of them, and marke to ayme at; much more in actions necessary and commanded, 1 Cor. 10, 30. Math. 5, 16. Rom. 11, 36. Col. 3, 16, 17. Besides these Scriptures good reason enforceth this lesson. First, God is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning (all things are of him,) and he ought to bee the end of all (all things are for him.) And Prou. 16, 4. <hi>For himselfe</hi> (that is, for his glory) <hi>he made all things.</hi> As all Riuers come of the Sea, and returne thither; so al things ought to redound to his honour, as the end, seeing all is deriued from him as the beginning. Wee haue will and power from him to do that which is pleasing vnto him, Phil. 2, 13. the praise of all therefore belongs to him. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<pb n="1150" facs="tcp:20835:573"/>
Christ hath bought vs, our God gaue Christ a price for vs; therefore all our actions maine and meane, religious &amp; righteous, ought to glorifie him, 1 cor. 6, 20</p>

                     <speaker>Silat.</speaker>
                     <p>It reprooueth such as be so farre from intending Gods honour in euery action, as generally they thinke not once of the Lord and his glory. Secondly, such as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and purposely seeke their owne praise or pleasing of others or themselues, hauing no further drift, but as prophane worldlings and blinde Papists. Thirdly, such as do not that they do, to, but against the lord to dishonor him, and not for his honour, as wicked Epicures and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theists. Moreouer, from hence all are very earnestly to be exhorted, that whatsoeuer they take in hand, they do looke to the pleasing and honouring of God in it. For, seeing God in his actions toward vs, doth chiefly respect his owne glory. Rom. 3, 2. also 9, 24. Eph. 1, 6, 11, 4. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in all our duties towardes him, this should princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally be seene vnto, that he may bee magnified by our godly life. For there are three things required of them, which will be acceptable to the Lord: One, that it haue the word to warrant it, or not against it. Secondly, that it proceed from the root of faith, being done with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, that both action &amp; person please God through Christ. Thirdly, to these must be added an affection and sound desire, to haue God honoured, loued, and praised, by our meanes; without this our best doings are defiled. Therefore, as good seruants haue care of the credite of their Lord; and naturall children do study how to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the reputation of their parents, such ought to bee the disposition of all Christians, who are bound to striue hereunto, euen to haue the testimony of their conscience to witnesse, that in all vprightnes they desire &amp; seek this more then their owne wealth, credit, life, yea, or saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that their louing father and gracious Lord, may reap praise and honor by their obedience to his wil. This will giue more peace and true comfort to the soule, then all the world will do.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Yea, that it behooueth all Christians, especially Ministers, by <hi>Pauls</hi> example, to walke very wisehe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them which differ and be at variance among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. For sometimes he nameth the strong before the weake, as verse 2. and heere verse 6. the weake are put before the strong. Also, hee makes them both equall in this, that they intended Gods honour in omission, as wel as in facte; passing by the infirmities of both, that hee might not seeme partiall, and haue more hope to winne them to concord.</p>
                     <p>The reason heereof is: If among Christians which do contend in matters of Religion, any respect of person or inequality be vsed, more being yeelded to the one then to the other, vnkindnesse will be taken, iealousie kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, peace hindred, and the edge of all good exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons blunted: therefore, an euen hand must bee carried without leaning to any side. This rule holdeth, when differences grow through weaknesse, &amp; this wil require much wisedome and prayer: but with those which erre of malice, and are obstinate impugners of the truth, after lawfull instruction, <hi>Paul</hi> dealeth more roughly &amp; round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. See Gal. 5, 3, 4. and Chap. 4. also Phil. 3, 2. 2 Epistle of Iohn verse 10. Tit. 3, 10. Rom. 16, 17. Heere marke, that the Apostles are peremptory without fauour or indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence towards such as maintaine euill opinions in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, with an euill minde to depraue the trueth, and to corrupt their Brethren.</p>

                     <p>That Gods creatures and blessings ought to bee receiued with giuing of thankes to the Lord. See 1 Tim. 4, 3, 4. Col. 4. 2. and 3, 17. 1 Thess. 5, 18. To which, adde the example of Christ, Iohn 6, 11. and of <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 27, 35. The reasons of this duty (besides former precepts &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples) are first thankes giuing, which is a part of Gods seruice, Psal. 51. It makes to his honour and glorifying
<pb n="1152" facs="tcp:20835:574"/>
of his name. Againe, without it we haue not a pure and conscionable vse of the creatures and benefites of God: also vnthankefulnesse is odious to God, it hindreth the act of faith, and so turneth our eating and drinking into sin, Rom. 14. last verse.</p>

                     <p>This reprooueth such as foreslow this duty, and deride such as do it, or do it onely of custome for fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not as of duty and conscience to the word. Likewise such as turne it ouer to children in their owne presence, being themselues more able for gifts, and most bounde for Gods bounty and benefits to them: &amp; the excellent God looks &amp; deserues to be serued with most excellent graces. Lastly, it prouokes both our selus to frequent wil lingly and often this duty (there being nothing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with GOD is so pleased and honoured, as with heartie Thankesgiuing) and to teach our Children, and to see them do it on their own behalfe; but not to make them our mouthes, so long as we haue an heart and tongue to praise our God. Although Christes Disciples were men grown, yet he put not them to say grace in his presence; hee alwayes gaue thankes in his owne person, leauing a patterne for all Housholders to looke vpon, to doe the like, for his moral actions are our instructions.</p>

                        <hi>Paul</hi> resumeth and enlargeth the argument put down in verse 4. that all being seruants to one common Lorde (who with like good will, embraceth and ruleth ouer all his seruants with equall dominion, purchased by so great price as his own death) therefore they ought
<pb n="1153" facs="tcp:20835:574"/>
to dissent no longer, or mutually to condemne &amp; iudge one another, especially seeing the glory of the Lorde is sought for by his seruants.</p>
                     <p>The scope and drift, is to teach and confirme all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuers,<note place="margin">Scope.</note> to whom and to what they must liue and dy; not to themselues, and to their owne priuate purposes and praise, but to Christ their Lord, that hee in our life and death may be glorified. He confirmes and comfortes the godly that liue in all ages, that they should be verie full of comfort and ioy, seeing they haue a lord, who taketh more care of them in life and death, then they could do of themselues, being both able and willing to preserue them during their life, and being dead, to restore them to a neuerdying life. For his power is omnipotent, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming death in himselfe, beeing vniuersall Iudge of all; and for his will, he is so affected to all faithfull ones as to his owne redeemed, dearely purchased to bee his peculiar.</p>
                     <p>The order of these words is this. First, a proposition that no man liueth or dyeth to himselfe, verse 7. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a reason, because our life and death is to another, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Lord Christ, verse 8. Thirdly, a cause of this in the same verse, because we are the Lords in life &amp; death, therefore must liue and dye to him onely. Fourthly, an answere to a secret Obiection, if one should aske, How came Christ by this right and power in vs, and ouer vs? it is answered verse 9. By his death and resurrection, the end whereof, was to giue him Lordship ouer his church. In his death was paide the ransome, in his resurrection he possessed his dominion. For being dead so long, hee could not be Lord and Conqueror, but by rising againe he obtained it: and that he might for euer exercise this dominion, hee must both rise from death and reuiue, or continue aliue to continue an eternal Lord, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>I was dead, and am aliue;</hi> and <hi>Behold I liue for euer &amp; euer.</hi> Reuel. 1, 18. Rom. 6, 9. Christ being dead, dieth no more, death hath no more dominion ouer him. The sum
<pb n="1154" facs="tcp:20835:575"/>
of all is, that not onely in indifferent things, but in all our Christian actions we must like good seruants seeke the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of Christ our generall and rightfull Lord, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must lay aside our diuisions and discords, which are neither after his pleasure, nor to his praise and glory.</p>

                     <p>To liue to himselfe hath a two-fold signification, first ciuill, which is double: First, to depend on no man, but to liue of himselfe, without helpe from others, to bee beholden to no man: as <hi>Abraham</hi> would not take a shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lachet from the foure Kings which warred with him, Gen. 14, 23. <hi>Elisha</hi> would not at any hand take a guist from <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aman</hi> the <hi>Syrian,</hi> 2. Kings 5, 15, 16. Also in a ciuill sence it may import to care for none but for our selues, onely to minde our owne benefit, with neglect and contempt of all others: As in couetous misers, many vnmarried batchel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, and all worldlings doe, hauing a care of themselues and theirs alone, as if they were borne for none other.</p>
                     <p>The other sence wherein the Apostle vseth these words, is theologicall and Gospell-like, namely to liue after our owne minde, lust, and pleasure, doing our owne will, and seeking our owne praise, like to that Rom. 8, 5. 1. Cor. 10, 2. also 2. Cor. 5, 15. Our life when it is referred not to Christ, but to our owne commodities and honour, then we liue to our selues. Also when there bee none to grieue, mourne, and lament our death; which is the case of many widdowes, single persons, sole liuers, poore people, with whose death no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e is affected; this is ciuily to die to himself: but euangelically one dyeth to himselfe, when he findeth himselfe desolate, and there is none to care for him being dead, as if he were forelorne and cast off of Christ, this is the meaning heere.</p>

No flocke is so much the Shepheards, or inheritance so much the Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or Seruants their Lords, as we Christs. Secondly, it signifies, to render vp our selues to him, to doe not our owne, but his will. As seruants doe his will which hath ransommed them and freed them; with whom they haue made a Couenant, and from whom they haue taken wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and protection, 1 Sam. 22, 7. so we are bound to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and obey the will of Christ, to whom we are bound by solemne couenant, and from whom wee haue had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie many good things, and doe looke for more and greater, whose wil also is most holy. Thirdly, as seruants make their Lorde their refuge, so to flye to Christ in all our distresses and dangers: so <hi>Iacob,</hi> so <hi>Dauid,</hi> so <hi>Ezekiah,</hi> so <hi>Peter</hi> fled to Christ, <hi>Saue Lord or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Now, [<hi>To die to him</hi>] is to confesse him to be the onely Lorde of death, hauing it in his owne hand and power. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to submit with patience to the decree of death, after Christs example, Math. 26. Thirdly, to study how to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him in our death, by hope, patience, contentment, repentance, and feruent prayer to God, for our selues &amp; ours, and his whole Church; and by our counsels &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable speeches to such as stand about vs, (namely) our

And as the Admirall of <hi>France</hi> was dealt withall in <hi>Paris,</hi> &amp; <hi>Marlorate</hi> at <hi>Roane</hi> in <hi>Normandy:</hi> Yet Christ is their Lord and will be their Patron and auenger. Secondly, let such as liue to the Lord by obedience to his will, and zeale of his glory, free their hearts from feare of Purgatory faigned fire, yea and of truely tormenting hell fire, sithence they being purged by the bloud of their Lord, are deliuered thereby from all torments, and resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to life eternall.</p>

                     <p>I collect these doctrines: First, that Christ dyed
<pb n="1158" facs="tcp:20835:577"/>
truly and indeede, hauing his soule for a time violently separated from his body, whereof as the Sacrifices and Sacraments of the old Testament, namely the Paschall Lambe was a Type, 1 Cor. 5, 7. So the Lords Supper a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the new, is a liuely representation in distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting the bread apart from the Wine, and in the brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the bread, there is a signification of his painfull passion. Secondly, it was not so necessary that he should die to satisfy diuine Iustice, according to Gods eternall appointment, and most iust threatning, Thou shalt dye the death, Gen. 2, 17. and to fulfil the prophesies &amp; types of his death, and Legall sacrifices: but it was as needfull he should raise himselfe from the dead, because his death had not otherwise profited vs, either by merit or effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. For by this meanes he both declareth himselfe to be absolued from our sinnes, which he bare that hee might iustisy vs, Rom. 4, 25. and to be conqueror of death and graue, yea and to become fit to exercise that dominion and victory which his death had purchased. For being dead, he could not be victorious, so long as himselfe see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be conquered, neyther could he rule ouer the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, except he had beene made aliue; and he liueth for euer, that he may for euer gouerne his people, which are heere distributed into two sorts or rankes, 1. [the dead,] that is such as had departed this life from <hi>Adam</hi> vnto Christ, and 2. [by liuing] such are vnderstood as then did liue, or should liue from thenceforward to the end of the world.</p>
                     <p>Now, albeit Christ being risen, haue absolute power which he practiseth generally ouer all men good &amp; bad, euen ouer the diuels, as it is written, <hi>All power in heauen and earth is giuen mee,</hi> Math. 11, 27. and 28, 18. which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with Phil. 2, 9, 10. yet <hi>Paul</hi> extends his dominion in this place, no further then to beleeuers, ouer whome Christ doth rule for their saluation in a peculiar manner by his word and Spirite, as ouer his owne peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whose comfort and instruction the Apostle in this

                     <p>Heere is then the thirde Doctrine of this verse, that Christ dyed and rose not in vaine, but to this end, and to this very cause, to get a soueraignty ouer all the Electe, which either had liued, or did then, or should afterward liue in the world; all which, by good right, are subiect to him, as to their Lord, to be ruled and kept vnto salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in heauen. Which as it teacheth the Church of both Testaments to be but one, vnder one Lord of both: and that it comprehends vniuersally the Saintes before the law, vnder the law, &amp; vnder grace; all which make one bodie, and one family, whence the Church is intituled Catholike: so withall we learne, that the benefits of this Lord, as remission of sinnes, righteousnesse, adoption, saluation, &amp;c. reach no lesse to such as wer before Christ, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to them, who since Christ do liue, Ro. 3 25. Hebr. 9, 15. And moreouer, that they which be alreadie dead in his Faith, shall certainly be raised to heauenly glory, for so much as Christ is not Lord of the dead (as they bee dead) but as they are appointed to be aliue, for he is the Lord of all the liuing, Math. 22, 32.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, that there is great comfort vnto all the true seruants of God, inasmuch as both in life and death they haue a mighty and louing lord to care for them, to preserue and safegard them till hee haue crowned them. And finally, by this consideration they ought to keepe themselues from mutual discords and dissentions, liuing together in a peaceable and brotherly fashion: which as it is agreeable to the minde and will of their Lord, so it will tend much to his honour, and to the credite of our Christian profession: and that especially, if remembring that they are vnder his authority and rule, they take not leaue to liue as they list, but to his will and honour who hath brought them out of the power of darknes, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for sin by the righteous iudgment of God, they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled and captiuated, Acts 26, 16. Let them studye to serue him whose they are, after <hi>Pauls</hi> example, Acts 24,
<pb n="1160" facs="tcp:20835:578"/>
23. and follow his counsell, 2 Cor. 5, 5. Hee died and rose again, that henceforth we should liue, not to our selues, but after his will that dyed for vs.</p>

                     <p>To perswade the <hi>Romanes</hi> and in them all other Christians to concord about indifferent things by three new Arguments. First, from their condition, in that they are equals, being all Brethren; and equals may not mutually iudge each other: this argueth superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Secondly, from the office of Christ, who is the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall iudge of all, confirmed by a Text out of Esay 45, v. 23. Therefore, wee haue no neede to censure others, but to looke to our owne account, verse 12. Thirdlie, from the euent, which followes the vnseasonable abuse of our liberty, which is the scandall of the weake, verse 13. The last reason concernes the strong, the two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer both weake and strong.</p>

Whence we learne, that Ministers of the word are to take care, not onely of the matter, but of the very shape and fashion of their speech, that they vse a most piercing and moouing forme of words, as circumstances may require: for there is much force to make a thing gracious and powerfull, in the verie forme of words which be vsed.</p>

                     <p>Two: one is (to despise or set at nought:) this was the fault of such as had more knowledge of their Christian liberty, they esteemed vilely and lightly of the weaker sort, and disdained such as had lesse vnderstanding.<note place="margin">What is meant by Iudging.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other action is (iudging) which pertaineth to the weake in faith, and thereby is neyther meant the publike sentence which the Magistrate giues from the seate of ius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice against euill doers, nor yet that priuate sentence which Christians passe either against actions simply bad or good, or against persons already iudged of God in the worde, or with condition of their continuance in euill, (if they bee not such as the Scripture hath fore-iudged;) but the rash vncharitable iudgement touching the finall estate of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians for middle actions, as to pronounce peremptorily &amp; absolutely of any that they must perish, or bee past grace or cannot bee saued, because they are not of our minde in euery thing. That this is the meaning of the word (Iudge) there be two circumstances in the Text which fully preoue it: First, by that which went immediately before (of liuing and dying to the Lord, and beeing the Lords in life and death,) which shewes that these Romanes tooke vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to determine what should be the end and death of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and what should <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> come of them, as if they were Lords one of anothers life and death; also by mentioning the last iudgement, and ascribing the same vnto Christ, it appeares that they did vsurpe his office in giuing heauy doome of each others destruction: As at this day the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> do against such Churches that differ from them in things indifferent, as about breaking the bread in the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: and some of our hot brethren at home, haue had their finger too deepe in this faulte of iudging their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren too rigorously.</p>

                     <p>That it is not lawfull for Christians to passe their doome touching the euerlasting estate of any man, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is not apparant that hee hath committed that irremis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible sinne: 1.

forth. Also we see many wicked men suddenly &amp; migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily called and changed. Thirdly, we reade of one stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the market, called at the eleuenth houre to work in the vineyard.

                     <p>Fourthly, we are euen Brethren, one of vs no better then another, and therefore wee should not vsurpe this superiority, as one to iudge and condemn another. This is a gainst Brotherly charity, and Christian loue, which hopes well of all men, so farre as there is any cause or reason to induce vs. Finally, it is against the honour and dignity of the son of God, whom the father hath aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to this honor to be the Iudge of vs all.</p>

Secondly, it reprooues such as would take away from Christians all liberty of iudging, vnder this pretence, that wee may not for meane things iudge our Brethren finally: for that which is vtterly vnlawfull in some case, is, and may bee lawfull in some other cases; when circumstances vary, the matter it selfe is varied.</p>

First, the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersality of this iudgement [<hi>all we shall stand</hi>] weake and strong, learned and vnlearned, none are to be exempted from his iudgement, the iudge is vnpartiall, he will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with none. Secondly [<hi>we shall stand</hi>] or we must giue account, verse 12. This iudgement is vnauoydable. First, Gods decree hath purposed it, his word prophesied of it, his Iustice requireth it, 2 Thess. 1, 6, 7. Thirdlie, the manner how we shall appeare, Be presented or made to stand forth, euery one naked, himself and his cause both

before the Iudge, each one in his owne person.

Fiftly, the manner of his comming to iudgement, it shall<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15, 25, 26, 27, 28.</note> be glorious and full of Maiesty, for he shal haue a Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment seate, euen a throne very high in the clouds, Mat. 25, 31. and a white Throne, Reuel. 20, 11. to note the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocencie and vprightnesse of the Iudge, one to bee cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with no bribes, or blinded with ignorance, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of persons.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, the things which he shall do when he is come to iudgement, which are these. First, he shall make en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry of all men both their persons and actions; then he shall lay them open, and manifest them what they haue beene, and what they haue done. After that, he shal giue a righteous sentence vpon euery one according vnto his workes (which are as euidences and witnesses of Faith or vnbeleefe. Vpon which, shall follow speedy &amp; migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty execution, the wioked beeing cast downe into hell, shame, and torment: the righteous carried vp to heauen, there in blisse and glory to abide with Christ for euer: for this order of the iudgement, see Math. 25, from verse 31. to the end of the Chapter.</p>

To remedy this alwaies remember, (and let it neuer bee forgotten,) at thy rising vp and lying downe thinke of it, that thou must bee countable for thy selfe, to answere thy owne cogitations, words, and actions; Euery one shall beare his owne burthen, then euery tub shall stand on his owne bottome, euery fish hang by his owne gril.

First, it is against the rule of charity: se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly from the hurt which may come to our Brother, who is in daunger of destruction by the offence giuen him, yea, a wrong is done to Christ, in spilling the price of his bloode, verse 15. Thirdly, from an euill effect, it will cause so great good as Christian liberty, (yea, God the author of that good) to be reproached, verse 16.</p>

For this place speakes not of a passine offence, which is taken where
<pb n="1169" facs="tcp:20835:582"/>

                     <p>That all Christians must carefully looke to this, that they neuer be a iust occasion of sinning to any man, either by words or deedes, to hurt the saluation of any, or by building them vp vnto sinne by our euill examples in our sayings or dooings. For first, this is against the commandement of God, 1 Cor. 8, 9, 10. and 10, 32. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it puls downe heauy iudgements on our selues, Math. 18, 8. <hi>Better a Milstone were hanged about our necke, &amp;c.</hi> The world is full of examples of such as haue beene grieuously plagued of God, for being authors and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of sinne to others, as Gen. 3. the History of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eues</hi> fall, the Serpent punished more then <hi>Eue,</hi> and <hi>Eue</hi> more then <hi>Adam.

Ieroboam</hi> for making the <hi>Israelites</hi> to sin, more pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished then the Israelites themselues.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it is against the example of the blessed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, 1. Cor. 8, 13. Fourthly, by offence giuen wee breake the rule of charity, which shunneth the greeuances &amp; hurt of euery man, and studieth how to foster, help, and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then euen the weakest. As in a naturall body the stronger
<pb n="1170" facs="tcp:20835:583"/>
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber succoureth the feebler, or as a Phisition or Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion tenderly handleth a diseased or pained party: so loue is maruailous chary not to trouble or doe the least harme to the soule of any Christian brother, Rom. 14, 15. Fiftly, by offence giuing, wee sinne against our neighbour while wee beate, nay wound his weake conscience, (which is great cruelty) procuring him by our example to allow or doe some thing whereof in his conscience hee was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued, or which he knew he ought not to do, had not we made him to stumble, 1. Cor. 8, 12. Nay by our offence we destroy our brother so much as lyeth in vs, and become very butchers &amp; murtherers of our brothers soule, (eyther wholy driuing him away from the faith, or discouraging him:) and what a matter is this, for so slender a thing as meates and drinkes &amp; daies, or such like indifferent things, to bee the death and slaughter not of the body but of the precious soules of men? Rom. 14, 15. Lastly, this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth not to our brother alone, and to his destruction, but euen so high as Christ the head and Lord, against whome wee sinne in wounding or hurting any member or seruant of his, 1. Cor. 8, 12. There is that straight coniunction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene Christ and the faithfull, that the good or the euill offered to them redounds to him. Mat. 25, 45. Also how can wee by our offence giuen, make voide the fruite and force of Christs death, towards our brother offended by v, (so much as we may, and no thankes to vs if it bee not so) what other thing (I say) can this be then to sinne against Christ, by plucking from him one whom he hath so deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bought? Which ought not to bee vnderstood as if any effectually redeemed by the death of Christ, and by faith ingrafted in him, could indeed perish, (as <hi>Huberus</hi> &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Lutherans</hi> teach) for this is most firmely to be held (as <hi>Augustine</hi> saith,) That none of the predestinate can vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall away from grace, for then Gods election should be frustrate, and Christ vntrue, who saith, It is vnpossible, Mat. 24. And his loue changeable, Iohn 13, 1. His coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant broken, Iere. 31, 32. Christs intercession vnauaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="1171" facs="tcp:20835:583"/>
Iohn 17, 15, 20, 21. Gods wisedome decelued, his power and goodnesse ouercome and vanquished by mans sinne: all which are not onely absurd but impossible, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit in respect of mans weakenesse, ready to fall, euen as a young childe, or a sicke person soone ouerturned: and the extreame power and malice of Sathan, that like a Dragon is able to shake and pull downe Cedars, euen strong ones, if God permit. And lastly, in regard of the great &amp; dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous temptations and scandals which sore tempt vs; it is true that the beleeuer may be destroyed, and when any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is giuen them, then what lyeth in the party that put the blocke in his brothers way, hee casteth his brother downe headlong to eternall destruction: but the mighty God with his hand vpholds all his, not from falling but from falling away.</p>

                     <p>It instructeth vs to know that such things as in respect of their nature bee not euill, and which otherwise we might doe, yet if they proue scandals and hurts to our brethren, we ought to shun them as things sinfull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull: for that meate which may be eaten if no offence follow, to eate it with offence is euill to him that doth it, Rom. 14, 20. and the like we are to iudge of all other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things, that accidentally by the scandall annexed to them, they cease to be indifferent, and pollute him that doth them with offence. Secondly, here is an admonition to all Christians which openly commit grosse sinnes, and by their example teach others to doe the like. Also to parents, Maisters and all Gouernors, which in the presence of their inferiors haue spoken or done wicked things, or foreslowed good duties, as prayer, reading, &amp;c. edifying them in iniquity by such naughty practises, and by sins of omission, that betimes vpon the former reasons they moue themselues to hearty repentance, for the scandall and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences they haue set before others. For seeing Christ hath said it, Woe must bee to such by whom offences come, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept such as giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be truly humbled, turning to God, &amp;
<pb n="1172" facs="tcp:20835:584"/>
desiring forgiuenesse of his mercy, fully purposing to walke without offence heereafter: for certainely they shall feele the curse of God, which doe giue occasion of harme to the soules of heedelesse men, seeing a cursse is threatned, Deut. 27, 18. Will God poure his curse and vengeance on them who make the blinde stumble to the hurt of his body, &amp; wil he not much more do this to soul destroyers?</p>

                     <p>Now that we haue done with the doctrine of offences, and proued it by reasons both forreigne, and bred in the Text, let vs heare what we are to learne from the obiection in the 14. verse, and first what it is (to be perswaded through the Lorde Iesus?)</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Through the Lord Iesus, signifies not the merit of his death (as some thinke,) for before the time of his passion, nothing was vncleane in his owne nature, but either 1. generally through <hi>Adams</hi> sinne, which polluted all, or 2. morally by intemperancie and ryot, or 3. Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monially prohibited, as certaine Beasts vnder the Law, or 4. scrupulously and superstitiously of such as doubt of the lawfulnesse of lawfull meates. It signifies therefore, by the teaching and instruction of Christ, by whose spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit he knew and was perswaded (not probably and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecturally, as the word is vsed when the Scripture speaks of other mens faith and constancy, as Rom. 15, 14. 2 Tim. 1, 5. Heb. 6, 9.) but certainly, infallibly, and assuredly, so as he knowes it could not be otherwise. In which sence, the word is vsed when a man speakes of his owne Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and saluation, as Rom. 8, 20. For euery man knowes best his owne heart, and those things that himselfe hath receiued of God. 2 Cor. 2, 12.</p>

And they doe falsly teach the doctrine of faith, who deny to it infallible certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And lastly, it is a good token both of the being and growing of faith in a Christian heart, the more firmely and strongly it doth apprehend and sticke to the word. Moreouer, from the 14. verse we are taught, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists defile &amp; pollute Gods creatures to themselues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they iudge them to be vncleane, for meates bee as they are esteemed, vncleane to him that thinks them so.

                     <p>It hath a new argument to disswade from giuing offence to the weak in our christian liberty about meats, thus. We may not do ought which may cause our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian liberty to be euill spoken of; but for the strong to eate with offence to the weake, it wil cause our commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity to be euill spoken off: therefore offences ought to be auoided. For exposition of the words, howsoeuer by your good or commodity, some vnderstand their faith, or hope of glory, or godlinesse; yet the matter in hande which is to direct to the right vse of christian libertie in middle things, and the comparing this Text with 1 Cor. 10:29. wher that is stiled Liberty which here is phrased Good, doth clearely open this place to be meant of this liberty which might be (blasphemed,) that is, reproched and euill spoken of, and Christ also by it, of two sorts of persons. First, of our infirme and weake Brethren, who
<pb n="1174" facs="tcp:20835:585"/>
(not knowing but that <hi>Moses</hi> Lawes, touching certaine meates prohibited, and difference of dayes, were still in force) might by the vndue &amp; vntimely vse of this liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (by such as had better instruction, and knew that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus in his death, had abolished those Leuitical shadows) be brought to mislike Christ and his Gospell, as contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>Moses,</hi> and to open their mouths to reproach this Christian liberty taught by the Gospell, and so to fal off againe from the Faith which they had before submitted vnto.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, by strangers who were without the Church, and might say; Lo these are the Christians, they cannot agree, one holds one thing, another the contrarie, what concord is this? what a Religion is this? As our Papists by our home diuisions, take occasions to blaspheme our Religion, forgetting their own domesticall contentions in more and waightier mttters. See M. Doctor <hi>Halles</hi> Booke intituled the Peace of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is nothing lesse then at vnity in it selfe, yet vpbraids diuision to vs.</p>

                     <p>This teacheth, that Christian liberty is a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, seeing it enfreeth vs from the yoake and bondage of ceremonies: therefore we owe thankes to God for it, that we may freely and lawfully feed on such creatures, as <hi>Salomon</hi> in all his glory, might not touch without sin.

<pb n="1175" facs="tcp:20835:585"/>
then any of the former. It is this, the kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen stands not in these indifferent things, therefore wee may not with the scandall and destruction of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren contend about them. In which reason, the Apostle seemeth somewhat closely to insinuate vnto the rebuke of the: strong, as if they had beene too eager and earnest in these externall matters, placing piety, and pleasing of God in them, as if all our good and happinesse had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on them; not so (saith <hi>Paul,</hi>) the kingdom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth in more waightie things, as righteousnes, peace, and ioy in the Spirit; and not in such outward indiffrent matters, as meates and dayes, and the like, which in no whit appertaine to Gods worship and mans saluation. The parts of this 17. verse bee two; the one affirmatiue, the other negatiue. In this latter, it is denied, that the kingdome of God is meate and drinke; in the other, it is affirmed, that it is in righteousnesse, peace, and ioy. The holy Ghost (who as an efficient cause) distinguisheth worldly righteousnesse, peace and ioy, from that which is both Religious and Christian, comming not of the Flesh, but from the Spirit, being in spirituall, not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall things; and therefore, the fit and meete matter of the Kingdome of GOD, which consisteth not of this world.</p>

                     <p>Amongst sundrie acceptions, there bee two es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, whereof I now make vse. First, the estate of grace, whereby Christraigneth in our hearts by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite: this is called [Kingdome,] because it is the ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance into, and the way vnto the Kingdome aboue. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Kingdome signifieth the estate of glorie and blisse in heauen, where because God shall fully reigne in his Saints, and immediately; not as heere vnperfect and by meanes of the word: therefore it is tearmed also, and more cheefly the Kingdom of God. I see nothing against it, why the Text may not bee expounded in both these
<pb n="1176" facs="tcp:20835:586"/>
sences, without wrong to phrase, or circumstance, or scope. For following the first sence, putting kingdome for that grace whereby we are reconciled to God, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to please him, then the meaning is; that since there is no necessity of meates to this purpose, as to bring vs to Gods fauour, and make vs acceptable to him, 1 Cor. 8, 8. (which teacheth, that meates nor drinkes make vs neither more nor lesse acceptable vnto God;) therefore there ought to be no difference about them, to the scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall one of another (especially if wee embrace the latter sence) our saluation is neither hindred nor furthred by meates and drinkes: therefore a folly it is to contend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout these things which shall not bee necessarie in the kingdome of heauen, as one saith; nor of any vse in our celestial conuersation, (as <hi>Origen</hi> writeth) nor the things that must bring vs to heauen, as <hi>Chrysostom</hi> speaks, nor the cause of our reigning there. There is a Synecdoche in these tearmes of meates and drinkes, for they are put for all other things of a middle Nature; whatsoeuer they be, they do no whit at al belong to Gods worship now, or mans felicity heereafter, being simply considered in themselues.</p>

                     <p>Euen this, that things that be indifferent, are of no necessity vnto the seruice of God, or sauing of our soules. The proofes heereof, first from authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Mat. 15, 11. 1 Cor. 8, 8. Heb. 13, 9. 1 Tim. 4, 4. 8. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to these Scriptures, our English Church hath iudged these meates, &amp;c. to be vnnecessary in their own Nature, either to holinesse or happinesse, the cleare light of the word hauing taught vs: as the words of the statute be, An. 3. of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. that one day, or one kinde of meate of it selfe, is not more holy, pure, or cleane then another; and that no meates at any time, can defile any Christian, and that all meates are lawful, so they be not vsed in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience and vice, but be receiued with sobrietie and
<pb n="1177" facs="tcp:20835:586"/>
thankesgiuing to God, and sanctified by the word and prayer: therefore, howsoeuer with a ciuill abstinence at certaine seasons is well commanded, and ought accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to be practised: yet no Religion is to be placed in such abstinence from meats: whereof this reason may bee rendred, that by meates neither is the heart streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened in grace, or polluted with sinne, made neyther wiser nor better, holier or happier.</p>

and so do the Papistes indirectly, and by necessarie consecution.

What is this else, but to fulfill the prophesie of the Apostle, 1. Tim. 4, 2. in hypocrisie and coloured wordes to make all meates vncleane at some time, and to some men at all times, as if meates were the Kingdome of God, or if the kingdome were to be won or lost by meates or drinkes?</p>

                     <p>That meates and whatsoeuer other indifferent things are more slight, then that Christians ought to contend about them: for seeing they are no parts, either of Law or Gospell, what reason haue Christians to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent for them? Indeed for such things that please or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please God, as precepts of the Law, promises of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, faith, and obedience, towards God, we are strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to stand, and earnestly to contend for such things, Iude 3. whereof we haue <hi>Paul</hi> for example, Galat. 2, 11. What may wee iudge then of those Papistes and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, which chafe and fret for neglect of a humane Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, being colde and carelesse about Christian du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, tything Mint, and Annice, and neglecting greater things of the Law, stumbling at strawes, and leaping o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer blockes?

                     <p>First, the condition or parts of Christs kingdom, which consisteth not in meates or in other externall things, bur in things inward and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, (to wit) righteousnesse, peace, and ioy, such as come from the Holy-Ghost and are not carnall, nor can bee lost, verse 17. Secondly, a reason from the effects, thus; In these things we serue Christ and please God, but the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God doth stand in seruice of Christ, and pleasing of God; therefore righteousnesse, peace, and ioy, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to the kingdome, and not meates, verse 18. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a conclusion, that sithence peace is one part of religion and of the kingdome, therefore by all meanes Christians are to imbrace that, and to put away strife about other vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary things, verse 19. But least wee should thinke that euery kinde of peace should bee followed, hee adioyneth thereunto edification, verse 20. An edifying peace is to be followed, and whatsoeuer belongs to it, as charity, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing, concord, forgiuing one another, meekenesse, and all other furtherances of peace be diligently to bee sought for. Vnto this edifying peace there is set against it, as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite, destroying contention. Fourthly, an answere vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a secret obiection: But seeing all meates are pure, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and granted of God as lawfull to vse, why should it not be good for me to eate of all meates, whatsoeuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="1180" facs="tcp:20835:588"/>
of other men? Not so saith <hi>Paul,</hi> for though al meats be good, yet they bee not good to him which eateth with offence to his brother, verse 20.</p>

                     <p>Righteousnesse signifies iustice imputed, or of the<note place="margin">Righteousnes</note> person beeing absolued from sinnes, and accepted righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous through faith in Christ. Secondly, inherent iustice, righteousnesse of workes, or that which the Scripture cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth sanctification or holinesse of life, begun in such as are<note place="margin">Peace.</note> iustified by faith. Peace signifies inward peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, quieted in respect of reconciliation with God, and remission of sinnes: also outward concorde with the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; this beeing a fruite of inward peace of the soule, as that followeth iustification by faith, Romanes 5, 2. By<note place="margin">Ioy.</note> ioy is vnderstood the sweete motion of a Christian soule cheered vp and made glad, partly by present sence of Gods loue shed into the heart, and partly out of hope of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to come, Rom. 5, 3, 5, 6.

Of these three ye may reade at large before, namely in the Dialogue vpon the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fift Chapter. The Holy-Ghost is added here, both to note the efficient cause of Christian righteousnes, peace, and ioy: also to distin guish Christian righteousnes, peace, and ioy, from that which is worldly and carnal, grounded vpon earthly thinges, and being also vnconstant.</p>

                     <p>That things which be necessary to the kingdome<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> (that is, to religion and saluation) they bee spirituall and inward things, such as by the Holy-Ghost are wrought in the soule, as namely iustification by faith, peace of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ioy in the Holy-Ghost: which is not so to bee taken, but that charity, repentance, godlines, meekenes, patience, temperance, truth, goodnesse, fidelity, &amp;c. doe belong to the kingdome. But these three are heere named, as chiefe, and cause or ground of the rest, which bee vnseparably
<pb n="1181" facs="tcp:20835:588"/>
linked to these. For iustifying faith as a glorious Lady, after her doth draw a traine of Christian graces, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be where faith goeth before, as <hi>Ruth</hi> would be wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer <hi>Naomy</hi> was: and righteousnesse of workes contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all vertues in it. Also the ministry of the word, prayer, and Sacraments, though externall things, yet they haue relation to these spirituall things, whereof they be the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping causes or instruments to beget or increase, and so belong to the kingdome. The reasons why the kingdome standeth in such spirituall things is, God beeing a Spirite, Iohn 4, 24. the things of his kingdome must bee spirituall, and sutable to himselfe whoe is the King. Secondly, his kingdome is not of this world, Iohn 18, 36. therefore not in worldly but in inward &amp; heauenly things his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome consists.</p>

                     <p>It serues to prouoke all men with all endeuour to seeke after righteousnesse, to haue their sinnes forgiuen them, to be partakers of Christs iustice, and to worke righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, leading a iust life, to get the blessing of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased and pacified conscience, and a ioyfull heart vnder hope of glory, without which we haue no fellowship with the kingdome, no part in saluation: and let all such as haue receiued grace to beleeue, and by their faith doe receiue the iustice of Christ to bee their owne, and are regenerate to liue iustly, hauing peace with God and men, reioycing vnder the hope of glory, though but in a weake measure and with much imperfection; Let them I say, much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort themselues, and continually praise the God of heauen, which hath imparted to them such thinges that are so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to true religion and eternall saluation.

                     <p>That not by these things (as if wee could merite by them: for they are effects of grace, not causes of the kingdome) but in these things we serue Christ and please God: to serue Christ is by faith and obedience to cleaue to him. After this manner Christ will be serued, and God will be pleased, and both wee and our doings will bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of him, if we fetch righteousnes from Christ alone, drawing from him and his promises matter of sound tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility and in ward cheerefulnesse, indeuouring to liue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly and godlily. Now what should wee study rather to procure, then that we may serue Christ our Redeemer, and please God our Creator and preseruer? for it is the end of our creation, redemption, and conseruation, to serue and glorifie Christ, and to please God. Therefore how earnestly should these things bee striuen for and searched after, which doe inable vs to honour and please both God the Father, and Christ the Sonne? See how much they are deceiued, which in popery doe place the seruice of God and pleasing of Christ for the most part, in outward rites and ceremonies deuised by themselues, whereas the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices of the law, and the ordinances of the Gospell bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing seuered from these inward things, are abhorred of God, Esay 1, 13, 14, 15. Mat. 7, 22, 23. Gods owne holye institutions are no whit auaileable to serue &amp; please Christ, nay they be an abhomination if they bee not ioyned with faith, &amp;c.</p>

He is not the seruant of God, which either pleaseth men, rather then God, or God without all care of men: God first, and for himselfe; Men after, and for God.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, that we must pursue peace with our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that is, seeke it with vehement desire, not coldly nor carelesly, seeing peace pertaineth to Religion and saluation, it must needes be eagerly followed after, after the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> exercising and hunting after peace with <hi>Lot,</hi> and of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who sought to liue peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably with all men, Psal. 120. whose counsel is, we should follow peace, Psal. 34, 14. <hi>Haue peace with all.</hi> See Rom. 12, 18. Secondly, as we loue peace, we must get and look after such things as belong vnto peace, euen all graces which be Parents to breed, or Nurses to foster peace, as milde speech, courteous behauiour, forbearing reuenge, pardoning errors, passing by offences, interpreting of doubtfull thinges to the best part, soft aunsweres, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect silence, or whatsoeuer else may cause or confirme peace.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, we must beware of the quite contrary, of all things which may be hinderances to peace, as hatred, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy, desire of reuenge, fiercenesse, busie medling, debate, strife, whispering, backbyting, and tale-bearing, &amp;c. as a sword point, or as a Scorpion, so are these to be auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="1184" facs="tcp:20835:590"/>
of them that loue peace. Fourthly, Christians are to embrace such peace as tends to edification. We are Gods house and Temple, 1 Cor. 6, 19. 1 Cor. 3, 9. 2 Cor. 6, 16. As in a naturall building, many workemen ioyne their labout together, to perfect one building; so Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians must with ioynt care, diligence, and study, do such things as make men better, more godly and religious, more strong in Faith; and this is to edifie, which prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally pertaineth to the Ministery, Eph. 4, 11, 12. yet rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth euen to professors, who as liuing stones, must strengthen and helpe one another to Godward.</p>
                     <p>There is a peace in euill, when persons agree in super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, heresie, in vnrighteousnesse, theft, and cruelty: as<note place="margin">Note this.</note> 
                        <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Leui</hi> brethren in euill, <hi>Herod</hi> &amp; <hi>Pilate</hi> against Christ, the false Apostles against <hi>Paul,</hi> agreed. This is a wicked peace, it tends not to edifying in godlines, but to destruction, and maketh men fall from God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come worse and worse, and therefore is to be abhorred. <hi>Zachary</hi> ioyneth peace and truth. Zach. 8, 16. Peace and holinesse put togither, Heb. 12, 14. Peace and edification in this text. Thus the Scripture sets our bounds for peace which we may not passe: a necessary and holy contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is to be preferred to an impious peace.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Namely, that our Brothers faith and saluation, (which be the worke of God) ought to be so deare to vs as we ought not to ouerthrow it by our offensiue eating. For howsoeuer all meates bee pure and lawfull in theyr owne nature, and by Gods ordinance, yet our eating is euill if the peace of the Church be troubled, or edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hindered, or offence giuen to such as be weak. Where indifferent things cannot be vsed, but with disturbance of Christian concord, with losse of peace amongst Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, with hurt and destruction to the infirme, with scandall &amp; offence, then they cease to to be indifferent, and the vse of them is euill, as <hi>Illyricus</hi> and <hi>Paraeus</hi> teach from this place.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>Whether are we to abstaine from eating flesh, if we bee in the presence of a superstitious Papist, who makes conscience of it, least we offend him?</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>If such a Papist be simply seduced by others, and hath had no meanes of knowledge by instruction and doctrine of the word, then there is the more regarde to be had of him: he is first to be shewed in good fashion, that all creatures are good and lawfull at all times, and nothing in it selfe vncleane, but to them that thinketh it so, or which eateth with offence against his conscience; these make meates which bee pure, to be vnpure for vse to themselues.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if it bee an vnderstanding Papist, then the case is altered: for there is great difference betweene a weake Iew, and an obstinat Romanist. First, because such an one is not to be held a Brother, as I haue proued be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, chap. 12. and we are commanded to auoyde giuing offence to such as be brethren. Secondly, these meates, as flesh of all kinds, and white meates were neuer forbid by <hi>Moses</hi> Law, as those were which the vnskilful Iewes made conscience of. Thirdly, these Papistes haue had time enough, and meanes enough also, to haue learned Christian liberty; it hath beene demonstratiuely proued, that there is no religion in difference of meats, but they wilfully shut their eyes against the light that shines in their face; and therefore offend not out of ignorance &amp; infirmity as the Iewes did, but out of malicious stuborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which we are by no meanes to cherish.</p>

                     <p>But what shall we say, if a Protestant well instructed in his liberty, yet ready to take offence to see flesh eaten of them which are healthfull, being done against the Kings Lawes?</p>

                     <p>Better neuer to eate flesh, then to eat with scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall of thy Brother. For if hee now be moued to eate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his conscience, by seeing thee to eate, then hee is destroyed by the vntimely vse of thy liberty.

Contempt of authority, breach of wholesome lawes, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with euill example to imbolden others to transgresse, are faults which displease God, and defile the conscience, and deserues punishment both temporal and eternal.

                     <p>Howsoeuer some distinguish them and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand (by slumbling) that which elsewhere is called the wounding of the weake conscience, being troubled &amp; not knowing what to hold or doe, 1.

Cor. 8, 11. and (by being made weake) that which before in verse 15. was in other tearmes saide to be grieued. (Of which distinction there may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this good obseruation, that so soone as wee see the conscience of our brother begin to wauer by our actions, it is our duty to cease &amp; giue ouer ere it come to be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and wracked;) yet for my part I doe rather iudge that one and the selfe same thing is signified heere by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping vp of diuers words, namely thereby the better to insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate that great heed, care, and circumspection be taken, (as he saide before verse 13.) that no stumbling blocke or occasion of sinning bee put in our brothers way, which might be eyther by making them doe that which they saw others doe with a wauering minde; or causing them to detest the faithfull, as prohaneners of <hi>Moses</hi> law, by going against his prohibitions in vse of dayes and meates.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, it is much better in case of offence, to sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare our liberty in things indifferent, then to vse it, as the saluation of a Brother, is a farre more precious thing then the nourishing of our flesh or body.

                     <p>In the 22. Verse, what is meant by Faith, [Thou hast Faith,] for with M. Beza, I had rather reade these Wordes by way of concession, then by interrogation, Hast thou faith?</p>

I know and beleeue my liberty which I haue by Christ, that nothing is vnpure to me, why should not I prosesse it in words, and expresse it in acte, without respect had of others? This Obiection the Apostle answeres first by granting, Thou hast this Faith, I yeeld it vnto thee. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by distinguishing thus: Haue thy faith vnto thy selfe, in thine owne Conscience, but expresse it not to the hurt of thy Brother, (for this must be vnderstood ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily) enioy thy knowledge to thy edification, but vse it not to anothers destruction.</p>

Thou needest not make any ostentation of it to the hurt of thy brother: let it euen be enough to thee that God knowes thy faith.

                     <p>What then, is it lawfull for Christians to dissemble their Faith and profession of it? Will it bee sufficient in time of persecution, to haue Faith in his heart before God? Howe then hath Christ commanded vs, to confesse him before men? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so see Rom. 10, 10. where both faith and confession, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired vnto saluation.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Our Apostle heere speaketh neither of generall Faith by which we beleeue the whole word both of Law and Gospell; nor yet of iustifying Faith, whereby wee receiue Christ, or the promises of Christ vnto saluation, but of a particular faith, whereby we beleeue something to be lawfull. Secondly, euen this particular faith (which is a perswasion of our liberty in indifferent things) is the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> onely to be concealed, when it cannot bee professed and practised, without offence and scandall vnto our weake brother. Not the profession then, but the vnseasonable hurtfull profession of this faith, is heere prohibited. Heerewith a greeth the iudgement of <hi>Chrysostome</hi> vpon this place: This text (saith he) is not to be vnderstoode of the faith of doctrine, but of that which appertaineth to the argument in hand, namely, the Faith about things indifferent. Touching the former faith (saith hee) it is written, <hi>With the Mouth confession is made to Saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Againe, <hi>He that denieth me before men, before my Father will I deny him.</hi> This faith is oppressed, if it be not expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; but the other faith about middle things is then sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted, when it is vnseasonably shewed.</p>

                     <p>Hee giueth three short and pithy rules to direct both strong and weake, in the vse of things indifferent: The first concernes the strong onely; the second the weak onely; the third them both: The first is set downe by way of acclamation, O blessed is the man which condemneth not himselfe in that which he allowes. Touching the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
<pb n="1190" facs="tcp:20835:593"/>
of which rule note, that Apostle speakes first touching a mans condemning himselfe, and not beeing condemned of others, or making themselues worthy to be condemned of others. Secondly, he speaketh of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and allowing in the same person, not of disallowing in another what he persormes in himselfe. Thirdly, hee is to be vnderstood of one and the same instant whereby one man in his iudgement condemneth, and in his practise al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth one and the same thing. The summe then of the rule is thus much, that hee is indeede a happy man whose practise in outward acte agrees with the inward iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his conscience. More plainely thus: In conscience to be perswaded, that a weake brother is not to bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by vndue and vntimely exercise of our liberty, so to allow this, as by no contrary deede to condemne it, it is the happinesse of a man not to bee accused of his heart. Let all men striue for this happy condition, after the examples of <hi>Iob,</hi> chap. 27, 6. and of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Corinth. 1, 12.</p>

                     <p>He that doubts is damned if he eate, because hee eates not of faith, that is, not beleeuing so in his heart, as hee shewes in acte. The rule more at large is thus much: that such a one is guilty of sinne, hurts his conscience, and offends God, which eyther eates or doth any thing else with a wauering doubtfulnesse, and not beeing well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded, whether they doe well or ill, please God, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please him. A Christian which will please God and keepe his conscience pure and vnspotted, must be able to discerne of that which he doth, whether it bee lawfull or vnlawful, according to that which is written before, Let euery man be perswaded in his owne minde: to doe a thing which is good, and yet do it doubtingly, (the minde beeing tossed too and fro with diuers reasons) doth pollute the action to him that doth it, and makes it to be sinne, lacking right rule, and end: for it is neyther gouerned by knowledge of the word, nor done to Gods glory. Let men therefore
<pb n="1191" facs="tcp:20835:593"/>
learne to resolue of their deeds before they acte it, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpise nothing so long as ones conscience and minde is doubtfull, what he may doe: for so long our deeds cannot be referred to Gods praise, and this very thing is enough to make it sinfull; for it is sinne whatsoeuer misseth of the due end.</p>

Thirdly, weake ones eate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faith, for to the strong onely is faith ascribed, verse 22: but not without conscience, 1. Cor. 8. and 1.

This is the faith which is grounded vpon the word, and giueth certaine direction both what we are to beleeue and doe: the workes then of all Infidels and naturall men are sinfull, though glorious for shew, and good for substance; because they come not from faith, and whatsoeuer comes of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Wicked men (saith <hi>Chrysostome</hi>) delight in that which themselues inuent, but the faithfull measure all by the word, whether they thinke, speake, or do. They shewe themselues to bee but hickscorners and cauellers which to ouerthrow this wholesome doctrine of gouerning

our whole Christian course, and euery step of our way, to heauen, by the word of Faith, doe most childishly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that then for the taking vp of a chippe or a straw, &amp;c. we must haue our warrant from the Scripture, which we say is our mistris to teach vs Religion and all maners, both faith and life, 2 Tim. 3, 15, 16.</p>
                     <p>Any thing that is of saluation to be beleeued, as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Faith, or practised as a seruice of God, or done as a duty to God, to men, or to our selues, wee are to haue our warrant either from the expresse worde, or by some necessary deduction and consequence from it: for it teacheth all truth of godlinesse, it conuicteth all error in religion, it reprooueth all vice, it instructeth in euery vertuous way. The wayes of the young man (to whom for his youth some liberty might be allowed) yet be not cleane and pure, except they bee purged and ordered by the word, Psal. 119, 9. which how is it a Lanthorn to our feete, and a light to our steps, if there be any part of our Christian faith and conuersation, for which it giueth not direction? For if it be so perfect, as it hath sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to enable the man of God to euery good worke of his calling how much more men of other vocations? Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily then haue the ancient Doctors of the Church (as I haue tofore shewed) honoured the worde of Scriptures with this commendation, that it is <hi>Regula Religion is &amp; morum; Magistra Fidei &amp; vitae: norma Controuer siarum &amp; canuersationis.</hi> For what imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can be in that word which hath bin inspired by a Spirit of infinite wisedom? Would the most wise and good God leaue to his Church but halfe a rule, a lame &amp; maimed Canon? which should be supplied by decrees and traditions of men, by good intentions of our owne (as they are called,) by direction of reason, by suggestion of euery mans conscience? As our Romanists would haue [Faith,] in this text, to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of the perswasion of euery mans conscience; so as an Heathen and Infidell doing that which in reason &amp; conscience he iudgeth right, that cannot be sinne: but
<pb n="1193" facs="tcp:20835:594"/>
whatsoeuer any doth (beleeuing it in his conscience to be lawfull) that is a good worke, and pleaseth God. If this were spoken of a conscience, and of reason groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the word of God, it were well; but being gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally vttred, it is not well: for the very Gun-powder Traitors made conscience of their doing.</p>
                     <p>The conscience is made good by the knowledge and<note place="margin">Acts 15, 9.</note> faith of the word, without which, there is no right and<note place="margin">Titus 1, 15.</note> godly vse of our reason. By benefit whereof, howsoeuer we may doe things naturally or morally good, yet not spiritually good, so as God be pleased.

Heb. 11, 6. Though we do not say, that the making and ministring good Lawes, education of Children, reuerence of Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, succouring of Parents, speaking truth, keeping promises, defending their countrey, &amp;c. in Paganes and prophane Christians be sinfull, but rather vertuous acts,<note place="margin">An Infideil is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Strong or mightie, signifies Christians of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter knowledge and more pure life, such as were better taught, and of greater holynesse. Note that he putteth
<pb n="1196" facs="tcp:20835:596"/>
himselfe into the number of the strong [<hi>Wee,</hi>] not out of ambition, but in truth as it was (for he had extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry gifts and reuelations) to set himselfe for an example of his owne doctrine, the better to mooue others to doe that which they perceiud him to do before them. As <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deou</hi> in the Iudges 7, 17. saide to his men: so euery Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster should say to his flocke, What ye see me do, that do yee.

By weake are meant the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not in body but in minde, being inferiour to others in knowledge and godlinesse. And though the worde Englished (infirmities,) do reach to all weaknesses both in state by want; in sexe, as of women; in bodye, as by sicknesse and old age, all which we are to beare with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in pittying and releeuing them as we may; yet here are to be vnderstood spiritual weakenesses (not great vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and open crimes, murther, periury, adultery, &amp;c.) as errors in Doctrine, which be not against the foundation, ignorance in some truth, forgetfulnesse, &amp;c. also sudden passions of anger, griefe, &amp;c. and faylings or slips in life which do not ouerturne honesty of maners, as some rash and ydle speech, &amp;c. these be called infirmities, that is, the sicknesses and maladies of the Christian soule, which is shewed to be weake by them. To beare these infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it is a speech borrowed from the frame of mans bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, where the bones (which be the strongest parts) doe beare vp the flesh and other weake partes; or else from buildings, where the pillars do beare vp the burthen of the house.

and fraileties, are vnto such as liue with them; they are such a burthen as one takes vp with griefe, and layes downe with pleasure: such as haue much to deale with them, feele it to be so to their great molestation.</p>
                     <p>This doctrine serueth both to humble the weak to walke<note place="margin">Vse.</note> in more lowlinesse, and to labour for more strength, that they may bee lesse irke some and grieuous.

This duty of bearing hath in it these soure actions: First with patience to suffer. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with compassion to pitty and pardon imperfections. Thirdly, with wisedome to admonish. Fourthly, with loue to correct and reproue, that they may be healed. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of this duty be these: First, we are members one of another. Secondly, we haue one neede of another in some things, as in other things they haue need of vs. Thirdly, we must doe as we would bee done too. Fourthly, lawe of nature teacheth stronger to helpe weaker, as it is done in a naturall body. Fiftly, the law of God commands to lift vp our neighbours sheepe beeing fallen into a ditch, much more is this to bee done to a feeble brother that fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth into any sinne. Sixtly, the weake in faith, are like to the sicke in body, and who would not pitty and helpe such as cannot helpe themselues? They are like to little children which stumble and fall, and such who would not take vp? Did a <hi>Samaritane</hi> kindly intreate a wounded <hi>Iewe,</hi> and should not wee kindly respect a weake brother?

he spared not himselfe, to doe good to others, hee refused no shame nor smart to procure vs eternall case and glory: being in his estate poore, in his name reuiled, rayled on: in his body whipt, pierced, wounded, crucified: in his soule filled with anguish, sorrow, heauinesse, astonishment, horror: he being Lord of all, yet seruant to all, most bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, yet made a curse for sinners. This was foretolde in Psalme 69. 9. which to bee well fitted to Christ, appeareth by comparing this text with Iohn 2, 17. By rebukes or blasphemies are meant not onely reprochfull words cast vpon God, which no lesse greeued Christ then if they had beene laid vpon himselfe, his Fathers contumelies were as greeuous to him as his owne: but by a Synecdoche of the part, one hainous sinne of blasphemy or reproch is put for all kinde of sinnes, which are so many contumelies, repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and ignominies against the maiesty of God: these all fell vpon Christ by the eternall decree of his Father, who so appointed it, 1. Peter 1, 20. and the voluntary obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Sonne so willing to haue it, so submitting to his Fathers pleasure and command, Phil. 2, 8. He had al the sinnes of all the elect in the world laide vpon him alone, that he as a common pledge and surety might beare them, and by bearing be made a propitiatory sacrifice to purge them, and satisfie Gods iustice for them, as it is written, Esay 53, 4, 5, 6, 7. The iniquities of vs all were laide on him, also Iohn 1, 29. This is the Lambe of God that taketh away the sinnes of the worlde, also Iohn 10, 15. Hee laide downe his life a ransome, 1. Pet. 2, 24. He bare our sinnes &amp;c. which is all one with our text, verse 3. The rebukes of thee sell on me.</p>

                     <p>That Christ in Scripture is set out not only as a redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but as an example of good life, as of beneficence, 2. Cor. 8, 9. Of forgiuing trespasses, Ephe. 4, 33. Of mutuall loue, Ephe. 5, 23. Of a free and constant confeision, 1 Ti. 6, 13. and 2. Tim. 2, 8. Of suffering the Crosse, Heb. 12, 2. Of fidelity in his function, Heb. 3, 2. Of meeknesse, 1. Pet. 2, 21. and 3, 18. Of lowlinesse, Phil. 2, 5. and in our texte

of patience and charity in bearing reproaches. Our Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son then hence is, that it is Christians duty to treade in the steps of their Sauiour Christ, and walke as hee gaue example, 1 Iohn 2, 5. For we are vn worthy to bee coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Christians, if we professe him in name, and bee not like him in workes. If he be our Lord indeede, like wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy seruants we must striue to do, as hee giues vs exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Iohn 13, 15.</p>

                     <p>This reprooues such as wil protest they beleeue in Christ, and are his seruants and followers, yet do not conforme their actions after his patterne, neuer thinking to liue as Christ liued; forgetting and neglecting such a perfect and noble president, to whome the more nearer men do come in holinesse and loue, more like they be to God, and neerer vnto perfection. Also, it condemnts such heretickes, as made of him but an exemplary Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, to giue vs example to liue so, as we may at last come to saluation. For he is so to vs a patterne, as hee is our Highpriest too: he suffered, and by his paines and death redeemed sinners, giuing himselfe a price, his bloode a ransome, to set free such as were vnder sinne, death, and Satan. By our Text it is plaine, that then hee became an expiation to cleanse our greatest sinne, euen our blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies (not lesser sinnes onely,) when hee also shewed foorth a worthy example of louing and patience, who being creator and King of glory, yet bare so much and heauy things, would teach vs (beeing his seruants and creatures) to beare a little, and some smaller matters in our neighbour. Let vs shame with our mouth to cal him Lord and our Redeemer, except we finde our hearts wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do as he hath done.

                     <p>This Text containeth first a secret obiection with the answere. The Obiection is thus: Yea, but the place in the Psalme, belongs to <hi>Dauid,</hi> or Christ, and not to vs. Vnto which hee aunswereth, that it is a bad conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. For it so concerneth them, as it was deliuered to writing for our learning also. Secondly, a petition vnto God for vnity or agreement in doctrine and wils, verses 5, 6. Thirdly, the first exhortation in verse 1. is rehearsed with the two Arguments from Christs example, verse 7. which example is applied first to the Iewes, verse 8. then to the Gentiles, verse 9, 10, &amp;c. whose vocation is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by many Oracles of Scripture, vnto verse 13.</p>

                     <p>The Books of the old Testament, <hi>Moses,</hi> Psalmes and Prophets. The vses to which they were ordayned, are particularly many, but generally two. First, doctrine or learning, which is the foundation or roote, whereon the other fruites do rest and grow. Secondly, life or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of manners, as (patience) by which Christians in their warfare and wrestling against their enemies, are armed and enabled to endure without being broken in minde, or fainting through euils.</p>
                     <p>The next is Consolation, which stayeth their mind in the full confidence of Gods assistance, and a good issue. Thirdly, Hope, which is an expectation of heauenly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. There be other ends of Scripture, as to work all gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to reprooue, to exhort, to conuict: but these be the cheefe named heere, to confirme men in faith, patience,
<pb n="1202" facs="tcp:20835:599"/>
and hope of eternall life. Now because the Scripture as an instrument workes these guifts, therefore heere they be called patience, comfort, and hope of the Scriptures, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching them and causing them: To which purposes forso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the new Testament serueth as well as the old, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all inspired by one Spirite, therefore the Apostoticall writing howsoeuer not then extant, yet this sen tence rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vnto them also.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, we learne that there is nothing in the whole Scripture idle or superfluously written, but the whole and euery part hath fruite and edification in it, not onely to such as liued vnder the old Testament, but to such as liue in the Church in all ages; neyther onely is it written for the profite of Nouices, (as some hereticks auouch,) but of the most perfect: all men one and others may learne from thence, and be the better for it. The reason is, because the<note place="margin">Reason.</note> counsell of the most wise God, his treasures of knowledge are opened therein, so far as concernes mans saluation. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so it was ordained and inspired for the profite of the whole Church, 2. Tim. 3, 17. Euery sentence of Scripture hath in it matter of some profitable instruction.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>To what vse serueth this first instruction?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, it serueth to distinguish these sacred books from all other which haue some vanity, superfluity, or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity in them, something to be cut off as needlesse. And againe, though they teach other behouefull and lawfull knowledge and sciences, yet helpe not to instruct vnto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; whereas the Scriptures haue nothing which may be reiected, but is all necessary and wholesome, informing men sufficiently in things of eternall life, Iohn 20, 31. 2. Tim. 3, 13.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it checks the arrogancy of such as helde the olde Testament to haue onely temporall promises, and of the <hi>Manichees</hi> which reiect the old Testament as vaine and vnpertinent to vs: likewise the <hi>Saduces</hi> which admitted onely <hi>Moses</hi> bookes: likewise of <hi>Libertines,</hi> which sticke
<pb n="1203" facs="tcp:20835:599"/>
to certaine pretended reuelations, despising Scripture as written for nouices and weake ones. And of the Papists, whoe affirme that there was an higher doctrine (then the Scripture hath any) to feed perfect ones, (their Church traditions forsooth:) whereas the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> putteth himselfe in the number of such as may learne from the Schoole-Maister (the Holy-Ghost) who indited the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, though he had beene rapt into the third heauens. Thirdly, it reproues such prophane persons, which eyther reade not at all, or else reade Scriptures to passe away time, as they reade Liuy or Chronicles for story, without consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of further sruite thereby to be gotten.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, it exhorts all Christians to reade them with this minde, to bee edified, asking still of themselues, what may I learne by this, or how doth this appertaine to me; oh that euery one would doe it. It were greatly to be wished that as God hath giuen his written word for spirituall soule in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and comfort, so euery one would study, reade, heare, and preach them with this sincere heart to see and obserue what makes for the making of them wiser or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For certaine it is, that such haue the kindly and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vse of Scriptures, as turne euery branch of it to the furthering of them in godlinesse and doctrine, or in good life and manners. The end of Scripture is practise as well as doctrine, we reade and heare to learne, and wee learne to know, and we know, to the end to liue thereafter. Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke knowledge is the very marke and end of Philosophy which wold haue speculation to end in action; much more it would be so in diuinity, where blessednesse is promised (not for doing) but to dooers. More especially, let Gods messengers which are to teach scriptures to others, be here warned, that their part is in handling Scripture, (if they wil be free from the grossest sacriledge) not to conuert the Scriptures to serue vnto vaine glory, ambition, worldly preferments, carnall ostentation, placing eyther them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues or other men, (a thing too common, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon (that is vncleane) euen a great and horrible pollution
<pb n="1204" facs="tcp:20835:600"/>
of the sacred word, to accommodate it to such prophane purposes) but to the edifying of the hearers in faith and piety, to that end denying themselues, and deliuering the word in that simplicity in which it was left vs by the holy Ghost.</p>

                     <p>The difference betweene the patience, comfort, and hope of the Heathens, Papists, Worldlings, and true Christians, who haue these graces from the Doctrine and faith of Scriptures, which is the mother and Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of them. Christians therefore be patient, comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and hopefull, because they beleeue the doctrine, which teacheth God to be the author of afflictions, (not fortune or the will of men:) and that as the causes be iust and equall to correct, humble, &amp; mortifie his Children, so the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Whereas all vnbeleeuers, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer shewe of these graces they make, yet they are but meere shadowes, hauing (for the ground of patience,) their owne naturall reason and carnall respects. But of these 3. graces, and the generall vse of Scriptures, reade more on the Dialogue on Ro. 4, 23. &amp; 5, 3, 4, 5, 6.</p>

In the last words of this seauenth verse, lieth an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment perswasorie from the more vnto the lesse, thus; If Christ receiued vs vnto the glory of his Father (euen to make vs partakers of so great a benefite as of glorie and immortality in heauen) with his Father: (this is the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sence then to say, that Christ either propounded his Fathers glorie as his end whereby he receiued vs, or that wee should receiue one another for the glorisying of God: which both are true, but not so fit as this, that hee did loue vs so far, as to make vs partakers of his Fathers glory) therefore it followes, that much more we should receiue one another to peace and concord; which is the fruite of our receiuing to the benefite of his: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he did such things to enemies, how should not we be ready (if wee will approoue our selues good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) to receiue friends and Brethren?</p>

                     <p>First we haue a singular example of rare humility in Christ, who beeing the Sonne of God equall to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet by taking our nature, subiecting himselfe to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision and the whole lawe, by his diligent teaching, miracle-working, his passion painefull and reprochfull, his resurrection victorious, did minister vnto the Iewes his enemies: being made their seruant whose Lord hee was, yet seruant to all being Lord of all. Which should admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish vs of his loue to mankinde, for whose loue and sake he was so abased, comming not to bee ministred vnto, but to minister: so of our dutye in bearing the same minde as he did, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> no seruice how seruile or abiect soeuer, to expresse zeale to God or our brethren, Phil. 2, 5, 6, 7. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Christ may be a patterne as of low linesse to all, so of diligence and fidelity to Ministers of the word, whose dignity stands not in titles, solemnities, Robes, pompes, processions, papall massing, &amp;c. but in teaching the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple constantly and soundly; also in feruent prayer for them, and example of an holy blamelesse life: for thus Christ in his owne person ministred to the Iewes and afterwards to the Gentiles by his Apostles.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, heere is a proofe of that glorious property of God, (to wit) his truth, that hee is most true and faithfull of his word, namely because such promises as vpon the fal he made to <hi>Adam</hi> touching the womans seede, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the Patriarkes, concerning the same to come out of their loynes, to make all Nations blessed, were in due time accomplished by sending Christ, borne of a pure vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, to be a common Sauiour of elect Iewes and Gentiles. Let this moue all Christians to put confidence in him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so mercifull and true who will not deceiue. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to imitate his properties, beeing faithful in their words,
<pb n="1208" facs="tcp:20835:602"/>
bargaines, couenants, vowes, and promises. Thirdly, to praise and magnifie him for his free and gracious calling of vs Gentiles to the grace of Christ; whereof vnlesse hee had made vs truely partakers, we could neyther celebrate and confesse him, as it was sorespoken of by <hi>Dauid,</hi> Psal. 10, 50. 2. Sam. 22. Neyther reioyce together with his owne nation the Iewes, called by the Gospell, as was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saide, Deut. 32, 45. Nor haue praised God as we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, Psal. 117. 1. Nor haue hoped or put our trust in him, as Esay 11, 10. except hee had become our Sauiour and redeemer: To whom therefore for his vnspeakeable mercies in visiting the Gentiles, and being their light, be all ioyfull praise and thankes in all the Churches of the Saints.</p>

                     <p>In the 13. verse <hi>Paul</hi> finisheth his exhortatory speech touching loue and concord amongst the Romanes with a short pithy prayer; wherein hee so declareth his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent desire of their saluation, as withall, hee insinuateth that neyther they could performe by any power of their owne what hee had moued them vnto, nor yet hee inable them to doe what he taught: But of all his instruction the successe depended wholy in Gods blessing and helpe; and therefore but requisite that Sermons and exhortations should begin &amp; end with prayer to God, as to assist speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and hearer to doe their duties well, so to make all pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous when they haue done. In seeking and suing to God alone, it so checks the inuocatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of creatures, as it teacheth
<pb n="1209" facs="tcp:20835:602"/>
the faithfull to resort to God alone for euery good guift. God alone doth both know and fulfill the desires of his children, and it is an honour peculiar to him to be trusted in and called on, Psal. 50, 15. The matter of his prayer is that wherein he saide, Chap. 14. ver. 17. <hi>That the kingdom of God stood:</hi> so now he prayeth not, That they might bee filled with meats and drinks, but with peace with God, in themselues, towards their Brethren; and ioy, that is, encrease of peace, euen spirituall gladnesse of the heart, freed from terrors of Gods wrath, and cheared with the sence of Gods loue in Christ, and hope of glory. [<hi>All Ioy</hi>] signifieth solid and firme ioy, such as lasteth; not like the vanishing ioy of worldlings, who reioyce in prosperity, and are sad, euen heauy to death in calamitie, as <hi>Ionas</hi> gourd grew in the day, and dyed in the night: but dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ioy which will not be taken away or quenched with the sharpest crosses. Of this peace and ioy, he noteth the true causes and the nearest (to wit) Faith, or the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of Faith, a sure grounde of all Christian peace and comfort; and Hope, which is a sure expectation of all good things needefull for vs, and namely of eternall life. Of which infallible expectation, the mercies and truth of the Father, the regeneration of the Spirite, the merites of the Sonne, be both the fountaine and props. Note further, that of these graces he sets downe the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est cause, the holy Ghost, by whose power (that is) migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty working, they are giuen and encreased vnto a great measure, which is heere expresly begged, [<hi>God fill you, &amp; that you may abound in all ioy.</hi>

                     <p>What is the Doctrine of this 14. verse thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted and analyzed?</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>The first is, that it is God alone in whom Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians<note place="margin">Doctrine.</note> are to fixe all their hope and trust: for he is called the God of Hope, not only with respect to the verse 12. or for that he is the author of Hope, engendring all liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hope, as he is tearmed God of patience, 1 Pet. 1, 3. but especially for that he is the obiect of hope, being hee in
<pb n="1210" facs="tcp:20835:603"/>
whom alone all hope is to be placed, and that for these Reasons. First, God not onely commands to trust in him alone, but threatneth a curse to such as haue hope &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance in men, 1 Tim. 6, 17. Ier. 17, 5. Secondly, examples of holy Patriarkes and Kings which hoped in God, and were not confounded but deliuered. Our Fathers tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in God, and were saued (saith <hi>Dauid.</hi>) Thirdly, God besides his mercies, fidelity, and omnipotency, hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit means to succour his which relie on him. Therefore let all men trust strongly in God, and renounce all other hopes, either Popish in their owne merits (a rotten post to trust in) or worldly, as in horses, friends, riches, &amp;c. which are but vaine thinges to saue a man, Ps. 20, 7.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That godly Christians must labour after the greatest measure of Faith, hope, peace, ioy, and other graces: neuer contenting themselues with any portion, till they be filled and do abound. The reason is, because<note place="margin">Reason.</note> such is Gods will, else <hi>Paul</hi> would not haue asked fulnes and aboundance of God. As couetous men neuer thinke they haue Gold enough, so let Gods childe neuer think he hath graces enough: for he is bound to waxe spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as plants and young children do naturally, and the more grace he hath the more and better seruice shall he do to his God. Also, it is a signe of sauing grace, when it growes and abounds.</p>

                     <p>First, it reprooues such as sweate and take paines<note place="margin">Vse.</note> to thriue in the world, but do not so to thriue in grace; Such also as rest in beginnings, and couet not perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Also such as go backwards and fall away. And enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth all Christians, by all good means of reading, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, hearing, prayer, &amp; conference, keeping a good conscience, by right vse of the Lords Supper, to labour after encrease in spirituall things.</p>

                        <hi>Paul</hi> passeth forwards to the conclusion of this Epistle, wherein first he praiseth them verse 14. and then defendeth his writing to them, verse 15. From his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of them, Ministers and others learne, that we are not alwayes to exhort and reprooue our hearers, there is a time for praises also; namely, when the parties vppon our knowledge deserue praise. Secondly, when the thing praised is excellent. Thirdly, if the persons be capeable, (to wit) such as will not be puffed vp thereby, but excited more to their dutie. Fourthly, when Gods praise is chiefely aymed at without base flattery, then it is wisedome to praise: for praise is a spurre in the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to piety, and witnesseth the charity of the prayser. Our Apostle might haue beene thought to haue beene sharpe, considering former and round admonitions, and somewhat suspitious of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> hauing so feruent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and often prayed for them, as if all had not been well, but farre amisse; but by his present praises, hee quickens them to godlines, and quitteth himselfe from sinister and vncharitable suspition, whose example is to be followed of Ministers and other Christians.</p>

                     <p>After he had louingly saluted them by name of Brethren, to intimate his owne loue, and inciteth theirs, and shewes that he spake not by hearesay or anie ydle report, but of a strong perswasion, grounded onely vpon the profession and effectes of their Faith, which was verie famous thoroughout the Christian worlde, Romanes 1, 8. then hee prayfeth them in three respects: First, because of their great goodnesse, [<hi>Full of Goodnesse,</hi>]
<pb n="1212" facs="tcp:20835:604"/>
that is, enriched with piety towards God and men, and namely, with mercy and kindnes towards the brethren. Secondly, their excellent faith and skilfulnesse in diuine things, wherein they had attained such a perfection (not absolute which had no want, for then they needed not mutuall admonition, but such as in this life may bee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained vnto in comparison of others:) they were perfect in knowledge [<hi>All knowledge,</hi>] but farre from that perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which is now, and shal be among the celestiall spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits at the last, 1 Cor. 13, 7, 8, &amp;c. The third part of their praise, is ability or gift to admonish each other, being as so many Monitors or masters, such as could see what was conuenient to bee done, (a wise mans part,) and put o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in minde of their duty.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That it is a dutie very praiseworthy in a Christian to be able and willing to giue admonition. The Reasons hereof are, first it declareth our obedience vnto God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring it, Leuit. 19, 17. 1 Thes. 5, 11. Secondly, our cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards the Bretheren which want admonition, whereby they are preserued from sinne and destruction, and wonne to righteousnesse and saluation if they hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and obey, Math. 18, 15. which made <hi>Dauid</hi> desirous to seeke it, Psal. 141, 5. Thirdly, it is one of the right and holye vses of our vnderstanding and wisedome in the word to apply it to the warning of others, as Col. 3, 16. Such then as cannot, or list not, or care not to admonish others, loose a speciall praise, bewraying want of the feare of God, and of loue to men: and such as do admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish, let them go forwards the more chearfully, the more commendable this duty is, which <hi>Paul</hi> had not so pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed but that it is much to be esteemed and exercised.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>That there be two graces behoouefull to them, who shall well discharge this duty of admonishing. The first is goodnesse, the second is knowledge: for without
<pb n="1213" facs="tcp:20835:604"/>
goodnesse or integrity of life our admonitions will bee of no force, whilst it may bee saide to vs, <hi>Physitian heale thy selfe,</hi> and, <hi>Hypocrite plucke the beame out of thy owne eye.</hi> Secondly, when a man himselfe is blameable, he cannot freely and boldly admonish another: see Rom. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, 21, 22. Thirdly, he that would haue hope of doing good in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proouing others, had neede to be vnreprooucable, else what hope hath hee that God will blesse his admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? The other grace required heereto, is a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of knowledge to guide vs to see and know where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to admonish; and when, and where, and whom, and by whom, our selues or others; and in what maner, out of loue and pitty, roughly or mildely, directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, openly or priuately, and to what end, &amp; how long till we haue hope, that we cast not pearles before Swine; and in what words, euen in the words of Scripture, for they haue most authority, and there is no exceptions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. To these purposes it is no meane wisedom will serue: therefore <hi>Paul</hi> requireth in such as shall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish their Brethren, that the word of God dwel rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in them in al (that is, much and manifold) wisedome, Col. 3, 16. And if to this one duty, such and so great skil be needful, then iudge what cause there is for Christians to search and study the Scriptures diligently and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, hauing so many other more waighty offices to do in their generall and particular callings.</p>

And vnto the admonished to take in good worth good warninges from their brethren, yea, although not alwayes giuen with such wisedome and loue as were meete: for God is not bound to set a discreete godlye person aworke to warne thee, not alwayes to send an <hi>Abigail,</hi> a <hi>Iethro, &amp;c.</hi> but sometime by a poore silly maide or man seruant, our Inferiours both in place, 2 Kinges 5, 3, 13.

Vpon these causes he had written, not (somewhat) that is, some thing, and left out others as necessary, by tradition of Church to be supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as the great Iesuit dreamed;) for the Scripture is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: but somewhat must goe with boldely, and then the meaning is, that with some liberty and freedome of wordes, befitting the grauity of the matter, and of my calling.

                     <p>Two: the first is, that boldnesse, admonitions &amp; reproofes become well Gods messengers. First for the commandement sake, Es. 58, 1. <hi>Cry aloud, spare not, tell &amp;c.</hi> Earnestnes and freedome of speech, is heere inioyned to Gods messengers. Secondly, a Messenger is not onely to do his Lords message, but in maner and forme as he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. Thirdly, if sin (like a strumpet) be bold to appear,
<pb n="1215" facs="tcp:20835:605"/>
why should not Gods Seruants be bold to controule it? Fourthly, there is great danger if we faile heerein, both to the sinner, Ezek. 3, 18, 19. and to the Minister, Ier. 1. 17. <hi>Speake to them, or I will destroy thee.</hi> It is true, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this, will cause such as loue and liue in the seruice of sinne, to account their reproouers enimies; as <hi>Achab</hi> did <hi>Elias,</hi> and the <hi>Galatians Paul;</hi> and obserue all his wayes narrowly, to see if they can haue any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion or aduantage to accuse or to hurt him: as those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces can testifie, where Ministers do with this holy liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty testifie against euils and sinnes: but better to haue all men our enemies, then to haue God alone to bee against vs; and if we cannot saue others, yet it standeth vs vpon to deliuer our owne soules.</p>
                     <p>The second Doctrine is, that Gods Ministers are Gods remembrancers, to put the people in minde. For men, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen the best, are forgotful, yea of common and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowne duties: by which meanes they run into great euils. Did not <hi>Dauid</hi> in his fury against <hi>Naball,</hi> forgette that he ought not to kill or reuenge, till <hi>Abigail</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred him? And <hi>Peter</hi> in his feare forget Christes premo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition touching the thrice deniall of him, till a Cocke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened him? Howe easily then may others let slip out of memory necessary principles and instructions, sithens a godly Prophet and an Apostle did it? And therefore, if there were no other benefit to be reaped by the publike Ministery, neither for teaching our ignorance, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicting our errors, or informing vs in duties, or reproo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing our vices, or comforting our faint-heartednes, yet heerein were cause enough why to loue and vse assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies where the worde is preached, to haue our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances stirred vp. As <hi>Dauid</hi> blessed <hi>Abigail,</hi> for remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring him, and <hi>Peter</hi> wept when hee remembred his fall by the crowing of a bird: so it is euery ones duty to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and blesse God and his Ministers, for this office done to them.</p>

                     <p>Hauing maintained his bolde writing to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes by an argument drawne from his Apostolicall func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (which being graciously bestowed on him, as ver. 15. imposed vpon him a necessity to write freely and boldly to them, as beeing commanded of God so to doe towardes them, beeing a part of his charge:) Now in these present verses hee describeth and magnifieth his Ministry sundry wayes, to make it gracious and glorious to the Romanes and other beleeuers: and first it is set soorth by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of it; the author of it is God or Christ Iesus, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately and extraordinarily called him, Acts 9, 3, 4. to be his seruant, Gal. 1, 1. and his publike Minister: Not as Magistrates bee, Rom, 13, 6. but to minister the Gospell, where of God is the author; to giue attendance vnto holye things, and to worke in the holy seruice of the Gospell, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Gentiles, (<hi>as Peter</hi> was inioyned to do towards the Iewes. Which maketh much to the commendation of his function, that he enioyed it with a large commission, as to preach to all the Gentiles, and also to haue the [Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell] that is, the glad tidings of peace and good things to bee the subiect of his preaching, as the Gentiles were the obiect of it: but heerein especially his ministry was exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the elect faithfull Gentiles were as a sacrifice of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by him vnto God, and the Gospell as it were the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing knife, himselfe as an holy Priest to kill, to cleanse and to offer (not beasts) but faithfull men vnto God. And finally, the oblation or sacrificing to bee his preaching,
<pb n="1217" facs="tcp:20835:606"/>
doctrine, and admonitions, for the conuersion of soules thorow the Spirite, sanctifying and changing the hearts of the elect, among the heathen.</p>

                     <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
                     <p>What are wee to learne by this comparison or likenesse betweene the Ministery of the Gospell, and Leuiticall Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood?</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, it warnes vs of the great dignity of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, that it is sanctified &amp; consecrated vnto such an holy end as the conuersion of sinners; which as it is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test good, so the function which effecteth it must be of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular worthinesse: Let men honour it as they loue saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Secondly, hence we learne that God is much desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of, and greatly delighted with the saluation of men, for that hee doth account it for a very acceptable sacrifice or offering. Which should serue not a little to encourage both Preachers and professors with exceeding ioy of hart to trauaile, the one in preaching and setting it foorth; the other in hearing and receiuing the word of God, beeing imployed in such a seruice so pleasing to God, so profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to themselues.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, we are taught heere that as the Sacrifices of the law were then pleasing vnto God, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they were pure and offered vp according to rites of the law; so Christians doe become an acceptable sacrifice through the sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Holy-Ghost, working repentance from their sinnes, and induing them with a liuely faith, that beeing pure and bolye, they might please God through Christ. Though holinesse as a fruite of the Spirite doe please God, yet it is Christ the Mediator which maketh it, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in whom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap>, to be acceptable.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, from this 16. verse wee haue wherewith to stop the mouths of the Papists, &amp; prophane worldlings. As for the Papists which obiect vnto vs the want of Priest-hood, and seeme to lament that we haue no sacrifices, &amp;c. we say for our selues that we haue both in our Churches: for our Sermons are oblations, our people be sacrifices, our selues Priests, (not properly taken, for so they ceased in Christs
<pb n="1218" facs="tcp:20835:607"/>
person, beeing the onely proper Priest and sacrifice of the new Testament) but improper and metaphoricall, who yet truely and effectually doe by the sword of the worde slay mens brutish sinnes, to make them a sanctified hoast to God. Rather we haue iust cause to lament their case, that hauing thrust out this kinde of sacrifycing by the doctrine, and preaching of the holye Scriptures, warranted by the authority of God himselfe; they wickedly vsurpe in their Masse, to sacrifice Christ properly euery day, after his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample at his last supper, wherin yet he made no oblation: &amp; thus of being the Ministers of Christ, they proue the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers of Christ, and the successors of <hi>Iudas,</hi> rather then the imitators of <hi>Paul.</hi> Now touching the prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons which mislike and murmure at the plaine and bolde admonitions of the Ministers: Let this satisfie such, that as neuer any did finde fault with the Sacrificers of the lawe for killing and dressing of beasts appointed to bee sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, so it should bee imputed as no blame to Preachers by the sacrificing knife of the worde, to slay &amp; mortifie mens brutish lusts and vices: which if they be suffered to liue and raigne, it cannot be we should be an holy and acceptable sacrifice to God, Rom. 12, 1, 2.</p>

                     <p>Hee continueth to commend his Apostolicall function by the effects, in the subduing of the Gentiles by his ministry vnto the obedience of the Gospell, both by his words and workes, verse 18. whereof hee reckoneth first the kindes, (signes and wonders) and the efficient cause, the power of the Holy-Ghost, the author of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, verse 19. And for so much as the Romanes might ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, Why doest thou O <hi>Paul</hi> chiefely begin with vs Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, and so earnestly deale with vs, passing by other nations? Thereunto hee answereth, verse 19, 20. that he had spread the Gospell by his preaching in many other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, yea where the name of Christ had not sounded, or beene knowne before; whereof hee noteth the ende in
<pb n="1219" facs="tcp:20835:607"/>
verse 20. Least I should builde on another mans founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in verse 21. he sheweth his warrant and commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion out of the Prophet Esay, Chap. 52. verse 15. In regard of these things he doth professe that he had occasion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing and matter of glorying, yet not in himselfe but in Christ and his grace, (in which alone there is true glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God) and not in honour, riches, and wisedome of the world, but in the things pertaining to God, (to wit) in matters concerning the worshippe of God, and the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the Church, wherein his ministry did consist, verse 17.</p>

                     <p>What especiall doctrines can ye obserue from the verse 17. to the 21. verse, whereof the method and meaning you haue now breefely vnfolded?</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Out of verse 17. we haue these instructions: First when God prospereth the worke of our vocation, (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by blessing the ministry to the working of faith and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to Christ) therein is iust cause of reioycing. The reason is, because in such effects God is highly glorified in his mercies, and soules conuerted and saued, whereat men and Angels ought to bee glad, Luke 15, 7. Such therfore wrong God and his Church much, which neyther them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues labour to winne men to Christ, and doe enuy others which doe it. Also heere is more cause of incouragement &amp; ioy by the happy successe of his ministry to a Preacher, then of disheartning by the vnthankfulnesse of the world. Lastly, it reproueth such as by disobedience and vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse, do grieue their Ministers, whose heauinesse is the peoples vnhappinesse. Heb. 13, 17. Secondly, wee learne that Ministers in their reioycing must retaine this mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, as not to be puffed vp with their guifts, or to despise o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whom God doth not so grace and blesse, but euer to remember they are but Organes &amp; instruments of Christ, to effect what he will doe by them, 1. Cor. 4, 1. All the force working in the conscience is of Christ, who both or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the Ministers, and furnished them with guifts and zeale, and blesseth their indeuours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="1220" facs="tcp:20835:608"/>The third instruction is, that the subiect of their ministry be (the things of God,) that is, his seruice, Heb. 5, 1. A Minister is a middle person betweene the people and God, to report Gods will to them, and to offer and vtter their prayers to God, to preach from God glad tydings of peace and good things; and on the other side to bring the people to God. <hi>Wee will attend the worde and Prayer,</hi> Acts 6, ver. 4. Ministers bee the mouth of GOD to open his minde, and of the peoples to put vp their request: thus their seruice is wholly about the soule.</p>
                     <p>The reason is, that as Christs kingdome is not of this world, so his Ministers are ouer the people in things not belonging to this world, but to the Lord, 1 Thess. 5, 12. Hence is a iust reproofe to such, as neglecting to imploy themselues in the things of God (which are the things proper to their calling) doe spend it in following theyr carnall pleasures, or worldly profit, doing nothing lesse, then that whereunto they be of God ordained and elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his Church, whose end will be fearefull, by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable of the euill seruaunt in the Gospell, which in his Maisters absence, gaue himselfe to sensuality, and forgot his proper seruice.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>First, whereas <hi>Paul</hi> made a religion and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as one that neither would nor could speak of ought [<hi>I dare not,</hi>] which Christ had not wrought in him, and done by him in the function of his Apostleship: Hence wee learne, as the duty of Pastors, to acknowledge the whole fruite of their ministry to come from Christ as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. <hi>Paul</hi> which planteth is nothing, but Christ which giueth the encrease: so the deity of Christ, that he is true and very God, whose sole and onely worke it is to make the preaching effectuall, to bow mens hearts (naturallie stony and obstinate) to becom pliable to the doctrine of the Gospell to receiue it by faith, which is the chiefest obedience, and mother of al obedience inpractise &amp; con uersation; but Christ did this by the Ministry of <hi>Paul,</hi> as
<pb n="1221" facs="tcp:20835:608"/>
heere he confesseth. Therefore, he is the true and mighty God which changeth the hearts, yea, euen of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, peruerse Idolaters, and wholly estranged from God and goodnesse. To make these by faith and obedience to embrace the Gospell, must needes argue in Christ which did it, an omnipotency and diuine vertue. For to giue a new heart and a new Spirit, is Gods prerogatiue royall, Ezek. 36, 26.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, inasmuch as Christ wrought in <hi>Paul</hi> by two meanes (<hi>words</hi>) that is, publique preachings, priuate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, disputing, Epistles, and writings: and second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (<hi>deeds</hi>) that is, his great labour and trauaile, his godlie life, his many and manifold myracles, 1 Cor. 15, 10. it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foords this Doctrine; That there be two notable signes and markes of a faithfull Minister of Christ, and two es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peciall meanes whereby hee may benefite the flocke of Christ. First Doctrine, that he be able in a good measure to teach truths, and to confute the gainsayer. Titus 1, 9. Secondly, examples of life and maners to shine as a light, Math. 5. as Christ both saide and did, Acts 1, 1.</p>
                     <p>Farre hence from this calling bee all such, which are giuen to their ease and commodity, be either scandalous in life, or vnable and vnwilling to teach and labor in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine &amp; doing good. Let such know as haue their toong or hand lame and maimed, and bee defectiue in wordes or deeds, that they are so much short of that they ought to be. Also let such people see, that they haue God come so much the nearer to them, and haue the more meanes to draw neere to him, or to bee left without all excuse, whosoeuer enioy teaching and working Pastors, which builde with both hands. Some alleadge for defence of their ignorance ot wickednesse that their Minister is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and teacheth them not. Others, that their guides, though seeing ones, yet offensiue ones, say and do not: but such haue no exception at al to make, whose Pastors speake and worke, and giue light by sound doctrine and godly life.</p>

                     <p>That in the beginning of the Gospell, when the Doctrine thereof was yet newe, vnwoonted, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, and the Church yet being as a tender plant, or as a childe in the Cradle, it pleased God to accompanie the publishing of his trueth, with the gift of woorking myracles, the better to countenance and confirme both doctrine and the Church, Marke 16, 20. These Tokens and wonders which at the first did ratifie the Doctrine, (as seales establish couenants) are stil to this day of force to giue credite to the same doctrine (taught now in the reformed Churches) to be diuine and from heauen. So as he which without a myracle will not now beleeue it, (when all the world beleeueth it) he himselfe may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted a wonder.

Let vs rather suspect the Popish religion to bee the new Religion, and their Church no Church of Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they build the truth and credit thereof vpon won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which are no perpetuall nor effentiall notes of true Prophets, and true Church, but common to all Prophets both false and true. See Deut. 13, 1, 2. Mat. 24, 24. 2 Thes. 2, 9. and Reuel. 13, 13. False Prophets, false Christs, yea, that Antichrist shall be permitted (for the probation of the faithfull, and perdition of the vnfaithfull) to worke wondrous workes, which are called lying wonders, 2. Thess. 2, 9. both because they be many of them but iug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling trickes, packed by the cunning of Friars, and for that they tend (suppose they should be done) to deceiue men, to establish their lyes, superstitions, and heresies of Popery: also, because oftentimes they are done or do proceede from Satan the Father of lies. Whereas, all true myracles (as our Text teacheth) for their end doth serue to confirme the truth of the Gospell: and for their beginning, they alwaies be wrought by the mighty Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, who alone can alter the course of nature, and do wondrous things. Satan and his imps do some things to be wondred at of such as cannot perceiue the causes of those things which impostures cunningly hide.</p>
                     <p>But if that miracles were necessary, we are not vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destitute. The straunge proseruation of <hi>Luther</hi> and Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> against many deadly enemies, is maruailous if not myraculous: also the discouering of the Gun-pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Treason, in so strange a sort. Maister <hi>Hawks</hi> clapping his hands thrice for ioy in the fiery flame: <hi>Cranmers</hi> hart whole in the fire, his body being burnt, as it hapned to others, are not these wondrous matters?</p>

                     <p>It commends to vs these few instructions. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as <hi>Paul</hi> had filled with the Gospell (that is, had brought
<pb n="1224" facs="tcp:20835:610"/>
to the faith of Christ by plentifull and diligent preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gospell) so many people and prouinces as were mightily distant one from the other, as <hi>I Hyricum</hi> (which is thought to be that which at this day we call <hi>Slauonia</hi>) is distant from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> the <hi>Metropolis</hi> of <hi>Iudea,</hi> which in a right line is iudged to be about 350. <hi>Germain</hi> miles, but was much larger space going by circuites, and fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing compasses, as it is knowne he did. In this example of the Apostle (I say) carying the word to such Barbarians, and superstitious places, with such extreame labour, and both manifest and manifold dangers (whereof we reade in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and in 2 Cor. 11.) wee haue the Image of a faithfull Minister, filled with loue of Christ his Kingdom and mans saluation, to the reproofe of such as with farre lesse paines, and no perrill at home, may and ought to preach Christ euery Saboth, and will not: and it giueth due encouragement to all such as do the Lordes worke with fidelity and industry, to perseuer in theyr godlie course, whereof they haue <hi>Paul</hi> such a noble president &amp; patterne. As God will looke for much of them to whom he committeth much; so they which doe improoue their Talents, and encrease them vntill they come to be tenne Talents, such shall be set ouer ten Cities, and enter into their Maisters ioy, when the sloathfull shall heare, <hi>Take him, and binde him, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Furthermore as <hi>Paul</hi> in few words ran ouer an heap of Myracles, and an infinite company of Cities, in ver. 19 to set forth his infinite labours to the example of others; so in that he studied, and did euen in an holy ambition (as men striue which be greedy of worldly honour) contend to fulfil the prophesies, concerning the carying the name and Gospell of Christ, where it had neuer beene preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any before him, yea, where the sound of Christ ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer came. Heerein first he did approue himselfe a true A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, whose office was, to call ignorant heathnish peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to Christ, and to constitute Churches, which they might leaue to others to builde forwarde, as <hi>Paul</hi> did in
<pb n="1225" facs="tcp:20835:610"/>
                        <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Creta,</hi> 1. Timothy 1, 34. Titus 1, 4, 5, 6.</p>
                     <p>Faire vnlike to that which Iesuites boast to bee done by them in <hi>India;</hi> for neyther bee they commissionated for the whole world, as the Apostles were, neyther preached they the truth of the Gospell, but their owne errors, the traditions of <hi>Rome:</hi> and gathered Churches not to Christ, but to Antichrist, to increase not Gods but Sathans king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, making them an hundred times worse then they were before, yea by their extreame cruelties making the name of Christ odious to those Pagans.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in that <hi>Paul</hi> sought as well to instruct such as were conuerted, as to gaine to Christ such as were stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from him, we see againe his affection to Christs glory and kingdome; which should bee a spur in the sides of all Christs true Ministers to quicken them to al care and labor for the enlarging of Christs flocke, and getting to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues testimony of their calling from God, by the zeale of their hearts, and fruites of their indeuour; as <hi>Paul</hi> had from the accomplishment of propheticall Oracles, whereby his extraordinary Apostolicall function was warranted to him selfe and the Churches of Christ.</p>

                        </gap> of this verse. I collect, that the Romanes were called to the faith and prosession of Christ, not long after the ascension of Christ: for the 20. yeare after it, did <hi>Paul</hi> write this Epistle, but hee had a desire of seeing the Romanes, many yeares before he wrote vnto them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many yeares before they were conuerted; not by <hi>Peter</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> affirmes, of whose being at <hi>Rome</hi> al the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned doe doubt, nor by <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ioyntly, as others thinke, but rather by the preaching of <hi>Barnabas</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, as <hi>Clement reporteth.</hi>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Whereas <hi>Paul</hi> writes that hee trusteth to see them in his iourney into <hi>Spaine,</hi> we gather that this iourny was
<pb n="1227" facs="tcp:20835:611"/>
not directed by speciall impulsion and motion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, (as sometimes it was done, Acts 16.) but by humane purpose; therefore he saith (I trust) and indeed wee reade not in sacred writ that euer hee came at <hi>Spaine:</hi> for this place which onely mentioned his minde heerein, giueth vs no light of a certaine iudgement. Hee speakes onely of a purpose, not of a performance: <hi>Paul</hi> doubtlesse meant it, yet with reuerence to Gods will, which so ouer-ruleth the euents of mens intentions, as in a speciall manner he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned the Apostles in their administration.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we learne that for future things which be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent, we are to depend vpon Gods good will and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence, without all rash and peremptory presumption. We are obliged not onely in the iudgement and purpose of our soule, to referre all to his most wise and iust disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to signifie the same with the words of our mouth, saying, I trust to do this or that, I trust to haue such a thing, &amp;c. Thirdly, it is a good fruite of loue &amp; reuerence, which we owe vnto the Ministers of Christ, (which are true and faithfull) to bee their companions of their iourney, to set them forwards on their way, namely when they are to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile through vnknowne and dangerous wayes: if the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple must lay downe their necks, much more tread three or foure steps for their Ministers. Howbeit, it is like <hi>Paul</hi> expected this kindnesse from the Romanes, not so much for his owne conduction and safety, as to impart holy and whole some things to such as went along in his company, which they might communicate at their returne to their brethren at <hi>Rome,</hi> for the greater benefite of the Church: which should aduertise teachers to take all occasions of profiting their people, and to conuert receiued kindnesses to their good which shew and do them.</p>

                     <p>It affoords vs these two instructions: First, hee calleth the poore (not any kinde or speciall sort, as such which had forsaken all for Christ,) but generally such Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers as were afflicted with want, and liued in worldly necessity, these he calleth [Saints] because they were such by profession.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="1228" facs="tcp:20835:612"/>Secondly, by the Sacrament of holinesse; to wit, Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, which dedicated them (as holy) to Christ. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by sanctification of the Spirite, purging their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences by the bloud of Christ, and renuing their hearts to sanctimony and godly purenesse by his Spirit: Al, rich and poore which beleeue in Christ, bee Saints while they liue in earth, and must minde and practise sanctity as euer they will see heauen.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that it is a good and holy duty to minister &amp; be helpefull to such poore Saints, eyther in giuing, collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or carrying almes to the godly poore, which are euer to be releeued, and with our best affections, Gal. 6, 10. The honest and holye poore which follow godlineste and their vocation, haue most interest in our mercy.</p>

                     <p>Seeing the Grecian Churches (such as were plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Acbaia</hi>) did succour the needy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> we ought by this example to extend our charity, (when ability suffereth) beyond the seas to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine Churches, when they neede vs; as our English Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches haue often and liberally done both to diuers afflicted Grecians, and chiefely to the Saints at <hi>Geneua,</hi> beeing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted and distressed through warres betweene them and <hi>Sauoy.</hi> The reason is, the straight coniunction which is betweene the faithfull (as betweene brethren, fellowes, members, coheires, &amp;c.) which no difference of language, no distance of place can dissolue; such then straighten their charity too much, which restraine it to their owne parish or nation, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Againe learne, that contributions must not bee extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and compulsions as comming of necessity or for any by or sinister respects, but voluntary oblations, (it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them) they gaue because they would, they were not forced, see Acts 11, 29, 30. 2. Cor. 9, 5. and 8, 9. To giue because we are asked, or for that they would not be held niggards, or out of feare of danger if we deny a stout beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or onely to discharge sesse, may profite receiuers, but
<pb n="1229" facs="tcp:20835:612"/>
doth not benefite the giuer, who hath no fruite of his gift except it come of beneuolence and good will.</p>

                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>These things: First, it behooueth to returne thankfulnesse where wee receiue a benefite: for a good turne hath the force of an obligation, and bindeth to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence; debters they were to the Iewes by the law of charity and equity, it is verye equall that few and small things be repaide for great, and many kindnesses tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall for spirituall things, their goods for the Gospell, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to their bodies from whome our soules receiue food of eternall life. This insinuated to the Romanes, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inriched as much as the Grecians, &amp; indebted no lesse to the Iewes, from whome they receiued the doctrine of Christ by the Apostles; therefore they ought to follow the example of <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Achaia,</hi> of whom <hi>Paul</hi> witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, 2. Cor. 8, 1. 2. 3. that their extreame pouerty aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to their rich liberality, beeing willing, euen aboue their power; so as the Romanes being better able, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like ingaged, (the Gospell also comming to them from Sion) it behoued them at least to be as francke as the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians of <hi>Macedonia</hi> were: of such a matter <hi>Paul</hi> very arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially and wisely doth here aduertise them, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends this duty in others, hee doth excite them vnto it.</p>
                  </sp>

                     <p>The verses 28, 29. are yet behind, will not this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine also send out some sweete streame?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Silas.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, as namely first that almes or workes of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy be likened to [fruite] for they are the fruites of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, Gala. 5. they spring from faith and charity; also they do please God, as pleasant fruite doth our palate. Thirdly, a fruite, because almes was profitable both vnto the giuer, as witnesses of their profession, and to the receiuer, whose necessities are relieued &amp; bowels comforted; yea to God himselfe, who reaped therby the fruite and calues of mens lips.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, commodious to others for example sake: Let al Christians heereby take more encouragement to abound
<pb n="1230" facs="tcp:20835:613"/>
in this fruite, which is so delightfull to God as an odour of sweete smell, and so very and manifoldly beneficiall to themselues which are bountifull giuers, by increasing euen their earthly store. Giue and it shall be giuen abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly, good measure pressed downe shall men giue into your bosome, Luke 6, 38. Because rich men beleeue not this, therefore they are eyther illiberall and handfast, spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring too much; or prodigall and wastefull, spending too much, chusing the one to fill their chests, and the other their lusts, rather then to be fruitefull in workes of charity, publike and priuate.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, note heere <hi>Pauls</hi> fidelity, that as a treasure signed &amp; shut vp in a close place, or as letters sealed, which others may not looke in and reade: so he was carefull that this almes might safely come to their hands, to whome it was meant, therefore would not commit and turne ouer the care to others, but himselfe would performe, (that is) discharge the trust placed in him. This it is which is meant when he saith, [<hi>when I haue sealed this fruite.</hi>] Such as deale falsly or fradulently in Orphanes goods, or almes giuen to the poore, or in reuenues of Hospitals, are condemned by this example of <hi>Paul,</hi> which calleth vpon all which haue trust reposed in them to declare all good faithfulnesse: the want whereof hindereth mercy, and makes loue of many to bee cold, who dare not exercise liberality because there is so little fidelity. Woe be to them by whom such offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces come; repent or perish.</p>
                     <p>Finally, whereas <hi>Paul</hi> promiseth to bring with him an abundant blessing of the Gospel, (that is, the Gospell which abundantly publisheth the eternall and most free grace of God in Christ, by whom all nations are blessed, through faith in him) he doth herein like affectionate parents, which going afarre off into strange countries, doe kindle in their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a longing desire of their returne, by large promises of some special gift at their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming againe: so the Apostle doth quicken the desires of the Romanes after his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
<pb n="1231" facs="tcp:20835:613"/>
with promise of the greatest good which he could bring, such as was able to make them partakers of all Gods spirituall blessings, and of blessednes euerlasting. Of this he was sure [<hi>I know it,</hi>] because he had it by reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, Acts 19, 21. After <hi>Pauls</hi> example, let preachers much rather seeke to do, then to receiue good in places where they come or trauel, it being a more blessed thing to giue, then to receiue, Acts 20, 35. How is the spirit of <hi>Paul</hi> differing from the spirit of Romish prelacie, whose comming is more pompous and chargeable then profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and commodious to others? Let godly Pastors also imitate his godly wisedome, in stirring vp and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the good wil of their flockes towards them, deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in their loue, and prouoking them to loue, purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, promising, and perfourming whatsoeuer may tend to make their people truely, and for euer blessed, though (if need be) with their labour and losse of liberty, liuing, and life. So Christ, so the Prophets, and so Apostles haue walked.</p>

all good, the protector against all euill, verse 31. Then in verse 32. the subiect of their prayer, or things to be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for on <hi>Pauls</hi> behalfe are two: First, to be set free from the vnbeleeuing and cruell Iewes which maligned <hi>Paul</hi> most of all other Apostles and disciples of Christ.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, that the poore Church of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> might as thankfully accept the almes brought them by him, as it was freely and voluntarily giuen them. Afterwards he notcth the effects and fruits of their mutual praiers; one was, that he might come to them, being saued from the fury of enemies; and the other, that he might come with more gladnes, if he vnderstood his seruice for the poore Brethren to be accepted, otherwise his comming would be with griefe, verse 32, 33.</p>

                     <p>The first Doctrine out of the 30. verse is, that the stronger do neede the praiers of the weaker. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because there will be still somewhat wanting to the best, and the force of prayers depends not vpon the worthinesse of persons (for the <hi>Romanes</hi> were lesse wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy then <hi>Paul</hi>) but on Christes merites, in whose name whosoeuer come to God, shalbe heard for themselues &amp; other. For that God which commands vs to pray for our selues, enioyneth vs to pray for others: especiallie, our teachers, as hauing more neede vnto, and more right in our prayers, then other Christians haue.</p>
                     <p>The Vse is to warne the weaker to shew their charitie in praying for the worthier, and the worthiest their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility in seeking the request of the meanest. How much more ought the infirme to desire earnestly the helpe of the zcalous prayers of the strong, when the strongest, such as <hi>Paul,</hi> dooth craue the weaker sort to remember him. Secondly, Gods prouidence which is first and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne cause, and mens prayers which are second cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, be not repugnant but subordinate; the one destroies not the other, but they mutually require one the other.
<pb n="1233" facs="tcp:20835:614"/>
                        <hi>Paul</hi> was sure to come to <hi>Rome</hi> by Gods power, yet hee neglecteth not the meanes, hee prayeth, and entreateth them to pray for him: see <hi>Acts</hi> 23, 32. <hi>Math.</hi> 7, 7, 8. The reason is, because God hath ordained prayer and other meanes, with a commandement to vse them: also hee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to serue his prouidence by meanes, though he bee free and vntied to any meanes, yea, euen when he setteth Instruments aworke, yet he doth all, because he wil: for he is a most free agent.</p>
                     <p>This checkes such as foreslow prayer and other helpes as neede requireth, and as God offreth them; they are in his obedience and feare to be vsed, least he be tempted. When a certaine Pastor had saide to a great Warriour, going to battaile, that hee would pray for him; who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied that it should not need, because if God meant him victory, it should come without his prayers; to whome the Preacher replied, Then also cast away your weapons and Soldiers, for without them (if he will) God can saue. So he saw his error.</p>
                     <p>Likewise, a certaine Physitian hauing a Patient who was an Atheist, told him, his Physicke would not worke without prayer to God, and so cured both his atheisine and sicknesse at once. Thirdly, Christian prayer must be feruent, cold suters be ill speeders, Iames 5, 16. Of zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous prayers, Poperie can giue no examples, because their prayers be vttered in a strange tongue: they labor with their lips, not with their mindes.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, feruent prayer of the faithfull, is as a strife or conflict, wherein sundry ioyne their forces against a common enemy. In worldly combats, as souldiers mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally beseech the aide one of another, so the faithfull by <hi>Pauls</hi> example, are to incite one to ioyne with another, and to conflict or fight together by prayers: for this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie hath many and great hinderances: as namely Sathan, because it doth him much hurt, hee suggesteth into the mindes of men at their prayers, thoughts of doubting, of wrath, reasonings, vaine immaginations, strange cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
<pb n="1234" facs="tcp:20835:615"/>
so as it is a verie difficult thing in time of inuocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to haue the whole heart fixed and stayed on God, and on the things which are payed for. This thing nedeeth an holy strife and contention: Most men do not account it thus: which causeth faigned and fainting prayers to proceede from many, such as vanish and fall to nothing ere they come a quarter of the way to heauen, whither they cannot reach without a spirituall violence. Fiftly, no better buckler in extreamity then prayer, feruent and faithfull. The Apostle being in great danger of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen the Iewes, craues not the <hi>Romanes</hi> to bring forth their weapons (as swords and Speares, &amp;c.) to encounter them and rescue him, but to fight with God by heartie prayer for his safety, wherein lyeth more security then in force of armes, by how much Gods power exceedeth all earthly might. Our degenerate and new <hi>Romanes</hi> take a readier way and shorter cut to quit them of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (not by running so farre as heauen,) but by sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, rebellions, murthers, treasons, stabbing of Princes, blowing vp of English Parliament-houses, and such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther monstrous vnnaturall courses, whereof godly <hi>Paul</hi> neuer once dreamed, vnlesse it were to denounce hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torment, and heauens losse to them. Oh how vnlike bee the spirit of <hi>Paul</hi> and of the Pope, who dares not trust God by prayer to flye to him onely, but to impious, dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical, and hellish practises and policies, to effect his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed will against such as hee accounts his foes, yet in truth Christs friends? How far be they from Antichrist, which delight so in the blood of Gods people, in barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous sauage cruelty, such as amongst <hi>Scythians</hi> &amp; Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibals is not to be heard of? <hi>Doeg</hi> is condemned for tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting in riches, <hi>Achás</hi> in his Physitians, what shal be done to Papists which trust in murther and violence?</p>

                     <p>Touching the thing prayed for in verse 32. what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son had the Apostle to desire this deliuerance from the disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient Iewes, (vnbeleefe is the greatest disobedience, refusing to submit to the commandement which bids vs belieue in Christ,
<pb n="1235" facs="tcp:20835:615"/>
and makes men disobedient to the word of precept, as well as of promise) was he so timorous as he feared to bee slaine and killed of them? And what need was there to pray for acceptation of his Almes (a matter so desired and delightful to the poorer sort) &amp; out of all this verse, what should we learne for our edisication in godlinesse, as also out of the v. 33. what say ye to these things?</p>

                     <speaker>Sil.</speaker>
                     <p>Of the former petition, the cause was not immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate feare of danger, or a mind vnprepared to suffer affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, see Actes. 21, 13. but partly, the prophesies of the Spirit, reuealing to him continuall and great troubles to happen to him at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Act. 20, 22. 23. &amp; the extreme malice of the Iewes, hating <hi>Paul</hi> as a most resolute cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of the Messias doctrine, and a rigorous enemy or oppugner of the legall ceremonies and Mosaicall rites, (as shadowes which were to giue way to the presence of the body, which is Christ,) and finally, that he might not be wanting to his owne preseruation (the care whereof nature &amp; God haue laid on euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yea euery creature. Hereby teaching vs first, that the Gofpell hath no more fierce enemies then ignorant zeale: witnes the fury prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised by Iewes and Papists a gainst the Gospell of Christ, and the true professors thereof. 2. that sound and painful Preachers, are exposed to perillous aduersaries for the words sake. For such as hate the Lord, hate his seruants, as Christ told his Apostles: therefore Pastors haue neede of much Christian courage, &amp; of the prayers of the flock for their desert. 3. Against such our owne, and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches praiers, are to be opposed as chiefest refuge; because of the promise which God made them, Mat. 18, 20. Ps. 50 15. a guard of a thousand Souldiers, cannot make Gods children so safe and sure, as one sighe or prayer of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite heart. For it is God onely, that makes men dwell in safety. All saluation belongs to God, and he heares their praiers that feare him, and grants their desires. Heere are reprooued such as neglect their Pastors safety, neuer co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending it to God in their praies, much more such as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray and be procurers of their peril and trouble, as <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Coppersmith, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="1236" facs="tcp:20835:616"/>Touching his latter request, though almes be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and welcome to the needy (as bread and drinke to the hungry or thirsty) yet euen such Iewes as were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Christians, and had not whollye shaken off <hi>Moses</hi> Law, had and held a great iealousie and sinister suspition of <hi>Paul,</hi> see Acts 21, 21. which made <hi>Paul</hi> feare the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of his seruice, how it would be taken, being broght by one not very gracious to them, yet obliged vnto this office by his owne promise, and the Churches impulsion, Gal. 2, 10. Learne, that Saints haue frailties, poor Saints haue infirmities; for their Sanctification is not absolute. Hence it is, that good offices cannot alwayes bee done to them, but with some feare of vnthankfulnesse and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tow ardnesse in accepting, &amp; of il construction of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeauours: which as it did not dishearten <hi>Paul,</hi> so it ought not vs, who are to pray to haue such weaknes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses cured &amp; amended in the people, but not to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by them from doing duty: but goe on to fulfill our vocation, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did in the matter of <hi>Goliah,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his brethren did peruersely interprete his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour. So did Christ in preaching and working Myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, albeit the Iewes sinisterly attributed all hee did to vainglory, and to the worke of Belzebub. In the other words following with <hi>Paul</hi> in future euents, let vs learn quietly and contentedly to waite vpon the will of God, because it rules all, and turnes all to the best, verse 32. by the will of God; also to seeke refreshing and ioy in the society, conference, consolation, and exhortations of the godly. For as many hot coales put together, doth make one another burn the more, &amp; giue the greater warmth, so conferring and mutuall communicating of gifts kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth zeale, encreaseth godlinesse, and confirmeth in the faith of Christ: therefore such are enemies to themselues and others, which be enemies to godly conferences, and vnto brotherly fellowship.</p>
                     <p>Finally, it is a great mercie both to haue God pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to vs; &amp; one of vs at peace with another in the Lord.
<pb n="1237" facs="tcp:20835:616"/>
This is the onely work of God, who is very often there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore stiled the God of peace, Rom. 15, 5. Phil. 4, 9. <hi>Thus the God of peace be with you all, Amen.</hi> This of hauing God with vs (that is,) the presence of his fauour aswell as of his essence and power, is a most blissefull thing, the cause of all peace, prosperity, and welfare to our souls and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, now and for euet: as men be miserable without it, so most happy by it. Therefore in Scripture very often prayed for. &amp; much promised as the foundation of al our good. See Exod. 4, 12. Iosh. 1, 9. Iudg. 6, 16. Genes. 39, 2. <hi>Acts</hi> 10, 38, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>It is so: now at length, after six or seauen yeares spent and past vpon the Ocean in the maine Seas, wee are brought through by the good conduct of that grand &amp; most skilfull Pilot Christ Iesus vnto the arriuing place. For after some friendly and familiar salutations of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine speciall members of the Church at <hi>Rome,</hi> whome <hi>Paul</hi> would honour with mentioning them, and giuing them their due praise to verse 18. then he shutteth vp the Epistle with a graue admonition, to beware of Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall seducers, and with a deuout exaltation or celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods power, goodnes, wisedom and glory; from v. 18. to the end of the Chapter.</p>
                     <p>In the first verse, hee commends a certaine Woman, whom he describeth by her name [<hi>Phebe,</hi>] Secondlie, her profession, [<hi>a Sister.</hi>] Thirdly, by her condition or office [<hi>a Seruant, &amp;c.</hi>] In the second verse, hee expresseth what he would haue them to do for her, 1. to receiue her, 2. to vse her as a Saint. 3. to assist her: and then he noteth the reason wherefore, because of her beneficence and libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to others, not to a few, and euen to <hi>Paul</hi> himself. She is called a Sister, for the common faith and religion sake, and a seruant to the Church, either for that shee was one of the widdowes, whose election and duty is at large set forth, 1 Tim. 5. or for hir charity towardes the Church, which sne entertained in her house, and succoured with reliefe; and this is most likely, 1. because of hir long iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from <hi>Greece</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> which for an old widdowe had bin too much: &amp; 2. for hir large bounty exercised toward <hi>Paul</hi> and many more, which was vnpossible for a poore widow (such as Deaconesses were, which in the Primitiue Church attended sicke persons. To commend hir, signifies to praise hir, as one beloued of him for religion sake, and to put hir ouer to their trust and care, to be counselled &amp; aided by them of <hi>Rome,</hi> in things wher of she might haue need of them. <hi>Cenchrea</hi> was an hauen neere <hi>Corinth.</hi> He would haue her receiued, and louingly entertained, [<hi>In the Lord</hi>) that is, either for the Lords sake, in his name, &amp;
<pb n="1239" facs="tcp:20835:617"/>
for his loue, or as the Lord himselfe.

                     <p>In the example of this woman thus commended and described (as in a Looking glasse) we may beholde these things for our edification. First, the custome &amp; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of helping and pleasuring good Christians, with our commending them to such as be good, is both good and ancient, warranted by the practise of an holy Aposile. The reason hereof is, because it serues both for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deds sake, to exercise charity toward them, procuring them succour by our creditc, and 2. for their sakes vnto whom they be commended, that they may haue occasion to shew their loue, and may know towards whom to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare it worthily. In our commendations, this caution is to be obserued: that they whom wee praise, and eyther speake or write for, be good or praise worthy, &amp; knowne so to vs, least we wrong them to whom wee send Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatory letters, by leading them into an error, &amp; our selues by bearing false witnesse against the 9. comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement; for to commend the vnworthy, is a deceite and a false testimony. If men thought on this, they would not displease God to pleasure a man.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we learne that in receiuing the godlie, wee must both consider their dignity, that they are Saints and holy ones which wil draw honour towardes them, and that in louing and helping them, we giue proose of our reuerence &amp; loue to Christ their lord, which wil make vs
<pb n="1240" facs="tcp:20835:618"/>
cheerefull in these duties, when we beleeue that we do for the Lords sake, to be gratefully accepted, as it were done to the Lord himselfe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, heere is a comfort for gracious women, that they doe belong to the kingdome of heauen; for with God neyther male nor female, all one in Christ: holy Scripture hath registred in perpetuall record the faith and famous acts of sundry of both sexes, to shew himselfe free from acception of persons, and to incourage the weaker sexe to labour in godlinesse, seeing their loue and goodnes is not forgotten, but had and kept in remembrance.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, heere is an example to such of both sorts as be noble and wealthy, to be full of good workes, as <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas,</hi> Acts 9, 36. as <hi>Susanna</hi> and <hi>Ioanna</hi> and many others, Lu. 8, 2, 3. and as this <hi>Phoebe.</hi> The wiues haue not so much li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty as widdowes, yet they may bee bountifull and giue much to good vses, where husbands doe make good al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, inabling them wherewith to expresse their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and when the case is such as was the case of <hi>Abigail,</hi> 1.

                     <p>Lastly, heere is a reproofe vnto rich men which suffer women to excell them in bounty and piety. Many good women who haue testified the sincerity of their faith by their liberality, for maintenance of relgion, and learning, and comfort of the poore, shall go to heauen to be in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when rich churlish Nabals, and epicurish gluttons, as he in Luke 16. shall bee adiudged to beare shame in hell for euermore.</p>

                     <p>To [salute] is with heartiest desire to pray for the well-fare and health of others: such a duty would not bee done cursarily, perfunctorily. <hi>Pauls</hi> heart and pen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in one, whose respect and purpose in these his salutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="1241" facs="tcp:20835:618"/>
is, to manifest more vnto the brethren at <hi>Rome</hi> his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire good will and sincere loue towards them and their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. Secondly, to countenance these persons heere sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, that by their authority and guists were most inabled to stead and helpe the rest in their course of godhnesse. Thirdly, to prouoke others to emulation, and study of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating these so commended. And lastly, by these pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses (as by a spurre in their side) to excite these so saluted, to proceede and profite more in all graces. Wee willingly imbrace and follow such good things, as others which be godly and wise (as <hi>Paul</hi> was) do praise in vs.</p>
                     <p>These persons saluted, were some men and some women, some Preachers, some professors onely, some Iewes, some Gentiles; some onely named, some both named and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Epithites of praise. They bee 28. in number, and besides single persons, greeting is sent to some whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. Lastly, salutations be sent both singularly from a particular man as <hi>Paul,</hi> and generally from whole Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, verse 16. The first paire saluted, be <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Pris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilla,</hi> verse 3. of whom reade Acts 18, 2, 18. who are heere commended foure wayes: First, though they were no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, yet were to <hi>Paul</hi> his fellow-helpers, not as work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him in the same trade, Acts 18, 3. but in the Lord, that is, in the Lords businesse, the spreading of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell: for as they instructed <hi>Apollos</hi> in the way of the Lorde more perfectly, Acts 18, 16. so no doubt out of then zeale &amp; piety they laboured to bring others to the faith of Iesus. Note heere <hi>Pauls</hi> modesty, admitting the helpe of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors in his labour for the Gospell: the head disdaineth not the feete; they were as feete in respect of <hi>Paul,</hi> being a principall member of the Church, yet hee despiseth them not, but meekely receiueth their assistance.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, their charity in communicating their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to the good of others. As a Cloud the raine, and a Ewe her milke, so they powred out their wisedom in scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for instruction of many: all our knowledge (like a Candle) ought to shine vnto others for their direction.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="1242" facs="tcp:20835:619"/>Thirdly, the Popes arogancie in disdaining such helpers he and his mitred Byshops wil haue no such coadiutors: nay, they forbid Lay-people so much as to reade Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: they keepe them in grosse blindnesse, thicker then Egyptian darknesse, that they may not see their deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full trickes, and horrible abhominations in their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and worship, in their teaching and liuing. I reade of some burned by Papistes, for hauing a Testament a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them.</p>
                     <p>The second praise is, that for <hi>Pauls</hi> sake, they put their liues in danger (laying downe their neckes, signifying their readinesse to dye for his loue and cause) which as it doth serue for a pattern to Ministers both to set out the condition of such as teach the Gospell to bee as Lambes amongst Wolues; and the constancie that ought to bee in them, for preaching truth to put their liues in ieopar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as <hi>Paul</hi> did: so to all Christians for imitation of the zeale of <hi>Priscilla</hi> and <hi>Aquila</hi> in behalfe of <hi>Paul</hi> their tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. It is to be noted both with a checke to such as ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leade their instructors into dangers (as many mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hearers do) or do forsake them in their trobles, as they of whom the Apostle complaines, 2 Tim. 4, 16. and with a comfort to all such as in perillous times and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses sticke to their Pastors who haue diligently fed them; sithence Gods Spirite hath registred this example to the immortall praise of these two, who loued not their own liues, to deliuer their instructer from death. There is a maruailous straite coniunction betweene pastour and flocke.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, he saith of himselfe, and all the Churches of the Gentiles, that <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> had made them their debters: and this he saith for good reason, because their benefit was publicke, redounding vnto the whole Church, to preserue such a worthy seruant of the church. Whereof this vse is to be made, that to do good to faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pastors, by preseruing their life and liberty, is a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall benefit; for the which, thankes are from all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="1243" facs="tcp:20835:619"/>
due, which should hearten true hearers (as cause requireth) not to spare purse, paines, nay their owne persons and liues, to succour such as are profitable to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
                     <p>The last thing in their praise was, that they had a Church in their house; eyther for that their family for their godly order obserued in it, seemed to be a Church, such religious exercises beeing there vsed priuately (so farre as lawfully might be) as publikely in the assemblies were frequented: and thus it should bee in euery house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold; or else for the faithfull, (which being not many at first) gathered together in their house, to celebrate their assemblies: for they might not haue in most places the free vse of Christian religion, through the malice of the Iews somewhere, &amp; elsewhere of Gentiles: see Acts 13, &amp; 14. <hi>Epenetus</hi> is intituled the first fruits of <hi>Achaia,</hi> both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee was in order of time the first which professed Christ in that country, (as first fruites came before the rest) and for that in degree of piety and vertue excelled others, as first fruites are both reaped before, and be the chiefe and choice of the crop. A worthy thing it is to giue the onset, and begin to leade others the way, which feare and worldlinesse makes men backward to doe; yea keepeth numbers from following others that haue bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Ice, and made an entrance into the zealous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession and practise of Christianity.</p>
                     <p>The other titles of beloued, approued, of labouring in the Lorde, and beeing in the Lord, (giuen to diuers heere) doe note howe deare they were to <hi>Paul,</hi> for their profession of faith, or fruites of their faith: &amp; teach that others ought to be so farre foorth beloued and esteemed of, as they pertaine to Christ our common Lord &amp; shew the same by their faithfull endeuors to further the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. Also note v. 7. to be in Christ, signifies to be a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian or faithfull person: and to bee [approued in Christ] is to bee vnblameable or without reproofe, nay well al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed offor his faithfulnesse and constancy in the cause of Christ.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="1244" facs="tcp:20835:620"/>Whereas he salutes some of his kinsmen, learne, that to our kindred when they be godly, we are tied by a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble band, one of nature, the other of Religion: &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore such as forsake and forget their Christian religions kindred, do giue cause to fear, least neither piety nor hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity be had in regard by them. Such as were in bonds with <hi>Paul</hi> for the Gospell sake, are therefore called his fellow-prisoners. They suffered bondes and imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with him, and so shewed their hearty loue both to Christ and to his Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> whom they forsooke not, as diuers others did, 2. Timothy 4. <hi>All forsooke mee,</hi> but did cleaue to his doctrine by faith, and became his fellowes in afflictions. Let Christians learn thus to loue the word, and the Ministers of it: such imprisonment is more sweet then liberty.</p>
                     <p>Also, whereas some are commended for labouring in the Lord, and others for labouring much in him (that is, in the divulging of his truth, and edifying his Church, or doing other seruices of charity:) heereby wee do learne, that there is a difference among Labourers, some accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their meanes, opportunities, gifts &amp; great zeale, labour more and some lesse; but each are to haue their due praise, euen he who laboreth litle, as well as he who laboureth much: none are to be defrauded.</p>
                     <p>Whereas v. 13. <hi>Rufus</hi> mother is called <hi>Paules</hi> Mother, vnderstand a Mother by affection, not naturall. Obserue that <hi>Aristobulus</hi> and <hi>Narcissus</hi> are not saluted, as bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing belike not yet conuerted: and <hi>Narcissus</hi> is thought to haue bin full of riches and naughtinesse, ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many a woorthy man by calumnies, yet both hadde Christians in their families. The kisse which <hi>Paul</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth v, 16. sheweth the custome to be ancient; for the Saints at their meeting, do declare mutuall good will by a kisse, which was giuen sometime in token of subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as Gen. 42. and Psal. 2, 12. Sometimes a signe of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: this was cheefly done before the receiuing of the Eucharist, to testifie peace and brotherly amity. Whence
<pb n="1245" facs="tcp:20835:620"/>
arose the superstitious kissing the Paxe in popery, which depraues &amp; abuseth al good things. By adding [holy,] he distinguishes 1. chast kisses from wanton, &amp; 2. adulatory, and 3. proditory, and 4. dissimulatory kisses, such as <hi>Ioab Iudas,</hi> and <hi>Ammon</hi> gaue, which is no small thing. For as giuing the hande one to another at our meeting, after long absence, signifieth the deliuery of our heart to him toward whom we vse such gesture, so kissing (of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gestures) hath I know not how, the most euident &amp; expresse representation of that which is within. For, whereas life consisteth in respiration, and our breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is by our mouth, kissing is a signe that a man is ready to communicate, and as it were to infuse his own proper soule to another. A custome not so ancient for vse, 1 Pet. 5, 14. in Eastern Churches especially, but now is as gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abused in the Westerne, and by such as affoord this loue-token euen to dogs.</p>
                     <p>Finally, whereas <hi>Paul</hi> familiarly nameth and saluteth many of his acquaintance at Rome, and farre more then other Churches being better knowne vnto him, yet not once mentioneth <hi>Peter,</hi> who should be the chiefe Pastor there, as Papists say: The Apostle either did forget and neglect him (which is vnlike,) or <hi>Peter</hi> was vnworthy (as an Apostata) of his salutation, which is vntrue: or <hi>Peter</hi> was not then at Rome, which is not vnprobable, yea, whether he were there at all or no, is vncertaine. For we do not finde in all the history of the Acts, or other partes of the new Testament, that euer <hi>Peter</hi> came at Rome, no not one syllable to that purpose; therefore it can bee no Article of faith, or thing necessary, to bee beleeued vnto saluation: for all such things are either expresly written or by necessary deduction to bee collected out of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which are (as <hi>Origen</hi> saith) the sole norme and rule of Faith. the vnmooueable Canon of verity (as <hi>

<pb n="1246" facs="tcp:20835:621"/>
quite contrary. For <hi>Paul</hi> was conuerted a year or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, after the ascension of our Lord. The third yeare after <hi>Pauls</hi> miraculous conuersion in his way to <hi>Damas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, Peter</hi> went to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where hee continued with <hi>Paul</hi> the space of fifteene dayes, Gal. 1, 18. all this while <hi>Peter</hi> was not at <hi>Rome.</hi> Eight yeeres after <hi>Pauls</hi> conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>Peter</hi> was abiding at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> beeing imprisoned was sought for to be killed by <hi>Herod,</hi> about the 3. yeare of <hi>Claudius:</hi> as yet then he was not at <hi>Rome,</hi> Acts 12, 2, 3, 4. &amp;c. Sixe yeares after that, euen full fourteene yeares after that hee first had met <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> (which was the 51. yeare from Christs birth) hee was at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where hee gaue <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> the right hand of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship, Gal. 2, 9. At which time a councell was held at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Acts 15. and then it was agreed vpon by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall consent, Galat. 2, 9. that <hi>Paul</hi> should preach vnto the Gentiles, and <hi>Peter</hi> to the Iewes, who by an edict were cast out, &amp; banished from <hi>Rome;</hi> so as all this while hee came not there. When the Councel was dissolued, whither did <hi>Peter</hi> goe? to <hi>Rome</hi> (his Sea and seate as the Papists faine) nay to <hi>Antioch,</hi> where hee was to his face (a bold acte to be done, if <hi>Peter</hi> had beene Pope) hee was I say reproued of <hi>Paul</hi> for his dissimulation, Galath. 2, 11. Moreouer, when <hi>Paul</hi> was first led prisoner to <hi>Rome,</hi> hee found not <hi>Peter</hi> there, for then would not <hi>Luke</hi> hauing so good occasion to mention him, Acts 28. haue passed him ouer in silence: and <hi>Paul</hi> hauing beene a free priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for two yeares at <hi>Rome</hi> complained that all forsooke him: What <hi>Peter</hi> too? no verily; which argueth all this space <hi>Peter</hi> not to haue beene at <hi>Rome.</hi> Sure it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible hee should sit Bishop there so many yeares, full 25. till the last yeare of <hi>Nero,</hi> as popish Chronologers rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon, and to suffer martyrdome there, and haue his Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher ther. Or if al this were true, what is this to the Pope being no successor to <hi>Peter</hi> in doctrine and piety, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer he be for place and dignity? If he had succession of his chaire (a thing more then questionable,) yet hee had none of his faith. From which <hi>Rome</hi> nowe, how

<pb n="1248" facs="tcp:20835:622"/>
persons amongst them, whom hee would haue to set as examples to follow; now hee admonisheth them whome they are to eschue, namely hereticks and schismaticks, which by opinions rent themselues from the truth of doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, or in their wicked manners giue scandals. Touching these, hee would haue them marked and narrowly looked into, because they are not easily found out, and through negligence of ouerseers, they doe creepe into the flocke. Secondly, hee wisheth to auoide them, both by shunning priuately their company for feare of taking infection from them, and of hatdening them by our familiarity; and by shutting them (after once or twice admonitions, Titus 3. 10.) out of publike assemblies by exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, (which is the sword of the Church, to strike and cut off rotten and pernicious members.) Also by casting them into banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if they goe on to peruert others, which is the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates care and part, verse 17. and in verse 18. To the end the Christians at <hi>Rome</hi> might the better consider and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline such pests and Serpents, which at <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Galatia</hi> had bia, and were like enough to be among the Romanes: also to wind in themselues to disturbe the peace, &amp; destroy truth and vnity of the Church; (which Sathan in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers most studiously endeuoureth) therefore hee giueth certaine notes whereby to know these seducing and scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous persons. The first is, they seeke to turne men from the true doctrine, (such as <hi>'Paul</hi> in this Epistle, and other Apostles in their Sermons and writings taught) broaching opinions eyther <hi>ex diametro</hi> contrary, or at least besides, (<hi>para</hi> signifies both, as Rom. 1, 26.) that doctrine which is apostolical. The purity of the wholesome words of Christ is corrupted, when ought eyther other, or otherwise is brought in, eyther when truth by humane inuentions is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteiated, or false doctrine apparantly crossing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is maintained, 1. Tim. 1. Gal. 1, 8, 9. This is then one signe of a deceiuer, to leade awry from ancient doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, receiued from the beginning by the ministry of Christ and his Apostles, Iohn 2, 20.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="1249" facs="tcp:20835:622"/>Another signe in verse 18. is their hypocrisie: howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they indeed ought to be, and in words doe pretend to be seruants of Christ, (hauing his name Iesus, Lord, &amp;c. and the profession of him much in their mouths, as if they were the onely persons that tooke pleasure &amp; care to please serue, and honour him, to defend his saith and religion) yet they doe nothing lesse, being enemies to his doctrine, and true seruants. Phil. 3, 18. and thinke they doe a meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious acte to destroy true Christians, Mat. 10, 17, 18. Iohn 16, 2, 3. The third signe is their ende they aime at, which is to serue their belly; for filthy lucre they teach things which they ought not, 1. Tim. 6, 5. Titus 1, 11, 12. making their belly (not Iesus Christ) their God, Phil. 3. 18. And who would not be ashamed to haue them for tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers who haue their belly for their God, coyning new &amp; false opinions for temporall commodities sake?</p>
                     <p>The fourth marke is from their arte and practise, which they vse when they will seduce; it is by faire and flattering speeches, whereby they steale away mens hearts, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their good, when they meane it not, (as the Serpent circumaented <hi>Eue,</hi>) promising much, and performing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, speaking pleasing things (as if they would lay bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of doune vnder their elbowes, Ezokiel 13, 18.) and with sweete sugred words praising both the persons and doings of such as they would ensnare: like Phisitions who minister delectable things, so these sooth and smooth ouer mens faults, commending where they should condemae: and this is signified (as <hi>Origen</hi> thinketh) by sheepes cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, Mat. 7, 15. As greedinesse for their bellies declares them to be rauenous wolues, &amp; as the Crododile by shew of pitty and humanity doth beguile such as come neere him; so do these corrupters seeke nothing but to deceiue by their flatterings, like <hi>Iudas</hi> or <hi>Ioab,</hi> speaking sweete words that without suspition they might put out the sting of erronious doctrine; and this their cunning makes it so hard to discouer them, and so much the more needefull to marke and obserue them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="1250" facs="tcp:20835:623"/>The last thing whereby they are heere noted, is the obiect whereupon these impostours doe worke, and it is vnwary and heedlesse people which neyther mistrust nor marke their malice. Widdowes whose houses they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoure vnder pretence of prayers and blessings, such as <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of, silly women laden with sinne, 2. Tim. 3, 6. As Sathan set on <hi>Eue</hi> first, so his seruants attempt women which are lesse cautelous, yet vehement being once won, and powerfull perswaders of their husbands, to whome they are neere and deare.</p>
                     <p>Howsoeuer this description did agree with such as did <hi>Iudaize,</hi> yoaking <hi>Moses</hi> and the law, with Christ &amp; grace in the cause of saluation, and doth also well fit other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuers and hereticks, yet neuer did coate so fit a mans backe, as these markes, doe agree with popish Fryers, Monkes, Priests, and lesuites especially, as it is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously known to the whole world, how they boast of Iesus (of whom they haue their name Iesuites) but be nothing lesse then good Christians, attending lucre, decciuing simple folkes. Also consider heere that these markes of discerning, bee so many reasons to perswade declining from seducers: for who ought not abhorre and auoide such as do peruert the pure doctrine of Christ, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade vs to sorsake the fountaine of life, to goe to Ces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternes which holde no water? such as also bee hipocrites professing the seruice of Christ, &amp; yet addicted wholy to voluptuousnesse and gaine, such as with goodly and glorious wordes doe bring asleepe vnheedfull persons, to the ende they may more securely make a prey of their goods and soules. Vpon which considerations, all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians stand bound to obserue and auoide them.</p>

                     <p>Yes, these three, one from the effects, they doe deceiue, verse 18. well may they promise life and salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but death and damnation wil proue the crop which will bee reaped of such imposters: as the Serpent begui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="1251" facs="tcp:20835:623"/>
our first parents with hope, and great promises, so do these.</p>
                     <p>The second reason is from the facility of the Romanes, verse 19. whose ready listning and obeying true teachers beeing farre and wide deuulged and knowne to their praise, might haply imbolden false teachers to attempt the peruerting of them with expectation of like successe, for ouer much easinesse in yeelding, might giue false Pro phets hope to deceiue: thus <hi>Origen,</hi> and <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, and <hi>Piscator</hi> after him doe collect the reason. Others thinke by praising their obedience hee encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to constancy, to continue stedfast in the good way, and to take heede of receiuing contrary doctrine. To which purpose hee exhorts them to ioyne prudence and simplicity, to bee so simple as not to know howe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent corrupt doctrine, yet so wise and skilfull as to bee able to discerne a strangers voice from Christs voice, like good sheepe, Iohn 10, 4, 5. and true Prophets from liars; which discretion <hi>Paul</hi> prayed for to the Philippians, Ch. 1, verse 9, 10. and exhorts the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> vnto it, Chap. 5. verse 21. why it is needfull, see 1. Iohn 4, 1, 2. Reuel. 22. Ephe. 4, 14. Which admonisheth al with knowledge to ioyne iudgement, and reprooueth such as bee wise to the world, but lacke the wisedome of the worde.</p>
                     <p>The third reason is from assurance of victory, so they watch and obserue these euill workemen, which scatter graines of errors in the Lords fielde, and striue against their errors, they shall surely ouercome by the might and grace of God, verse 20. <hi>The God of peace will bruise Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than vnder your feete, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is in this promise, an allusion to the promise in Paradice, made to our first parents, of the womans Seede to bruise the Serpents head, Gen. 3. which implyeth such a conquest and ouerthrow of Satan, as hee should neuer recouer himselfe. As <hi>Ioshua</hi> set his feete on the neckes of the fiue Kings, and destroyed them. This hath bin alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the head Christ perfectly fulfilled, and shall bee in
<pb n="1252" facs="tcp:20835:624"/>
his members, who must encounter awhile with Satan and his instruments: but so they behaue themselues valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and place all their affiance in God, it shall quickelie come to passe, that Sathan (howsoeuer he may seeme to prevaile) yet euen when one would thinke hee should ouerrun all, then shall he take the foyle. For God who is with his Church, is stronger then the enemies which do fight against it: and the peace of his Church is so deare vnto him, as none that make diuision, shall bee able to stand before him. All which, hath matter of exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to quicken vs, vnto all vigilancy in prayer, and good endeauours to withstand the assaults of the diuel, taking great heed of security, ease, and spirituall sloathfulnesse, least we be surprized on a sudden.</p>
                     <p>And heete is also a matter of consolation, that we faint not whatsoeuer combates and encounters with heretiks, Scismatickes, or otherwise happen, yet still to holde vp our head, and take heart to vs, vnder the ayde and helpe of God and his grace, seeing the victory will be ours. If we hold out but a little while, we shall vanquish, &amp; that very shortly euen in this life, whereof wee haue sundrie examples; and not onely at the day of iudgement when our victory will be consummate. A maruailous comforte that Gods Ministers and children striue against errours, sins, and schismes, with certain hope of hauing the vpper hand. Which as it must beate downe despaire, and driue away fearfull sluggishnesse, so it keepeth from presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to consider that not by our owne strength, not by our owne arme, or bow, or shielde, but it is the strength of God that giues vs the victory, <hi>And therefore not to vs Lord, not to vs, but to thy name be rendred the glory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Vpon these reasons, we in <hi>England,</hi> and other reformed Churches in <hi>Europe,</hi> may iustisie our separation from the Papists, whom we haue left and are diuided from: but first because they left the Apostle doctrins, and diuided them selues from the faith and religion of Christ, to embrace nouell errors, and diabolicall superstitions, contrarie to
<pb n="1253" facs="tcp:20835:624"/>
the receiued doctrine from the beginning; by whose hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie and flatery, if we haue not suffered our selues to be deceiued to the perdition of our soules, but continue stil to fight against the, vnder the assistance of the strong God, with vndoubted trust of an happie yssue (so wee marke and auoide them) therein we haue done but duty, obeying the commaundement of the great God, who bids vs to come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and decline such as wold with their subtle speeches and inuentions beguile vs (&amp; wriggle as a Snake whose head is off) with hope to reign in these Churches, as sometimes they did. Well they may surprize with their craftines, some heedlesignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and vnstable, but in vaine they looke to subiugate the wise and discreete Christians, vnder whose feet God shall rather treade them, and Sathan that great Dragon their Captaine, vnder whose banner they fight. For that kingdome must be destroyed, which doth make warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the kingdome of Christ, who is that stone cut out of the Mountaine without hands, which shall breake in peeces all other regiments which rise vp against it, Da. 2.</p>

                     <p>Hauing walked along with you, through a long, rough, and cragged way, now we are come vnto the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot and resting place, it being also plaine ground, I may not giue you ouer. In this last text (which some ioyne vnto the end of the 14. chapter, touching which, see M. <hi>Beza</hi> there) we haue a briefe pithy prayer vnto God, v. 24. and a large and most precious Doxologie or praise of God, 1. for his power, 2. Goodnesse, 3. Wisedome, in the rest of the verses. For the prayer, I would haue these things obserued in it. First, that vnder [Grace,] are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended whatsoeuer (from beginning, middle, and end) belongs vnto mans good now, or glory heereafter. Secondly, whereas <hi>Paul</hi> did both begin and end his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle with it, Chap. 1, 7. and nowe endeth, repeating it twice, ver. 20. and 24. it not onely teacheth what Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters ought to do by <hi>Pauls</hi> example, both to edify by tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, and earnestly to begge Gods fauour, and all the effects of it for the flocke, but also the flocke are admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished,
<pb n="1255" facs="tcp:20835:625"/>
that grace is a thing most necessarie. Not fire and water so needfull for the body, as grace for the soule: &amp; therefore often, againe and againe to be asked, and who soeuer know either the worth of grace, or the want, will much call for it. And who so do not so, either they value not grace, or feele no neede of it, which is a wofull dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Thirdly, heere is a proofe against the <hi>Arrians, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetus,</hi> and others, that Christ is equall to the Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christ is made the giuer and dispenser of Grace, which is proper to the true God.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, this prayer in the end of euery Epistle <hi>Paul</hi> wrote with his owne hand, as a signe whereby to discerne the Epistle not to be counterfet but his owne, 2 Thess. 4, 17. howsoeuer he vsed the helpe of a Scribe to pen the rest, yet this clause he vsed with his owne pen to write it. A good caution and preuention of adulterated and false writings, that they be not cogged and crowded in vnder the names of some worthy personages, to get them cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite; an iniury which hath been done to sundry learned and godly men.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the zealous praise and thankesgiuing, wherewith <hi>Paul</hi> celebrateth God in the end of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Epistle, there is nothing or litle in it, which hath not bin already handled in other Dialogues. Howbeit, to giue some touch and taste of matters wil not be amis. Note generally, that there is an hyperbaton, the sence being suspended from verse 25. til 27. and thus it must be put together. <hi>Glory be to him</hi> (that is to say) to the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wise God, who is able to establish you, &amp;c. and thus the construction is currant, and no imperfection in <hi>Pauls</hi> speech. Obserue yet further, as <hi>Paul</hi> in the entrance gaue thankes to God for the Romanes, ch. 1. ver. 8. and rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth praise for himselfe, after his description of his spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall combate, ch. 7. v. 25. and vpon the discourse of the great secret of predestination finished, ch. 11. ver. 36, he bursts out into this exclamation &amp; doxologie, O depth, &amp;c. <hi>To him be glory for euer:</hi> and now closeth the whole
<pb n="1256" facs="tcp:20835:626"/>
Epistle with the like harty sounding forth of Gods praise, it may serue to admonish vs of this dutye of praising God for our selues and others, for his mercies and benefits, for his doctrine and workes; how pleasant (as a sacrifice or an odour) it is to God, how the Saints are delighted with it, hauing thanksgiuings often in their hearts and mouths to witnesse their owne ioy in God, and to prouoke others to magnifie him. As the Nightingale because the day is not sufficient to sound foorth her songs, spendeth the night in singing, so ought wee euen in the night season to sounde forth the praises of god: for this is one of his chief seruices, and in his Children it is exceeding comely to reioyce and praise his mercies. How did <hi>Dauids</hi> penne ouerflow with the praises of his God, how doth he vrge all men to laude and celebrate his name? It is a fearefull signe of a dead heart to bee a niggard, or sparing, carelesse, or colde this way.</p>
                     <p>Learne further, that whereas praises be offered to God by Iesus Christ, verse 27. it is because through him both al good guists are conuaied to vs (as water through a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit, from the fountaine) and all praises are by him to bee referred to God, that they may be gracious, 1. Peter 2, 5. And therefore Turkes, Iewes, Pagans, which haue no true knowledge of Christ, they cannot worship the true God, nor giue him any praise which he shall accept of: for hee that hath not the Sonne, hath not the Father, and who so commeth to the Father not by the Sonne, shall neuerbee receiued. Oh, how much are Christians beholden to God for the knowledge of his Sonne? Thus farre of the duty of praysing God, and the manner how.</p>
                     <p>The arguments of his praise be these three, 1. from his power, 2. from his goodnesse, 3. his wisedome: First, hee commendeth his power, verse 25. whereunto he ascribeth their strengthening, wherein as he insinuateth their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, what neede they had of confirmation in respect of Sathans force, and their owne feeblenesse: so he expresly teacheth that it is God alone who can make them able to
<pb n="1257" facs="tcp:20835:626"/>
stand and perseuer in his grace to the end, as hee sayed in Chap. 14. verse 4. For it is Gods might alone which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth the power of sinne, the diuell, and the world, which be stronger then the strongest in earth.</p>
                     <p>Howbeit from his naked power disioyned from his will, there is no comfort: but the Romans were assured of Gods loue, by their calling and iustifying, &amp;c. Therefore here is matter of comfort, that notwithstanding all the fiery darts of Sathan to which they were exposed continually, and all the furie of all the tyrants in the world which persecute the poore flocke set amidst Wolues; yet they shall be vpheld, because God which loueth them, hath might enough to vp hold them. Also what <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth for, that they were certainely to hope for, being Gods Children, and the thing asked, necessary to their saluation. If any then be weake, run to God, hide you vnder his powerfull protection; if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny finde strength to continue, attribute the whole glory to God, who sayeth to the weake, be strong, and comforteth the feeble minded, shewing his power in greatest weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, 2. Cor. 12, 9.</p>
                     <p>The next part of his praise is his goodnesse, manifested in the Gospell, (which is the preaching of Iesus Christ) the greatest outward mercy of God, as the instrument to work grace within: wherein wee bee warned that our strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and corroboration of our hearts must be drawne nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from humane reason, philosophy, traditions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions of men, no not from the law of God, which dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couers sinne, and directs to duty, but comforts not against terrors within and without; but from the Gospel preached, which is the power of God, to the establishing of the hart in faith. Therefore it should continually with great reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence be read, heard, studied, and meditated, as Gods arme to confirme vs to the end. We are further to note heere in few words the dignity of the Gospell, (so he cals his owne Epistle, as Chap. 2. verse 16.) It is a doctrine of most singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar worthinesse and value. It is extolled and set foorth heere by foure reasons, first by the obiect (Christ Iesus) in
<pb n="1258" facs="tcp:20835:627"/>
whom are shut vp all treasures of wisedome. It is tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the preaching of Iesus Christ, not so much actiuely which he preached, as passiuely being preached concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him, as the matter and subiect of it, (for the Gospel is a good worde or message of Christ) and not onely the efficient cause and reuealer of it. <hi>Paul</hi> (lesse may other Ministers) taught neither himselfe nor from himselfe, but Christ by a reuelation from Christ, Gal. 1, 16.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, by the forme (a mystery reuealed now by the Scriptures of the Prophets) beeing before in the other ages precedent euen from the worlds beginning kept secret: of the acceptions of the word mystery, looke Dialogue on Rom. 11. verse 25. Heere it would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the vocation of the Gentiles, (rather then of the whole doctrine of Christ) according to Ephe. 3, 4. which heeretofore was taught in some sort to the Iewes onely, and but to some of them, and obscurely in darke sentences and prophesies that all nations should bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored by Christ: yet in comparison of that cleare and bright knowledge which since Christ, hath shined from the beames of the word, it may be said to be kept secret, and to haue beene hidden. Let men therefore so much the more prouoke themselues euen to reall and great thankefulnesse, by how much more grace is vouchsafed vs aboue that which the fathers of the old Testament en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyed, or else to looke for the greater condemnation. Many kings and Prophets haue desired to see these daies, &amp;c. Woe be to thee <hi>Corazin,</hi> if the great works &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Learne yet moreouer both the antiquity of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell (to quit vs from nouelties) &amp; the harmony betweene it and the Prophets, in that by the Scriptures of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets it is saide now to bee made manifest to vs, whoe ought therefore to study the Prophets with a purpose to learne Christ in them: flying popery as the new way, and holding vs to the doctrine of faith as the olde and good way.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it is praised by the author (at the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
<pb n="1259" facs="tcp:20835:627"/>
of the euerlasting God) that is, according to the eternall counsell and disposition of God, who by his most high liberty and wisedome might shew this secret when and to whom, and how farre he himselfe would. The whole dispensation of the Gospell depends altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon the good pleasure of God, who as he sheddeth his raine vpon one Citty and not vpon another, and in what measure, and with what fruite hee thinkes good: so the doctrine of saluation is absolutely ordered by the appointment and commandement of God: mans wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and will heere hath no stroke.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, by the finall cause or end of the Gospell, which is, to call not a few but many, euen Iewes &amp; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles at one time or other, such as were giuen to Christ among them, vnto the obedience of faith, (that is) that they might beleeue the promises of grace resting in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by faith, which is the most excellent obedience, &amp; cause of all practicke obedience. See Dialogue on Chap. 1, v, 5. and Chap. 10, verse 16. And thus farre of the description of the Gospell by the causes ofit.</p>
                     <p>The third and last praise of God is, for his wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, (<hi>To God onely wise,</hi> verse 27.) as hee is intituled, 1. Tim. 1, 17. because wisedome is essentiall to God, and he is infinitely wise, knowing himselfe and all other things most exactly and with all perfection: also in wonderfull wisedome both making and moderating the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very fountaine of all vnderstanding and prudence which shineth in any creature, Angels, or men: hence he is glorifyed by the title [onely wise God,] but especially for that admirable wisedom reuealed in the Gospel from himselfe in maruailous and most diuine discretion. For the better explication of this title, that sentence cited by <hi>Paraus</hi> and <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> out of <hi>Origen,</hi> deserueth of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to bee read and thought on: Doe not (saith hee) so vnderstand God to be wise, as if wisedome had made him wise, as it happeneth amongst men (for men are wise ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally by a separable quality, and by participation
<pb n="1260" facs="tcp:20835:628"/>
of wisedome:) God is not so, but as author and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring of all wisedome. For God is not wise by commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of anothers wisedome, but of himselfe he is so, and of him the onely wise God, all others deriue their wisedome: worthily therefore it is written, to the onely wise God, for he alone so ingendreth wisedome, as he is not by wisedome made wise.</p>
                     <p>This clause (for euer) in verse 17. noteth eternity to the end of the world, and euerlastingly without ceasing of the blessed Angels and Saints in heauen, blisse and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and glory, will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
