            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>commend</hi> (and so say I, let us behold) <hi>the noble famous men, and the generation of our fore-elders. For many glorious acts hath the Lord done in them, &amp; shewed his great power ever since the beginning.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the consideration whereof, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for that I would have nothing wanting in this book that might serve thy conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, I thought it as well pertinent to deal with the righteous Father, as with the godly children. For to shadow a face only without a body, hath his deserved com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation: but who so painteth a leg with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a body, or a body without a head, it shall not be amisse, as I suppose, aswell to tearme him a foolish painter, as to judge the thing undiscreetly painted. Wherefore as wel to see the head as the leg, &amp; to hear the Father as the children, I have faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drawn out of Scripture (and not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my fancy fashioned) the death &amp; testament of <hi>Iacob,</hi> that blessed and right happy Father, added to this ancient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument
<pb facs="tcp:100777:7"/>
of the Children. Therefore, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compense my pains, read them, but read them diligently; neither read only, but be content to follow. For the imitation of good and godly men, is the direct way &amp; course to godlinesse: So may we account of <hi>Iacobs</hi> blessing: So may we throughly challenge to be his children: Children I meane, not by flesh, but spirit. The Lord which made heaven and earth, the Lord which gave his Sonne to shed his heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blood for us, GOD which disposeth all things to his pleasure, preserve our King, increase our faith, and make us thankfull for his benefits. <hi>Amen.</hi>

For this cause my father was carefull of me when I was in battaile with my brethren. Hee saw in a vision concerning mee, that the Angell of strength followed me every where, to the intent I should not be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. The second handsell was a greater battell to us, then that which wee had at <hi>Sichem:</hi> in so much that in fighting vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly with my Brethren, I chased a thousand men, and slue of them two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth persons &amp; foure of their Kings, and following after them, skaled the walls of their citie, &amp; there slew two Kings more, &amp; so we delivered <hi>Hebron,</hi> &amp; led them all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as prisoners. Then the next day we went to a strong walled, &amp; unapprochable citie, called <hi>Areca,</hi> which threatned to kill us. Therefore I &amp; <hi>Gad</hi> went to the east side of the city, and <hi>Ruben</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> unto the West &amp; South side. They that stood upon the wals supposing there had been no mo but <hi>Gad</hi> &amp; I, did set fire upon us
<pb facs="tcp:100777:34"/>
while in the mean time my brother that lay in stale, brake out upon the other two sides, and skaling the wals with ladders, entred the citie ere our enemies wist it, &amp; so we won it by the Sword, and set fire upon the Lower, and burnt it up with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> such as were fled into it. As we returned, the men of <hi>Thaffie</hi> lay in waite for our prey, and took it with our children. But we followed them to <hi>Thaffie</hi> &amp; slew them, and buried their City, spoiling all that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> was in it. And while I was at the waters of <hi>Gureba,</hi> we fell upon the men of <hi>Jobel,</hi> that came against us in battaile, and slue and spoiled both them, and also their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, that came to their aide from <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> so as we gave them no respite to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe upon us. The fift day after, there came men from <hi>Machir</hi> to fetch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our prisoners, whom we met in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell notwithstanding that they were a mighty boast, and slew them before they could get up to the place that they came <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> from. And when we came to their City, their women tumbled down stones upon us from the top of the hill whereon their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty stood: but I &amp; <hi>Simeon</hi> coasting to the back side of the towne, got unto the higher

places, and destroyed the whole city. The next day it was told us that the cities of two Kings came against us with a huge Hoast. I therefore and <hi>Dan</hi> faining our selves to be <hi>Amorrheans</hi> and Fellowes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> with them, went into their City, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the entrances in the dead time of the night, did set the gates wide open to our brethren that came after us: by meanes whereof we destroyed them &amp; all that they had, &amp; when we had sacked the city, one did cast downe the three wals thereof. Then went we to <hi>Thamua,</hi> which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> was the refuge of all the Kings for their wars. Where being angry for a hurt that I tooke, I charged upon those that stood above me: but they threw downe stones out of slinges upon me, and shot ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes at me, &amp; had killed me, but that my brother <hi>Dan</hi> reskued me. Therefore we came running upon them in a rage, and put them all to flight: and they passing by another way, went and sued humbly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Father, who made a Covenant with them, so as we did them not any more harme, but received them into league with us, &amp; delivered them all their prisoners. Then builded I <hi>Chamma,</hi> &amp; my

For <hi>Sylon</hi> lived, of whom some of you be the Children. My Father and we made eighteene yeares peace, with his brother <hi>Esau</hi> and his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. When the eighteen yeares were past after our coming out of <hi>Mesopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamia,</hi> in the fortieth yeare of my life <hi>Esau</hi> our Fathers brother came upon us with a great strong Hoast, &amp; was slaine by the Bowe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> &amp; conveyed away dead unto Mount <hi>Seir.</hi> Wee also follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Children of <hi>Esau,</hi> but his city was very strong with high Walles, and gates of yron and brasse, so as we could not enter into it, howbeit wee did shut them up within it, and besieged it. Now when they shewed not themselves abroad in twenty daies together, I put my Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met

upon my head, and in fight of them all set up a ladder, and skaling the wals, slue four of their noble men with a stone of the weight of three talents. The next day <hi>Ruben</hi> and <hi>Gad</hi> went and slew three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score others. Then they offered peace, and wee by our Fathers advise, received them into tribute.

And <hi>Rachel</hi> answered, How so? was he not first handfasted unto me, and served he not our Father fourteen years for me?
<pb facs="tcp:100777:44"/>
What shal I do to thee? For many are the wiles and policies of men, and guile goes forward upon earth. If it had been otherwise, thou shouldest not have seen <hi>Jacob</hi> in the face at this day. For thou art not his wife, but wert guilefully put to him in my stead. My father deceived me, and conveying me away that night, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered me not to see him.

Then an Angel of the Lord appeared unto <hi>Jacob,</hi> and said that <hi>Rachel</hi> should bear but two sonnes, because she had forsaken the company of her husband, and chosen continency: and if my mother <hi>Lea</hi> had not given the two Apples for his company, she should have born eight children, whereas by reason of that she bare but six, <hi>Rachel</hi> two, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God visited her in the Mandrakes.

               </note> I was no busie body in my doings, I was not hurtfull nor spitefull to my neighbour, I rayled not upon any man, neither dispraysed I the life of any, that walked in singlenesse of minde. By reason hereof, when I was thirty years old I took a Wife, because labour had consumed my strength. I never knew the pleasures of a woman through wantonnesse, but my labour made me to sleep soundly, and my father did alwayes rejoyce of my simplicity. For whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pains I took, first of all I offered all the first fruits and the first ingendred cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel unto the Lord by the Priest, and then
<pb facs="tcp:100777:45"/>
gave my Father the rest, and the Lord doubled his benefits in my hands. Yea, and <hi>Jacob</hi> himself perceived well that God wrought with my plain dealing. For unto every poor man, and to every man in adversity, gave I of the fruits of the earth with a single heart. And now my children hearken and walk in single<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of minde, for I know that the Lord is very well pleased with it.<note place="margin">

Therefore, my Children, keep Gods Law, and hold fast plainnesse: walk on in innocency,

And if the offender be a servant or bondman, it accuseth him to his master, and deviseth all means that may be to persecute him, and to put him to death if it be possible: for hatred worketh with spitefulnesse, and is alway sorry to hear or see men go forward, or prosper in well-doing.<note place="margin">

him of it gently, driving out the poyson of hatred, and fostering no deceit in heart. And if the offender confesse it, and be sorry for it, give it him: and if he deny it, strive not with him, lest he fall to swearing, and so sinne double. Let no stranger hear you uttering one anothers secrets in variance, lest he turn to be your ill-willer, and worke some great mischief against you. For he will talke guilefully with thee, and undermine thee to do thee a shrewd turn, taking his poyson at thine own hand. Therefore if he deny it, and he ashamed of it, and hold his peace when he is rebuked, draw him not out, for in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he repenteth him, so as he will no more offend thee, but honour thee, and fear thee, and be in quiet.

Now, if a man be enri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by evill means, as <hi>Esau</hi> my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers brother was, envy him not: for in so doing ye controll the Lord, who either taketh away his benefits from the wicked, or leaveth them still to the repentant, or else reserveth them in the unrepentant to their endlesse punishment.

Being still in health, he said unto them: Ye children of <hi>Aser,</hi> hearken unto your father, and I will shew you all things that are right before the Lord. The Lord hath given two wayes unto the Sons of men,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Two wayes for a man to walk in.</hi>
               </note> two mindes, two doings, two places, and two ends: and therefore all wayes may be one; yea though they be contraries, as are the wayes of good and evill. Also there are two mindes in our breasts,<note place="margin">

               </note> which doe move us either to honesty or dishonesty. Therefore if a man be led to goodnesse, all his doings are occupied about righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse: and if that be doe any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misse, by and by he repenteth him: for in as much as his minde is bent unto righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, he putteth away naughtinesse, and out of hand amendeth his misdeeds, and correcteth the corruptions of his mind. But if his minde incline unto evill, all his doings tend unto naughtinesse, in so much that he thrusteth away the good, and taketh unto him the bad, because he
<pb facs="tcp:100777:66"/>
is under the dominion of <hi>Belial:</hi> and if he doe any good thing, he turneth the same unto evill. For if he begin to do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good, he bringeth the end of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to an evil work, because the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his heart is infected with the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome of a divel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I am even sorrowfull at the heart: and he comforted her that was not sick: yet again she entred in to me (her Husband being without) and said: I am strangled or choaked: either I will break thy neck, or else drown my selfe, without thou wilt obey me. And I perceiving that the Spirit of <hi>Belial</hi> troubled and vexed her prayed unto the Lord my God, and said thus: wherefore art thou vexed and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, all blinde in sinne?

            <p>THese Testaments were hidden and concealed a long time, so as the Teachers and the ancient Interpreters could not finde them. Which thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened through the spitefulnesse of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> who by reason of the most evident, manifest and often Prophecies of Christ, that are written in them, did hide them a long while. At length the <hi>Greeks</hi> being very narrow searchers out of ancient writings, tought these Testaments wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and got them more warily, and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated them faithfully out of <hi>Hebrew</hi> into <hi>Greek.</hi> Nevertheless this writing continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed yet still unknown, because there was not any man to be found that was skill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full both in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latine,</hi> nor any Interpreter that might procure the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of this noble work, untill the time of <hi>Robert</hi> the second, surnamed <hi>Grosthead,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> who sent diligent searchers as far as <hi>Greece,</hi> to fetch him a

Copy of the said writing, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of their charges, which he bare most liberally. Therefore, to continue the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories of those most lightsome Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, to the strengthening of the Christian faith, that reverend Bishop did in the year of our Lord, 1242. translate them pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and faithfully, word for word out of <hi>Greek</hi> into <hi>Latine</hi> (in which two tongues he was counted very skilfull) by the help of M. <hi>Nicholas Greek,</hi> Parson of the Church of <hi>Datchot,</hi> and Chaplain to the Abbot of St. <hi>Albons,</hi> to the intent that by that means the evident Prophecies which shine more bright than the day light, might the more gloriously come abroad, to the greater confusion of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and of all Hereticks, and enemies of the Church of Christ, to whom be praise and glory for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
