            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And when it was day, the Magistrates sent the Sergeants, saying,
Let those men go. And the Keeper of the prison told this saying
unto Paul, the Magistrates have sent to let you go: now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
depart and go in Peace. But Paul said unto them, they have
beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
prison, and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily, but
let them come themselves and fetch us out. And the Sergeants told
these words unto the Magistrates: and they feared when they
heard that they were Romans. And they came and besought them,
and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the City.</p>

march up in a warlike manner towards <hi>London,</hi> threatning to
force the Houses and plunder the City if they had adhered to

the short time prefixed to them, approaching within few miles
of the City with their whole body, seizing the Block-houses
on the River by violence, quartering their Forces round about
it, and sending their Warrants for provisions to Constables,
within the very lines of Communication. Whereupon the
Houses to provide for their own safety and the Cities, if the
Army should invade them by open force; both Houses on the

the Army and their Instruments took occasion to traduce them
as guilty, yet they began to draw their quarters, and disperse
themselves further off from <hi>London;</hi> but with a Resolution to
take the first occasion of returning thither before they were sent
for, the gaining of the City and Tower of <hi>London</hi> into their

them in all their unreasonable desires, they thereupon projected
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:39583:5"/>
to make one unreasonable demand more, which might in all
probability occasion it, and they divide the City and both
Houses one from another; and that was to desire the Houses to
repeal the Ordinance for the New Militia of <hi>London,</hi> (which
no ways concerned the Army in point of interest or right) and
to restore the old without any exceptions to their persons, or
any cause alleadged, or once acquanting the City therewith,

               </gap>ct against it, who never
had the least intimation of it till it was past. The pretence for
this hasty passing, was, to prevent the the Armies-speedy march
to <hi>Westminster,</hi> if the Houses refused to pass it; and the Cities
opposition against it, if not passed before their Notice of it; but
the real design was to discontent the City, and enforce them to
some act or other, as might give the Army occasion to march
rather against them, then against the Houses, and engage them
and their party in the Houses against the City and their Friends.
This Ordinance of Repeal being made known to the City, the
next day, being Saturday, <hi>Iune</hi> 24. they were much discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
at it; and meeting at a Common Councel, voted unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monsly
against it, as a great injury and astront unto them; both,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:39583:5"/>
because the Houses and Army never acquainted them therewith,
but did it on a sudden in a thin House without their privity, or
any reason alleaged, or just exceptions to the New Militia in
the Ordinance for such an alteration, which so highly concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their safety and priviledges; and because the Repeal of this
Ordinance, upon no other grounds but the Armies desire,
might justly shake all other Ordinances for securing the vast
sums they had lent and advanced upon the Excise and Sale of
Bishops Lands, and for their Indempnity, and make them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealable
at the Armies pleasure, as wel as this, to their utter
undoing. Whereupon they resolved to Petition the Houses on
Monday morning for the Repeal of this hastty injurious Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of <hi>Iuly</hi> 23. for selling the New Militia, and drew up a
Petition then for that purpose; which the Sheri<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Counsel
presented to the Houses on Monday the 26. of
<hi>Iuly:</hi> After which about a thousand Apprentices, and young
men of the City, without any armes at all, came with another
Petition of their own to both Houses, wherein they Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated,
that they were heirs apparant to the City, whose Rights
and Priviledges they were sworn to defend, and the Houses
had of times promised to maintain; That the ordering of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
Militia was the Cities Birth-right, belonging to them by
Charters confirmed in Parliaments, for defence where of they
had adven<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ured their lives and fortunes as far forth as the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
and therefore desired it might be returned into those hands,
in which it was put by the whole Cities consent, by the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of the 4. of <hi>May;</hi> Upon reading these Petitions in the
Lords House, they were pleased to revoke the Ordinance of
<hi>Iuly</hi> 23. and resume that of <hi>May</hi> 4. by a new Ordinance of
<hi>Iuly</hi> 26. which they sent down to the Commons, where some
Apprentices were over-earnest and urgent to get the Ordinance
passed, refusing to suffer some Members to go out of the House,
till they had passed the new Ordinance sent from the Lords, or
to come out of the House into the L<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>bby, when they were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
upon the Vote, about it, which at last they passed about 3
of the clock; Whereupon most of the Apprentices departed
quietly into the City, without any further disturbance. After which
some disorderly persons, most of them Malignants, &amp; disbanded
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:39583:6"/>
Souldiers, not Apprentices (by the instigation of some Masig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
Sectaries and Friends of the Army) gathered about the
Commons door, and grew very outragious, enforcing the
Speaker to take the Chair after the House had adjourned, not
suffering him or the Members to depart the House, till they had
voted: <hi>That the King should come to London to treat with the
Houses about a peace.</hi> With which violence the <hi>Common-Councel
of London</hi> being acquainted as they were sitting in the
Guild Hall, they presently sent the Sheriffs with such assistance
as was ready at hand (the Militia then being in an unsetled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
by the <hi>Houses</hi> own act, and contradicting Ordinances)
to suppress the tumult, and rescue the Members; who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
hasting to <hi>Westminster,</hi> did their best endeavours to effect
it; and at last pacified the unruly rout, and conducted the
Speaker in safety to his Coach and lodging about nine of the
clock at night, which was as much as could be expected from
the City, in this interval of their Militia's unsettlement. The
Lords adjourned their House till Fryday morning; the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
only till the next morning being Tuesday; against which
time the New established Militia provided a strong Guard for
the House it self: Whether the Speaker and Members repaired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
10 of the clock safely without any interruption, and there
sate securely, till they agreed to adjourn the House till Friday
morning following, upon this ground; that the <hi>Lords had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed
their House till that time,</hi> and had made <hi>a peremptory
Order for all their Members then to attend the House, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
any former leave granted to be absent.</hi> The next day
being the monthly fast the Speakers and Members met at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garets
Church</hi> in <hi>Westminster,</hi> and there kept the solemn Fast
without disturbance: Where M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Speaker</hi> in the Church com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
Publikely to <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Ralph Ashton,</hi> and other Members setting
near him, to this effect; <hi>That there was a great scandal raised
on him in the City, which did much trouble him, as that he had
left the House, and was run away privatly to the Army, or inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to do it:</hi> Tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he had no such thought, and sco<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ned to do such
a base, unjust and dishonorable action; and would rather die
in the <hi>House</hi> and Chair, <hi>then desert them for fear of any tumults.</hi>
Which being spoken in the Church and presence of God on the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:39583:6"/>
solemne Fast day, when he would not dissemble, makes most
men conclude, his secret departure to the Army the very
next day, proceeded not from his own judgment or incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
but from some strong invitations or menaces sent
from the Army by those who contrived this desperate plot
to divide the City &amp; Houses, and bring up the Army to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrall
them both. On Thursday Morning early the new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
<hi>Militia</hi> of London, to prevent all future disturban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to the Houses, made publike Proclamation throughout
the City &amp; Suburbs, &amp; set up printed tickets at Westminster
&amp; other usuall places within the Line, that if any person or
persons should offer to disturb either of the Houses or their
Members, the Guards should apprehend them, and in case of
resistance kil or shoot them. Yet not withstanding the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
in the evening stole away through Hide Parke in his
Coach to the Army, and went to Windsore to the Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quarters,
accompanied with Sir <hi>Ar. Hasterig</hi> &amp; other Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
who met him by the way. On Friday morning about
140. Members or more met at the Commons House, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Speakers coming, whither the Serjeant coming
without his Mace, being demanded where the Speaker was,
answered, he knew not very well, and that he did not see
him that morning, and was told he went a little way out of
town last night, but he thought he would return, &amp; expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to meet him at the House. After which being somwhat
strictly interrogated by some Members about the Speaker,
he suddenly withdrew himself, and could not be found, till
the House had chosen a new Speaker &amp; Serjeant, and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
a Mace; and then he returned with the Mace carried af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him under his mans cloke, which he said he had been see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
out all the time of his absence. The House, after two
houres attendance, sent 4 of their Members to the Speakers
house, to inquire what was become of him; who returning
reported from his servants, that he was gone forth of town
the evening before, &amp; was not likely to return that day, and
that they conceived he was gone to the Army: whereupon
they resolved to chuse a new Speaker after some debate,
and called Mr. <hi>Henry Pelham</hi> to the Chaire; after which
they chose a new Serjeant in the absence of the old. In the
meane time the Lords assembling in their House upon spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:39583:7"/>
Order and Summons, received a Letter of excuse from
the Earle of Manchester for his absence, by reason of some
indisposition befallen; whereupon they chose the Lord
Willoughby of Parham their Speaker in his roome, having
frequently changed their Speaker this Parliament, as they
saw occasion: And about three of the clock that day, the
Commons presented their new Speaker to the Lords sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in their Robes after the accustomed manner, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
to their choice, to prevent a discontinuance and
faler of the Parliament for want of Speakers to adjourne
and continue it, and prevent all scruples which might arise
thereupon. This done they proceeded to vote and act as
a Parliament, which they might lawfully doe. First they
voted in the eleven wrongfully impeached <hi>Members,</hi> and
others unjustly questioned by <hi>Cromwells</hi> and his <hi>confederates</hi>
practise in the <hi>Armies</hi> name, to take away their Votes, to
<hi>attend the seruice of the House,</hi> which they accordingly did:
Next they revive and set up the Committee for the Safety
by an <hi>Ordinance of both Houses; authorizing them to joyne
with the Committee of the restored City Militia;</hi> and by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
Votes &amp; Ordinances gave power to these Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees
for the <hi>listing and raising of Forces, appointing chiefe
Commanders and Officers issuing out arms and ammunition for
the safety and defence of both Houses and the City, against all
such who should forcibly invade them:</hi> which Votes &amp; Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
for their self-defence (warranted by <hi>the very Law
of nature,</hi> as the Armies <hi>Declarations</hi> assent) were not passed
nor put in execution, till the Army under Sir <hi>Tho. Fairfax</hi>
(recruited extraordinarily every day without &amp; against the
Houses Orders) <hi>were on their march towards London, &amp; most
contemptuously disobeyed the Votes and Letter of both Houses,
inhibiting them to come within 30. miles of the City:</hi> which
Letter Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> out of his great humility refused to <hi>much
as to answer, or take notice of:</hi> whereupon the <hi>Army</hi> drawing
near the Houses and City in a warlike manner, with a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to force &amp; assault them by violence; thereupon the
Committee of Safety and the <hi>Militia</hi> of London by Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
and speciall command of both Houses, raised new
Forces of Horse &amp; Foot, mounted some of their Cannons,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:39583:7"/>
manned some of their Works, and made preparations only
for their own defence, as they might lawfully do, and had
done formerly, by vertue of that supreme power of both
Houses, which first raised, and after voted down this perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Army,</hi> who now refused to obey their Masters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and marched up against them with much rage and
fury as enemies. To countenance this their trechery and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
the more, they draw the Speakers &amp; fugitive Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of both Houses to sit in Counsell with them in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
in nature of a Parliament, and to signe an <hi>Ingagement,</hi>
to <hi>live and die with Sir</hi> T. Fairfax <hi>and the Army in this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell.</hi>
Whereby they were so animated, that Sir <hi>Th. Fairfax</hi>
raised the Traine-Bands of <hi>Hertfordshire and other Counties,</hi>
to joyn with the Army, and march up against the <hi>Houses and
City;</hi> who were so desirous of peace, that they sent <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners</hi>
&amp; <hi>Agents</hi> sundry times one after another to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
an accord, and keep off the Army from approaching
neare the City; who were exceedingly sleighted, &amp; could
obtain no termes of peace or agreement from them, unlesse
they would unworthily yeeld to desert both Houses &amp; the
impeached Members, contrary to their Ingagement, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
and duty, renounce and call in their own Declaration
then newly published; relinquish their <hi>Militia,</hi> and deliver
up all the Forts and Line on the Westside of the City next
to <hi>Westminster</hi> into the Armies hands, together with the
<hi>Tower of London</hi> and Magazines in it, disband all their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
put all the <hi>Reformados</hi> out of the Line, withdraw all
their Guards from the Houses, and receive a Guard of such
Horse &amp; Foot within the Line as the Army should appoint
toward the Houses, demolish their Works, and suffer the
whole Army to march in triumph through the City, as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
Conquerours of it and both Houses too. To all which
dishonourable and base conditions (worse then any the
King or Cavaliers would or could have put upon them, in
the condition and posture of defence they then were) the
Aldermen and Common Councell, to their eternall disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and infamy, suddenly and unexpectedly condescend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Whereupon a Party of the Army entred the Line, sei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
the Forts agreed upon, and on the 6. of August the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:39583:8"/>
brought the fugitive <hi>Speakers</hi> &amp; <hi>Members to the House
with a strong party,</hi> (who might have returned at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
before without any Guard, had they pleased) placed
the Speakers in their Chaires out of which they were justly
voted, without any Order of the Houses, the Lords House
being then adjourned during pleasure; where the <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi>
was set in <hi>a Chaire of State,</hi> and received speciall thanks
for this service from the <hi>Speakers</hi> in both Houses names,
who made him <hi>Generalissimo</hi> of all the <hi>Forces</hi> and <hi>Forts</hi>
of the <hi>Kingdome to dispose of them at his pleasure,</hi> made him
<hi>Constable of the Tower,</hi> Voted the common Souldiers one
<hi>moneths</hi> gratuity for this service, besides their pay; left all
their Guards to <hi>his disposing,</hi> and to <hi>mock God,</hi> as well as
men; Voted a <hi>publike day of Thankesgiving</hi> to be kept
both in the <hi>City and throughout the Kingdome,</hi> for their <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
the Parliament to its Honour and Freedome,</hi> in this
forcible and dishonourable manner, not to be patterned
in any age. After which the Generall and his whole Army
marched through the City in greater triumph and State,

against them, contrary to both Houses Votes and Orders
without any authority but their owne.</p>
            <p>This is the true state of the case of the impeached
Lords, Commons and Citizens, who have been eagerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted
by the Army and their Confederates in the House,
when those Malignant Lords who levied actuall warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
King, Parliament and Kingdome, exempted from all
pardon heretofore by votes and Ordinances of both Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
as Traitors and publike Enemies to the Kingdome, are
suffered to go unprosecuted, yea pleaded for in the Houses,
and permitted to walk freely about the City, and repaire
to the King in the Armies Quarters, while these faithfull
Lords, Members and Citizens are shut up prisoners, and
prosecuted day by day, without any proof or guilt to
make good the Charge.</p>
            <p>The sole question then will be, who are the reall Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and actuall endeavourers or raisers of a new Warre
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:39583:9"/>
against the King, Parliament and Kingdome, in this case,
whether the impeached Lords, Members, and Citizens, or
the Army and their Confederates, and fugitive Members,
who excited them to march up thus to London against
both Houses and the City, without any Authority from
the King, Parliament, Kingdome, and Contrary to both
Houses expresse Orders, Letters and Commands?</p>
            <p>Certainely, if indifferent disinterested Members and
Persons may be Iudges, or Umpires in this case, or the
consciences of the accusers themselves may be Judges,
those Lords, Members, and Citizens listing and raising for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
onely for their owne just and necessary defence by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
Ordinances, Votes and Orders of both Houses of
Parliament, was so farre from being high Treason, or levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a new Warre in them, that it was a just, necessary
and lawfull in them, both by the Law of Nature, Scripture,
the Statutes of the Realme, the practice and resolutions
of both Houses, and of the Army it selfe in their defensive
warres against the King and his assailing forces, and a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to which their Covenant and publike Trust ingaged
them unto, under the paine of Perjury and Treachery
both to the King (taken violently by a commanded party
out of both Houses custody, and detained prisoner from
them in the Army against their Votes and Commands) and
to the Kingdome, Parliament, and City, to whose preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and defence they had so many Obligations against
a mutinous and rebellious Army, marching up thus hostile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
against them without any just ground or Authority at
all, but the executing of their owne treasonable plots
and designes both upon the King, Kingdome, Parliament
and City, as their subsequent proceedings manifest. And
every Thiefe may as justly accuse each honest man of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and
levying a new Warre, if he both but provide and
weare a Sword or Pistoll to resist him when he comes to
take his purse, or breake open his house, as the Army and
their Confederates may those Lords, Members and Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens
of Treason and levying a new Warre, by this provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Forces and Armes to defend themselves in case the
Army should violently affault the Houses or the City in a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:39583:9"/>
rebellious and hostile manner, without shedding one drop
of blood, or marching out of their Lines to fight with
them, though they gave them just occasion; and therefore
Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> and the <hi>Army</hi> in their <hi>Remonstrance</hi>
of <hi>August,</hi> 18. 1647. p. 19. 20. confesse ingenuously, That if
those pretended Votes, Orders and Ordinances whereby
War was levyed against those Members of both Houses who
fled to the Army, were <hi>then good</hi> (when as they were made)
<hi>and valid, though they should now be repealed, yet WE with the
SPEAKERS and those Members aforesaid in opposing of them
while they were of force,</hi> must needs remaine Transgressors
still, <hi>and yet God and wee are thanked for it.</hi> To avoid
which dangerous worke, they forced the Houses (by
a more horried force then that of the Apprentices,
and this menacing Treasonable Remonstrance, to passe
an <hi>Ordinance, 20 August, 1647, for declaring all votes,
Orders and Ordinances passed in one or both Houses,</hi> since the
force on both Houses, July 26, untill the <hi>sixt of this present
August to be null and void.</hi> Of purpose to excuse themselves
from this very guilt of High Treason, in leying warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the King, Kingdome and Parliament, which they
would most injuriously fasten upon others who are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
to evade their owne guiltinesse.</p>
            <p>But neither God nor man will be long thus mocked or
deluded by them: and this present Age and all future Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
will conclude at last in despite of all opposite
Powers and Evasions; That the <hi>Generalls</hi> and <hi>Armies</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing

to keep divers Members out of the House, and pull them

and it shall most certainly come to passe in his due time, if they
can but with faith, and patience, wait upon him till its accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment,
without fainting or despair.</p>
            <p>Now because the <hi>Generall, Councell</hi> and <hi>Army</hi> are so eager in
pressing for justice upon some <hi>Members,</hi> and the imprisoned <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen</hi>
and <hi>Citizens,</hi> pretending them guilty of the <hi>Apprentices
force upon the Houses</hi> (of which there is no evident proof) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
their kindnesses we shall evidently demonstrate there is
greater cause for the Houses and City to crave justice against
them, as being far more guilty of <hi>forcing the Houses</hi> in a <hi>horrid
and desperate manner,</hi> then the <hi>Apprentices,</hi> who so far they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in these respects.</p>
            <p>First, they and the <hi>Army</hi> marched up in an intire body from <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
their quarters towards <hi>London</hi> to force the Houses, against their
expresse Votes, Orders, and the Cities desires; The <hi>Apprentices</hi>
did not so, having no command from either House, not to repair
to <hi>Westminster,</hi> nor no Members sent to them as Commissioners
to stay their march, as the Army had; whom no doubt they
would have better obeyed then the Army did the Houses Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>Apprentices</hi> were all unarmed, without Swords <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
or sticks in their hands, and not above one thousand or two at
most: whereas the <hi>Army</hi> were all furnished with Swords, Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,
Pikes, pistols, Armes, Staves, and a train of Artillery, and
marched up with <hi>Banners displaied</hi> in a body of fifteen thousand
fighting men or more.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the Armies force and violence proceeded from their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
own mutinous disposition, and the personall malice of some of
their chief Officers against the xj. eminent <hi>Members,</hi> and others
who crossed their private designes, without any just provocation,
or preceding president of such a force and rebellion in any other
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:39583:12"/>
of the Parliaments Armies. But the <hi>Apprentices</hi> force as it was
successive too, so it was encouraged and occasioned by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to revive the <hi>Ordinance</hi> for the Cities <hi>New Militia,</hi> passed
by unanimous consent of both Houses when full and free;
which the Generall and Army had forced the Houses to repeal
when thin, and under their power and terror, against the rules of
Honour and Iustice before one quarter of the time for which
they setled it was expired, without any notice given to the City
or new <hi>Militia,</hi> or charge or exceptions against them, to which
they might make answer.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, the <hi>Generall, Councel</hi> and <hi>Army</hi> in a forcible man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
impeached divers eminent Members, forced their withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
suspention, and expulsion from the House, and never desired
till they had driven them out of the House and Kingdome: which
done, they pressed a new purging of the Houses from many other
Members, under pretence of Malignancy, and their compliance
with the <hi>King</hi> and His Malignant party, even when and whiles
themselves were complying and holding Treaties with the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices,</hi>
never impeached, nor pressed the suspention or exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of any Members, nor kept any one Member forcibly out of
the Houses, but onely kept most of them in till they had granted
their Petition, and repealed the Ordinances and Votes which the
Army had forced from them some three daies before.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, the <hi>Army</hi> menaced and forced the Houses in and by
sundry printed Treasonable <hi>Declarations, Remonstrances, Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festoes,
Letters,</hi> and <hi>Representations;</hi> published to withdraw the
City and Country from, and animate them against the Houses and
Members, for divers weeks and monthes together; and when
their first Demands, as Soldiers, were all granted; yet still they
insist on new and Higher Demands as Subjects and Statesmen.
Whereas the <hi>Apprentices</hi> force was soon ended, and they did no
such thing, and desired nothing but what immediately concerned
the City and themselves.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixtly, the Army and their Grandees by Letters and menaces
induced and forced the <hi>Speakers</hi> and some <hi>Members</hi> (contrary
to their trust and duty) to desert the Houses and repaire to the
Head quarters, and there to enter into a strange <hi>Engagement,</hi> to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:39583:12"/>
live and die with them in their quarrel against the impeached
Members, and others who deserted not, but continued in the
Houses, and the Citizens who adhered to them. And by a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
<hi>Declaration</hi> August 18. they declared all the Votes, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
and Ordinances made in both Houses without any force
from <hi>Iuly</hi> 26. to <hi>August</hi> 6. to be <hi>null</hi> and <hi>void;</hi> and by putting
their own two armed Guards upon the Houses, by a party of
1000 Horse drawn up to <hi>Hide Parke,</hi> and with <hi>Cromwells, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,</hi>
and other Officers, menacing high Speeches in the House,
they enforced the Houses against their former resolutions to passe
an <hi>Ordinance</hi> to declare them null and voide; threatning to take
all the Members of both Houses that sate and voted in the <hi>Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi>
absence as <hi>Prisoners of War,</hi> to try them by <hi>Martiall Law,</hi> and
pull them out of the Houses by head and shoulders if they Presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to intrude into the Houses, &amp;c. By which occasion they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
away many of the remaining <hi>Members,</hi> and by force obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
their desires. The <hi>Apprentices</hi> never did any thing half so
forcible and Treasonable, as these matchlesse affronts and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies
of the Army.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, the chief <hi>Contrivers</hi> and <hi>Abetters</hi> of the <hi>Armies</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
violence and force against the Houses and Members, were perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
degenerated <hi>Members</hi> both of the <hi>Army</hi> and <hi>Commons
House,</hi> who acted and plaid their parts in both for their best ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,
as <hi>Cromwell, Ireton, Rainsborough, Harrison, Fleetwood,</hi>
with other officers who received their Commissions and wages
too from the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and therefore were obliged more then
others to obey, and not thus openly to force, affront, and rebell
against them. Whereas none of the <hi>Apprentices</hi> were Members,
nor any of them in Commission or pay as Mercenaries or Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
to both Houses.</p>
            <p>Their force therefore upon the Houses in these, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
respects being far more <hi>horrid</hi> and <hi>treasonable</hi> then the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices,</hi>
and the occasion of theirs; they ought in Law and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
to be first, and most exemplarily punished; the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they still persist therein even in this their last <hi>Representation</hi>
of <hi>December</hi> 7. (as high and treasonable as any of their former
Papers) whereas the <hi>Apprentices</hi> ended in few howers, and was
never since revived.</p>

               <hi>In brief, their own dear friend, Mr.</hi> Oliver St. John,
