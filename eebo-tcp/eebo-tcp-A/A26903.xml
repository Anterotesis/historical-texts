            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I.</head>
            <p>THere is no man that ever under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the Interest of Mankind, of Families, Cities, Kingdoms, Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and of Jesus Christ the King and Saviour, but he must needs know that the right Instruction, Education, and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of <hi>Youth</hi> is of unspeakable conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to them all. In the place where God most blest my labours (at <hi>Kidder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster,</hi> in <hi>Worcester-shire</hi>) my first and greatest success was upon the Youth. And (which was a marvellous way of Divine Mercy) when God had toucht the hearts
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45238:5"/>
of young Men and Girles with a love of goodness, and delightful obedience to the truth, the Parents and Grandfathers who had grown old in an ignorant worldly State, did many of them fall into liking and love of Piety, induced by the love of their Children, whom they perceived to be made by it, much wiser and better, and more dutiful to them. And God by his unexpected disposing Providence, having now twenty years placed me in and near <hi>London,</hi> where in variety of places and conditions, (sometimes under restraint by men, and sometimes at more liberty) I have Preached but as to <hi>Strangers,</hi> in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens Pulpits as I could, and not to any <hi>special flock</hi> of mine, I have been less Capable of judging of my success: But by much experience have been made more sensible of the Necessity of warning and instructing youth, than I was before. The sad reports of fame have taught it me: The sad Complaints of mournful Parents have taught it me: The sad observation of the wilful impenitence of some of my acquaintances tells it me. The many score if not hundred bills that have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly put up to me, to pray for wicked and obstinate Children have told it me. And by the grace of God, the penitent
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45238:5"/>
Confessions, Lamentations, and restitutions of many Converts have more particularly acquainted me with their Case. Which moved me on my Thursdays Lecture a while to design the first of every month, to speak to youth and those that educate them.</p>
            <p>And though I have already loaded the world with books, finding that God seems to be about ending my life and labours, I am urged in my mind by the greatness of the case to add yet this Epistle to the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger sort. Which shall contain I. The great importance of the Case of youth. II. How it stands with them in matter of fact. III. What are the Causes of their sin and dangerous degeneracy. IV. How great a blessing wise and godly youth are to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and others. V. How great a plague and calamity the ungodly are. VI. What great reason ungodly sensual youth have, presently to Repent and Turn to God. VII. Directions to them how to do it. VIII. And some Directions to Parents about their Education. And all must be with the Brevity of an Epistle.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. To begin betimes to live to God, is of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable importance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to your selves.</head>
            <p>FOR, 1. You were betimes solemnly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to God, as your God, your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, your Saviour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and your Sanctifier, by your Baptismal Vow. And as that was a great Mercy, it obliged you to great Duty: You were capable in Infancy of that holy Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Relation; and your Parents were presently obliged as to Dedicate you to God, so to Educate you for God: And as soon as you are capable of performance, the Vow is upon your selves to do it. If your Childhood is not presently obliged to Holiness, according to your natural ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, no doubt your Vow and Baptism should have been also delayed. Little think many that talk against Anabaptists, how they condemn themselves by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Name of Christians, while they by perfidious Sacriledge deny God that which they Vowed to him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All your time and life is given you by God, for one End and Use; and all is little enough; and will you alienate the very
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45238:6"/>
beginning, and be Rebels so soon?</p>
            <p n="3">3. The youngest have not assurance of Life for a day, or an hour. Thousands go out of the World in youth. Alas, the Flesh of young men is corruptible, liable to hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of Diseases, as well as the old. How quickly may a vein break, and cold seize on your head and lungs, and turn to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable Consumption? How quickly may a Fever, a Pleurisie, an Impostume, or one of a thousand Accidents, turn your Bodies to corruption? And O that I knew how to make you sensible how dreadful a thing it is to die in an unholy state, and in the guilt of any unpardoned sin? An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified Soul, that hath lived here but to the flesh, and the world, will be but fewel for the fire of Hell, and the wrathful Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of the most holy God. And though in the course of undisturb'd Nature, young men may live longer than the old, yet Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath so many disturbances and crosses, that our lives are still like a Candle in a broken Lanthorn, which a blast of wind may soon blow out. To tell you that you are not certain in an unsanctified state; to be one day or hour more out of Hell, I expect will not move you so much as the weight of the Case deserveth, because meer <hi>possibility</hi> of the <hi>greatest hurt,</hi> doth not affect
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45238:7"/>
men when they think there is <hi>no probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of it. You have long been well, and long you hope to be so: But did you think how many hundred Veins, Arteries, Nerves, must be kept constantly in order, and all the blood and humours in due temper; and how the stopping of one vein, or distemper of the blood, may quickly end you; it would rather teach you to admire the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful providence of God, that such a body should be kept alive one year.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But were you sure to live to maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Age, alas! how quickly will it come? What haste makes Time? How fast do Daies and Years roll on? Methinks it is but as a few daies since I was playing with my School-fellows, who now am in the 66th year of my Age: Had I no service done for God, that I could now look back upon, I should seem as if I had not lived. A thousand years, and one hour, are all one (that is, nothing) when they are past. And every year, day and hour of your lives hath its proper work: And how will you answer for it? Every day offereth you more and more mercies; and will you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise and lose them? If you were Heirs to Land, or had an Annuity, which amounted but to an hundred pounds a year, and you were every day to receive a proportionable
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45238:7"/>
part of it, or lose it; would you lose it through neglect, and say, I will begin to receive it when I am old? Poor Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers will work hard all the day, that at night they may have their wages: And will you contemptuously lose your every daies mercies, your safety, your commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, your daily blessings and his grace, which you should daily beg, and may daily receive?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Either you will Repent and live to God, or not; if not, you are undone for ever: Oh how much less miserable is a Dog, or a Toad, than such a sinner! But if God will shew you so great mercy, oh how will it grieve you to think of the precious time of Youth, which you madly cast away in sin! Then you will think, O what Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, what Holiness might I then have got! What a comfortable life might I have lived! O what daies and years of mercy did I cast away for nothing! Yea, when God hath given you the pardon of your sin, the tast of his love, and the hopes of Heaven, it will wound your hearts to think that you should so long, so unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, so heinously offend so good a God, and neglect so merciful a Saviour, and trample upon Infinite Divine Love, for the love of so base a freshly pleasure. That
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:45238:8"/>
ever you should be so bad, as to find more pleasure in sinning, than in living unto God.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And be it known to you, if God in mercy convert and save you, yet the bitter fruit of your youthful folly may follow you in this World to the grave. God may forgive the pains of Hell to a penitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and not forgive the temporal cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisement to his flesh. If you waste your Estate in Youth, you may be poor at Age: If you marry a wicked Wife, you may feel it till death, notwithstanding your Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: If by drinking, gluttony, idleness, or filthy lust, you contract any uncurable Diseases in Youth, Repentance may not cure them till death. All this might easily have been prevented, if you had but had fore-seeing Wisdom. Beggary, Prisons, Shame, Consumptions, Dropsies, Stone, Gout, Pox, which make the lives of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miserable, are usually caused by youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful sins.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And if ever you think to be men of any great wisdom, and usefulness in the World, to your selves or others, your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations must be made in Youth. Great Wisdom is not got in a little time. Who ever was an able Lawyer, Physician, or Philosopher, without long and hard Study? If you will not learn in the Grammar-Schools
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45238:8"/>
in your Childhood, you will be unfit for the University at riper Age; and if when you should be Doctors, you are to learn to Spell and Read, your shame will tell you, that you should have sooner begun. O that you well knew how much of the safety, fruitfulness and comfort of all your after-life, dependeth on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of your Youth! on the Wisdom and the Grace which you should then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain! As mens after trading doth on their Apprentiship!</p>
            <p n="8">8. And O what a dreadful danger is it, lest your youthful sin become remediless, and custom harden you, and deceivers blind you, and God forsake you for your wilful resistance of his Grace! God may convert old hardened sinners: But how ordinarily do we find, that Age doth but answer the preparations of Youth, and the Vessel ever after savoureth of the Liquor which first throughly tainted it: And men are but such as they learned to be and do at first. If you will be perfidious breakers of your Baptismal Vows, it's just with God to leave you to your selves, to a deluded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, to think evil good, and good evil, to a seared conscience, and a harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heart, and as past feeling, to work un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness with greediness, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.18. and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45238:9"/>
to fight against Grace and your own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, till Death and Hell convince you of your madness. O sport not with the Justice of a sin-hating God! Play not with sin, and with the unquenchable fire! Forsak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, is the way to be forsaken of him. And what is a forsaken soul, but a mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Slave of Satan?</p>
            <p n="9">9. Yea, did you but know of what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is, to prevent all the heinous sins, that else you will commit, you would make haste to Repent, though you were sure to be forgiven. Forgiveness maketh not sin to be no sin, or to be no evil, no shame, no grief to the soul that hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted it. You will cry out, O that I had never known it! To look back on such an ill-spent life, will be no pleasant thought. Repentance, though a healing work, is bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; yea, oft-times exceeding bitter: Make not work for it, if you love your peace.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And is it a small thing to you, that you are all this while doing hurt to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? And drawing them to sin, and plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into that dangerous guilt, which can no way be pardoned but by the blood of Christ, upon true Conversion: And when they have joyned with you in lust and fleshly pleasure, it is not in your power to turn them, that they may joyn with you
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45238:9"/>
in sound Repentance: And if not, they must lie in Hell for ever: And can you make a sport of your own and other mens damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? But this leadeth me to the Second Point. I have shewed you of what vast concernment it is to your selves to begin betimes a holy life. I will next shew you of what concernment it is to others.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. Of what Publick Concernment the Quality of Youth is.</head>
            <p n="1">§ 1. THe welfare of the World is of far greater worth than of any single person; and he hath put off Humanity who doth not more earnestly desire it. If this World consisted but of one Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then to make that Generation wise and good, would be enough to make it a happy World. But it is not so: In Heaven, and in the future glorious Kingdom, there is neither marrying, nor giving in marriage, but they are as the Angels, in a fixed ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting State, and one continued Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion maketh up the New <hi>Ierusalem</hi>: Being once holy and happy, they are so for ever: But here it is not so: One Generation
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45238:10"/>
cometh, and another goeth: If the Father be as wise as <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Son may be as foolish as <hi>Rehoboam</hi>: O what a great work it is to make a man truly wise and good! How many years study doth it usually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire? What wisdom and diligence in Teachers? What teachableness and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in Learners; and especially the Grace of God! And when all is done, the man quickly dieth, and obtaineth his ends in another world: But his Children are born as ignorant, and perhaps as bad as he was born: He can neither leave them his Knowledge; nor his Grace. They must have all the same teaching, and labour, and blessing as he had, to bring them to the same attainments: The Mercy and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God taketh them into his Church, where they have great advantages and helps, and promiseth them more mercy for their relation to a faithful Parent, if he or they do make no forfeiture of it: But as their Nature is the same with others, so their actual Wisdom must come by Gods blessing on the use of the same means, which are necessary to the Children of the worst men. A Christian's Child is born with no more Knowledge than a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then's, and must have as much labour and study to make him wise.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:45238:10"/>§ 2. It is certain then that the welfare of this world lyeth on a good succession of the several Generations: And that all the endeavours of one Generation, with God's greatest blessing on them, will not serve for the Ages following: All must begin anew, and be done over again, or all will be as undone to the next Age: And it is not the least blessing on the faithful that their faith and godliness disposeth them to have a care of posterity, and to devote their Children wholly to God, as well as themselves, and to educate them in his fear. If Nature had not taught Birds and Beasts to feed their Young, as well as to generate them, their kind would be soon extinct. O what a blessed World were it, if the blessings of men famous for wisdom and godliness, were entailed on all that should spring from them! and if this were the common case!</p>
            <p n="3">§ 3. But the doleful miseries of the World have come from the degenerating of good mens posterity. <hi>Adam</hi> hath his <hi>Cain,</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> his <hi>Cham,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> his <hi>Absalom; Solomon, Hezekiah, Iosiah,</hi> left not their like behind them. The present State of the Eastern Churches is a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful instance. What places on Earth were more honourable for Faith and Piety, than
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45238:11"/>
               <hi>Alexandria, Antioch, Ierusalem, Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, Ephesus, Philadelphia,</hi> and the rest of those great and noble Countries; and these also strengthened with the powerfullest Christian Empire that ever was on Earth: And now they are places of Barbarism, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and foolish Mahometanism, where the Name of Christ is made a scorn, and the few Christians that keep up that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Profession, by Tyranny kept in so great Ignorance, that, alas! the vices of most of them dishonour their Profession, as much as their Enemies Persecutions do. O what a doleful difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that great part of the World now, and what it was 1400 or 1000 years ago?</p>
            <p>And alas! were it not for the name of a pompous Christian-Church, how plain an instance would <hi>Rome</hi> be of the same Dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy? And some Countries that received the blessing of Reformation, have revolted into the darkness of Popery. What a change was in <hi>England</hi> by Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign? And how many particular Cities &amp; Towns are grown ignorant and malignant, which in former times were famous for Religion? The Lord grant it may never be the case of <hi>London</hi>! Yea, how many persons of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and great Families have so far degenerated from the famous Wisdom
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45238:11"/>
and Piety of their Grandfathers, yea and Fathers, as to hate that which their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents loved, and persecute those whom their Ancestors honoured. The names of many Great men stand honoured in Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, for their Holiness to God, and their Service to their Countries, whose posterity are the men that we are most in danger of: Alas! in how few such houses hath Piety kept any long succession; yea, some take their Fathers virtues to be so much their dishonour, that they turn malignant Perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors, to free themselves from the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed reproach of their Relations. Yea, some Preachers of the Gospel, devoted to God by pious Parents, become Revilers of their own Parents, and despisers of their Piety, as the effect of factious Ignorance.</p>
            <p n="4">§ 4. And on the other side, when Piety hath successively as a River kept its course, what a blessing hath it proved? (But how rare is that?) And when Children have proved better than their Parents, it hath been the beginning of welfare to the places where they lived. How marvellously did the Reformation prevail in <hi>Germany</hi> in <hi>Luther</hi>'s time, when God brought out of Popish Monasteries many excellent Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Service? And Princes became wise and pious, whose Parents had been
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45238:12"/>
blind or impious? Godliness or wickedness, welfare or calamity, follow the changes and quality of posterity.</p>
            <p>And men live so short a time, that the work of Educating Youth aright, is one half the great business of man's Life: He that hath a Plantation of Oaks, may work for twenty Generations: But he that planteth Gardens and Orchards with Plants that live but a little time, must be still planting, watering, and defending them.</p>
            <p n="5">§ 5. Among the Antient Sages of the World, the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> and much more among the <hi>Israelites,</hi> the care of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, and publick welfare, was the great thing which differenced the virtuous and laudable, from those of a base, selfish, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual disposition. He was the bravest Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> that did most love, and best serve his Country: And he was the Saint among the Jews, who most loved <hi>Sion,</hi> and the Security and Succession of its ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and peaceable posterity. And the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Faith, and Hope, and Interest, doth lead us herein to a much higher pitch, and to a greater zeal for publick good, in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him that whipt out prophaners from the Temple; even a zeal of God's House, which eateth us up: It teacheth us by the Cross most effectually to deny our
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:45238:12"/>
selves, and to think nothing too dear to part with, to edifie the Church of God; nor any labour or suffering too great for common good. It teacheth us to pray for the <hi>Hallowing of God's Name, the Coming of his Kingdom, and the doing of his Will on Earth, as it is done in Heaven, before our daily Bread,</hi> and any other personal Interest of our own. Therefore the Families of Christians should be as so many Schools, or Churches, to train up a succession of persons meet for the great communicative works which God calleth all Believers to, in their several measures: It is <hi>eminently Teachers,</hi> but it is also <hi>all others</hi> in their several ranks, who must be the <hi>Salt of the Earth, and the Lights of the World.</hi> And indeed the Spirit of <hi>Holiness</hi> is so eminently the Spirit of <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and Man, that it inclineth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very sanctified person to a Communicative Zeal, to make others wise, and good, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hink that it consisteth in that which it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:45238:13"/>
doth not; yet still the general desire of their Childrens well-fare, as well as of their own, is deeply rooted, and will work for their well-fare, as soon as they well know wherein it doth consist. And God hath not given them this Love only for the good of the individual Children; but much more for the Common-Wealth, and Church, that as many sticks make one fire, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny exercised Souldiers one Army, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny well educated Children, may make up one peaceable and holy Society.</p>
            <p n="7">§ 7. And accordingly it is much to be observed, that God hath not given Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren a natural Love and submissiveness to Parents, only for the personal benefit of their provision, and other helps; but es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially that hereby they may be teacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and obedient to those Instructions of their Parents, by which they may become Blessings in their Generations, and may conjunctly make up wise and holy Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Families, Churches, and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths. For these ends it is, that God hath bound you, as to reverence your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, Tutors and Pastors, so especially both to reverence and love your Parents, that you may be the more capable of their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Instruction and Advice.</p>
            <p n="8">§ 8. Yea, the great strictness of God, in
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45238:13"/>
condemning Polygamy, Adultery and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, seemeth to be especially for the securing of the good Education of Children, for their Souls, and for the publick good: For it is notorious, that confusion in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages and Generation, would many ways tend to the depraving of humane Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, while Mothers had not the necessary encouragement to perform their part: The younger Women would be a while esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and afterward be cast off, and made most miserable, and Families be like wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring beggars, or like exposed Orphans<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Disorder, and Confusion would deprive Children of much of their necessary helps, and Barbarousness and bruitishness corrupt Mankind.</p>
            <p>By all this it is most evident, that the great means of the wellfare of the World, must be the faithful and holy endeavours of Parents, and the willing teachableness <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd obedience of Children, that they may escape the snares of folly and fleshly Lusts, and may betimes get that Wisdom and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <head>CHAP. IV. How the Case standeth with our Youth in matter of Fact.</head>
            <p n="1">§ 1. THrough the great mercy of God, many Families are sacred Nurse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for Church and Kingdom; and many Parents have great comfort in the Grace of God appearing in their Children. From their early Childhood many are of humble, obedient Dispositions, and have a love to Knowledge, and a love to the word of God, and to those that are good and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous persons. They have inward convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the evil of Sin, and a fear of sinning, and a great dislike of wicked persons, and a great Love and reverend Obedience to their Parents, and when they grow up, they diligently learn in private, and in publick: They increase in their love to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and good Books, and to Godly teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and godly Company, and God saveth them from temptations, and worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, and fleshly Lusts, and they live to God, and are blessings to the Land, the joy of their Friends, and exemplary and useful to those whom they converse with.</p>
            <p n="2">§ 2. But all, even religious Parents have
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45238:14"/>
not the like blessing in their Children. 1. Some of them, though religious other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, are lamentably careless of the duty which they promised to perform (at Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism) in the education of their Children, and do but superficially and formally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct them, and are too faulty as to the Example which they should give them, and seem to think that God must bless them, because they are theirs, and because they are baptised, while they neglect their promised Endeavours. 2. And some Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren when they grow up, and are bound to resist temptations, and to use Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed means for their own good, do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully resist Gods Grace, and run into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and neglect, and wretchedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray themselves, and forfeit the mercies which they needed.</p>
            <p n="3">§ 3. In all my observation God hath most blessed the Children of those Parents, who have educated them as followeth: 1. Those that have been particularly sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible what they promised for them in the Baptismal Vow, and made Conscience of performing it. 2. Those that have had more care of their Souls than of their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Wealth. 3. Those that have been most careful to teach them the pravity of corrupted nature by original sin, and to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45238:15"/>
humble them and teach them the need of a Saviour, and his renewing as well as pardoning Grace, and to tell them the work of the Spirit of Sanctification, and teach them above all to look to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward state of their Souls. 4. Those that have most seriously minded them of death, judgment, and the Life to come. 5. Those that have always spoken of God with the greatest reverence, affection and delight. 6. Those that have most wisely laboured to make all the knowledge and practice of Religion pleasant unto them, by the suitableness of Doctrines and Duties to their capacity. 7. Those that have most disgraced sin to them, especially base and fleshly pleasures. 8. Those that have kept them from the baits of sensuality, not gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying their appetites in meats and drink, to bring them to an unruly habit; but used them to a habit of temperance, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of appetite. 9. Those that have most disgraced worldliness and Pride to them, and used them so low things in Apparel and Possession, and told them how the proud are hateful to God, and set before them the example of a crucified Christ, and opened to them the Doctrine of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and self-denial, and the great necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of true humility. 10. Those that have
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45238:15"/>
been most watchful to know their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens particular inclinations and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and apply answerable remedies, and not carelesly leave them to themselves. 11. Those that have been most careful to keep them from ill Company, especially, (1.) Of wicked Youths, of their own grouth and neighbourhood, (2.) And of tempting Women. 12. Those that have most wisely used them to the meetest pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Teachers, and help them to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and understand what they hear, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the fundamental truths in the Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism. 13. Those that have most wisely engaged them into the familiarity and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent converse of some suitable, godly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Companions. 14. Those that have most conscionably spent the Lords days in publick and in their families. 15. Those that have done all this, as with reverend gravity, so especially with tender, endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love to their Children, convincing them, that it is all done for their own good: And that do not by imprudent weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses ignorance, passions, or scandal, fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate their own Endeavours. 16. Those that use not their Children as meer pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, only to hear what their Parents say; but ingage them to constant Endeavours of their own, for their own good; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:45238:16"/>
in the reading of Scripture, and the most suitable Books, and meditating on them, and daily personal Prayer to God. 17. Lastly, Those that pray most heartily and believingly for Gods Grace and his Blessing on their endeavours: Such mens Children are usually blessed.</p>
            <p n="4">§ 4. But it is no wonder, where such means are neglected, much more when Parents are ungodly, fleshly, worldly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and perhaps Enemies to a holy life, if the Children of such are ignorant, delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ungodly, and drown'd in fleshly Lusts. And, alas! it is the multitude of such, and their sad conditions, which is the occasion of my writing this Epistle.</p>
            <p n="5">§ 5. 1. We see, to our grief, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Children are of a stupid and unteachable disposition, and almost uncapable of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, who yet can as quickly learn to talk of common matters, as other persons, and can as easily learn a Trade, or how to do any ordinary business. And though some inconsiderate persons overlook the causality of the more immediate Parents sins, in such judgments on their Children, as if it were only <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin that hurt them, I have elsewhere proved, that this is their great and dangerous mistake. As <hi>David</hi>'s Child dyed for the Fathers sin, the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45238:16"/>
Children of Gluttons, Drunkards, Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, oft contract such bodily distempers, as greatly tend to stupifie or further vitiate the mind. And their Souls may have sad ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to the common humane pravity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Accordingly many Children have more violent passions, and carnal desires, than others, which run them into wicked ways impetuously, as if they were almost bruits that had no reason or power to resist. And all words and corrections are to them of little force, but they are as blocks, that when you have said and done what you can, go away as if they had not heard you.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And some have cross and crooked na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, addicted to that which is naught, and the more, by how much the more you do contradict them: Froward and obstinate, as if it were a desirable Victory to them, to overcome their Parents, and escape all that would make them wise and good: Dogged, sour, proud, self-willed, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly disobedient.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And too many have so great an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and aversness to all that is holy, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and heavenly, that they are weary to hear you talk of it, and you persuade them to learn, to read, to pray, to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, or consider, as you persuade a sick man to the meat which he doth loath,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:45238:17"/>
or a man to dwell with those that he hateth. They have no appetite to such things; no pleasure in them; when you have said all of God, and Christ, and Glory, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it not, or they savour it not: They are things above their reach and love, yea, things against their carnal minds: You tire them worse than if you talk'd in a strange Language to them, such enmity is in the heart of corrupted man to God and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, till the Grace of the great Reconciler overcome it by a new Life, and Light and Love.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And when custom is added to all these vicious dispositions, alas, what slaves and drudges of Satan doth it make them! For instance,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some are so corrupted with the <hi>Love of sport,</hi> that <hi>gaming</hi> or <hi>Stage-plays,</hi> or one such foolery or another, becometh so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant to them, that they can understand or believe nothing that is said against it by God or man; their diseased Phantasie hath so conquered reason, that they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain themselves; but in their callings and in religious Exercises they are weary, and long to be at their sports, and must be gone; neither God, nor Holiness, nor the Joys of Heaven are half so sweet to their thoughts as these are: For they have that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45238:17"/>
mark of misery, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3 4. <hi>They are lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The same I say of <hi>sinful mirth,</hi> and the company which doth cherish it. Little do they believe <hi>Solomon,</hi> Eccles. 7.2, 3, 4. <hi>It is better to go to the House of Mourning, than to go to the House of Feasting: For that is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart. Sorrow is better than Laughter: For by the sadness of the Countenance the Heart is made better: The Heart of the wise is in the House of Mourning, but the Heart of fools is in the House of Mirth. It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the Song of fools: For as the crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Thorns under a Pot, so is the Laughter of Fools.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's true, that Mirth is very desirable to nature: And God is not against it, but much more for it than sinners will believe: But it is a rational Mirth which beseemeth a rational Creature; and such as he can justifie, and as will make him better, and tends to felicity, and everlasting mirth; and not the causeless mirth of mad men, that set their house on fire, and then laugh and sing over it, nor like the mirth of a drunken man, whose shame exposeth him to pitty or derision, nor any such mirth as leadeth a man from God to sin, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45238:18"/>
him from the way of man-like and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting joy, and prepareth for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est sorrows.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There are some so enslaved to their <hi>Appetites,</hi> that their Reason hath no power to rule them; but like bruits they must needs have what the Belly and Throat de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire: And if they be the Children of the Rich, who have always <hi>full</hi> and <hi>pleasant</hi> food, constant flesh-pleasing, and true Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, is taken for no sin; and like Swine, they do but <hi>live to eat,</hi> whereas they should but eat to live, and chearfully serve God.</p>
            <p>But it's never so dangerous as when it turneth to the <hi>love of drink</hi>; Then the pleasing of the Throat, &amp; the pleasing of the Brain by mirth going together, do so much corrupt the appetite and fantasie, that their thoughts run after it, and reason hath no power to shut their Mouths, nor keep them from the House of Sin. Some sin against an accusing Conscience, and under their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions and Terrors do drink on, which yet they could forbear, if they knew there were Poison in the Cup. Some are more miserable, and have sinned themselves into fearedness of Conscience, and past feeling, and perhaps into infidelity, and a blinded mind, persuading them that there is no great harm or danger in the Sin, and that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45238:18"/>
it is but some precise people that make so great a matter of it: And some that have purposes to forsake the sin, when appetite stirs forget it all; and when Company en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticeth, and when they see the Cup, they have no power to forbear. O what a pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful sight it is, to see men in the flower of Youth and Strength, when they should most rejoyce in God and Holiness, to be still thirsty after a forbidden pleasure, and hast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Tavern or Alehouse, as a Bird to the snare of the Fowler, and sweetly and greedily swallowing the poisonous Cup which God forbiddeth! And that false Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance which Conscience and Experience force them to sometimes, is forgotten the next day when the temptation is renewed: Yea, the <hi>Throat-madness,</hi> and the <hi>merry</hi> and <hi>Belly-Devils</hi> are within them a continual temptation, which the miserable slaves cannot resist.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And these beastly, fleshly sins, do u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually make them weary of their callings, and of any honest labour: The Devil hath by this time got possession of their thoughts, by the byass of Delight and sinful Lust; and they are thinking of Meat, or Drink, or Play, or merry Company, when they should be diligently at work: And so Idleness be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the nursery of Temptation, and of
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45238:19"/>
all their other vice, as well as a constant sin of Omission, and loss of hasty precious time. And custom increaseth the habits, and maketh them good for nothing, and like dead men to all that life is given them for, and only alive to prepare by sin for endless misery.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And usually <hi>Pride</hi> also takes its part, to make the sin of <hi>Sodom</hi> in them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.49. <hi>Pride, Fulness, and Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> They that must be in their jovial Company, must not seem despicable among them, but must be in the mode and fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, what ever it cost. When they make themselves odious in the sight of God, and the pitty of all wise men, and a terror to themselves, yet they must be some body to their sottish Companions, especially of the Female Sex: Lest the Image of the Devil, and his victory over them should not be perfect, if Pride were left out, how unreasonable soever.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And by this time they have (usually here amongst the rich and idle,) a further step towards Hell to go, and yet a deep Gulf to fall into; <hi>Fleshly Lust</hi> next entangleth them in <hi>immodest Converse</hi> with Women, and thence into <hi>filthy Fornication.</hi> The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil will seldom lose a Soul for want of a temptation: Either he will provide them
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45238:19"/>
one abroad among their lewd Companions, or at home some Daughter or servant of the House, where they can oft get oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, first for uncivil sights and touches, and then for actual Fornication. And if they have done it once, they are usually like the Bird that's fast in the Lime-twigs: Conscience may struggle, but Lust holds them fast, and the Devil saith, <hi>If once may be pardoned, why not twice, and if twice, why not thrice; and so they go on as an Ox to the Slaughter, and a fool to the correction of the Stocks, and know not that it is for their lives.</hi> Prov. 7.21, 22, 23. <hi>Till they mourn at last</hi> (perhaps) <hi>when Flesh and Body are consumed, and say, How have I hated Instruction, and my heart despised reproof, and have not obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the voice of my Teachers, nor inclined my Ears to them that instructed me? I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in all evil,</hi> &amp;c. Pro. 5.12, 13, 14. And it's well for the wretches if this Repentance be true and in time, that though the Flesh be destroyed, the Spirit may be saved: For <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.18, 19. <hi>Her house en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth to death, and her paths to the dead: None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of Life.</hi> God, I doubt not, recovereth some, but the case is dangerous: For though Age and Sickness cure Lust, usually before that the Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45238:20"/>
is seared and debauched, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>past feeling</hi> work <hi>Vncleanness with gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness,</hi> and forsaking God are so forsaken by him, that all other Sin, Sensuality, and Enmity against a holy life prevaileth against them, and the unclean Devil lets in many more. Most debauched Drunkards, Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons and Fornicators are so enslaved to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, that they think, say, and do what he would have them, and become the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Persecutors of those that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their sin, and the blinded <hi>Sodomites</hi> go on to grope for the door of <hi>Lot,</hi> as one that reproveth them, till the Flames of Justice stop the rage.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And when all these sins have enslaved sensual Youths, they must have Money to maintain them; and if they have it not of their own, and be not the Sons of great men, that will maintain them in the service of the Flesh, they must steal to get it, which usually is either by thievish borrowing when they cannot pay, or by robbing their Parents or Masters. If all the Masters in <hi>London</hi> knew what Thieves their Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices vices are, for their own sakes they would take greater care to watch over them, and keep them from ill company, Drunkenness and Plays, and would teach them to seek pleasure in good Books, good
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:45238:20"/>
Company, and serving God. I had not known it my self, if the <hi>Confessions</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> of many penitent Converts had not made me know it. I thank God that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covereth any, yea, so many; but I must tell foolish Youth, that <hi>Repentance</hi> itself, especially when it must have <hi>Restitution,</hi> is so bitter, that they would prevent that need of it, if they had but the use of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and foresight. O what heart-tearing Confessions, and sad Letters have I had from many young Apprentices in this City<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Much adoe to escape utter despair they had, when Conscience was awakened to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member all their sin and danger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And when they knew that they must restore, if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, all that ever they deceived or robbed their Masters or any others of; O what difficulties hath it put them to, both as to the shame of Confession, and the actual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution! Some have not Money; and to go and confess the sin and debt, and promise to pay it if ever they are able, seemeth hard, but must be done. Some have rough Masters that will disgrace them when they confess it. Some have Parents that paid dear to set them Apprentices, and would go near to cast them off if they knew their case. Some marry after, and it will grieve their Wives to know what they have been,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:45238:21"/>
and how much they must restore. Wisdom might have prevented this; but if the Thorn be got into the Conscience, it must come out, and if the poison be swallowed, it must come up, what gripes soever the Vomit cost. There is no playing with Hell fire, nor jeasting with the Justice of the most Holy God. One penitent review of fleshly Lust, and sinful pleasure, and fals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and deceit, (though wholsom if true and rimely) will turn it all into Gall and Wormwood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For the end of sinful mirth is sorrow.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And too many there be that escape the gross and disgraceful part of the foresaid sensuality and unrighteousness, that yet do but choose another Idol, and set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves wholly to rise in the World, and Riches, Preferment, and Honour have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all their hearts and care: That have no delight in God and holiness; nor doth the state of their Souls, or the thought of their everlasting state, affect them in any measure, according to its unspeakable weight, nor so much as these shadows which, they pursue. And when great Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, that have seen much of the world, and old men, and dying men, that have had all that it can do, are forced by experience to call all <hi>Vanity</hi> and <hi>Vexation,</hi> unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45238:21"/>
Youth, that are taken up with the hopes of long prosperity, and provision for all that the Flesh desireth, have other thoughts of it, and will not know that it is deceitful Vanity, till it hath deceived them of their chiefest Hope and Treasure. And when they have overtaken the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow which they pursue so greedily, they find it what others have done before them, the sweeter the more dangerous, and the parting will be the more bitter: Whereas had they sought first Gods Kingdom and its Righteousness, and six days laboured in obedience to God, and referred all corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Blessings to spiritual uses, and everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ends, taking them as from God to serve him by them, they might have had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough as an overplus to their satisfying Treasure.</p>

            <head>CHAP. V. How sad a Case it is that I have described.</head>
            <p>I Have told you the very lamentable case of too many young men, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally rich mens Sons, and Apprentices in this City: I told you before of what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the state of Youth is to themselves and others. From thence (and alas from sad experience) it's easy to gather the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of the case of those that are drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in fleshly Lust, and have sinned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into the guilt and danger which I have described. But I will name some parts of the misery more particularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p n="1">§ 1. Review the second Chapter, and think what a doleful case this is to <hi>your selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Do you not know that you are not Beasts but Men? that have reason given them to know, and love, and serve their Maker? And how sad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is it to see a man forget all this, and wilfully brutify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Were the Poets fictions true of men turned into Trees, and Birds, and Beasts,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:45238:22"/>
how small were the misery in comparison of yours. It is no sin in Bruits to lust, or to eat and drink too much. They have not reason to restrain and rule them; but lest they should kill themselves by excess, God hath made reasonable man their Governor, and moderateth their Appetite in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of their natures: But for a reasonable Creature to subject himself to fleshly Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and wilfully degrade his Soul to the rank of Bruits, is worse than if he had been made with the Body and the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness of Bruits. Are you capable of no better things than these?</p>
            <p n="2">§ 2. And what an odious thing is it, when God hath chosen you out of the World to be members of his visible Church, and given you the great priviledge of ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Entrance into his holy Covenant, and washt you in the laver of visible Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and you are vowed to Christ, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the Lusts of the Flesh, the World and the Devil, that you might follow a Crucified Christ in the way of holiness to everlasting Life, that you should so soon prove false, perfidious Traitors and Rebels against him that is your only hope, and by wickedness and Covenant breaking, make your sin greater than that of Infidels, Turks and Heathens, that never were taken into
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:45238:23"/>
the Church and Covenant of Christ, nor ever broke the Vows which you have broken, nor so cast away the mercys which you had received.</p>
            <p n="3">§ 3. And what a doleful case is it, that so much of your Minds, and Love, and Delight, which were all made for God, should be so misimployed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even in your strength when they should be most vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous? and all worse than cast away on filth and folly? If your Souls be more worth than your Money, it is more folly and loss to misimploy and abuse your Souls, your Reason, Love, and your Delight, than to abuse or cast away your Money. And what a Traitor or Murderer deserveth, that would give his Money to hire one to kill the King, or his Neighbour, I suppose you know; and what deserveth he that will use not only his mony, but himself, his soul, his thoughts, his love, his desire and pleasure against the most glorious God that made him. That you cannot hurt him is no thanks to you; while you break his Laws, and deny him your Love and Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and love more that one thing which only he hateth, and will never be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to.</p>
            <p n="4">§ 4. And how doleful a case is it, that all the Care, and Love, and Labour of your
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45238:23"/>
Parents, Masters, and Teachers should be lost upon you? God hath made all this their great Duty for your good; and will you despise God and them, and wilfully for nothing reject it all? Shall all the pain of a Child-bearing Mother, and all her trouble and labour to breed you up, and all your Parents care to provide for you, be but to breed up a slave for the Flesh, the World, and the Devil, and a firebrand for Hell? Shall godly Parents Prayers for you, and Teaching, and Counsel of you, and all their desire and care for your Salvation, be despised by you, and all forgotten and cast away for a swinish Lust?</p>
            <p n="5">§ 5. And how doleful a case is it, that so much of so short a Life should be lost, and a thousand times worse than lost; even turned into sin, to prepare for misery, when alas the longest Life is little enough for our important work, and quickly gone, and the Reckoning and Judge are hard at hand? All the Wealth, Wit or Power in the World, cannot bring or buy you back one hour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of all that precious time, which you now so basely cast away. O how glad would you be of a little of it ere long, on the tearms that now you have it, when you lie dying, and perceive that your souls are unready to appear before a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45238:24"/>
God! Then O for one year more of precious time! O that you knew how to call again the time which you cast away on sin! You will then perceive with a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Conscience, that time was not so little worth as you once thought it, nor given you for so base a work; yea, if God in mercy bring you hereafter to true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, O how it will wound your hearts, to think how much of your Youth was so madly cast away, while your God, your Souls, and everlasting hopes, were all neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and despised!</p>
            <p n="6">§ 6. And alas, if you should be cut off in that unholy, miserable Estate, no heart on earth can sufficiently bewail your case! How many thousand die young, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised themselves longer pleasure in sin, and Repentance after it? O foolish sinners! Cannot you so long borrow the use of your reason, as to think seriously whither you must go next? Do you never think when the small Pox or a Feaver hath taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way one of your Companions, whither it is that his Soul is gone? Have you your Wit for nothing but to taste the sweetness of Drink or Lust, which is as pleasant to a Dog or Swine as to you? O little you know what it is to die! what it is for a Soul to leave the Body, and enter into
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45238:24"/>
an endless World! To come to judgment for all his sins, and all his ill spent days and hours, and for choosing the pleasures of a Swine before Heaven, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of a Saint. Little know you what it is for Devils presently to take away to Hell a wretched Soul which they have long deceived. I tell you the thought of appearing before God, and Christ, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in another World, and entring on an endless state, is so dreadful, even to many that have spent their lives in holy prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and are indeed in a safe Condition, that they have much ado to overcome the terror of Death. Even some of Gods own faithful Servants are almost over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, when they think of so great a change: And though the belief of God's Love and the heavenly Glory do support them, and should make them long to be with Christ, yet, alas, Faith is weak, and the Change is great beyond our Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, and therefore feared. O then in what a Case is a wicked, unpardoned, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared Wretch, when his guilty soul must be torn from his Body, and dragged in terror to hear its doom, and so to the dreadful Execution? Sinners! Is this a light matter to you? Doth it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern you? Are you not here mortal? Do
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:45238:25"/>
you not know what Flesh is, and what a Grave is? And are not your abused Souls immortal? Are you so mad as to forget this? Or so bad as not to believe it? Will your not believing it make void the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and the Law of God, and save you from that Hell, which only believing could have saved you from? Will not the fire burn you, or the Sea drown you, if you can but run into it drunk or winking? Is <hi>feeling, remediless feeling</hi> easier than <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi> God in time? Alas! What should your believing Friends do to save you? They see by Faith whither you are post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: They foresee your terror and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done case; and fain, if possible, they would prevent it: But they cannot do it without you. If you will not consent and help your selves, it is not the holyest nor wisest Friends in the World that can help you. They would pull you out of the fire in fear, and out of the mouth of the roaring Lion, but you will not be delivered! They call and cry to you, <hi>O fear God, and turn to him while there is hope</hi>; and you will not let Conscience and Reason be awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but those that go asleep to Hell, will be past sleeping there for ever. O run not madly into the everlasting Fire.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:45238:25"/>§ 7. And indeed your sleepy security and presumption doth make your case more dangerous in itself, and more pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to all that know it. O what a sight is it to see a man go merry and laughing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards damnation, and make a jeast of his own undoing? To see him at the brink of Hell, and will not believe it? Like a mad man boasting of his Wit, or a drunken man of his Sobriety: Or as the Swine is delighted when the Butcher is shaving his Throat to cut it: Or as the fatted Lambs are skipping in the pasture, that to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row must be kill'd and eaten: Or as the Bird sits singing when the Gun is levelled to kill him: Or as the greedy Fish runs striving which shall catch the Bait, that must presently be snatched out of her Element, and lie dying on the Bank.</p>
            <p>But because I touch'd much of this in the second Chapter, I will pass by the rest of your own Concerns, and a little further consider how sad the case of such wretched Youths is also unto others.</p>
            <p n="8">§ 8. And if Parents be wise and godly, and understand such Childrens case, what a grief must it needs be to their hearts, to think that they have begot and bred
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:45238:26"/>
up a Chlld for Sin and Hell, and cannot make him willing to prevent it? To see their Counsel set at nought, their Teaching lost, their Tears despised, and an obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Lad seem wiser to himself than all his Teachers, even when he is swallowing the Devil's Bait, and cruelly murdering his own Soul. [Ah! thinks a believing Father and Mother, have I brought thee into the World for this? Hath all my tender, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Love so sad an issue? Is this the fruit of all my sorrows, my care, and kindness, to see the Child of my Bowels, whom I dedicated in Baptism to Christ, to make himself the Child of the Devil, the Slave of the Flesh and World, the Enemy of God and Holiness, and his own destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er? and all this wilfully, obstinately and against all the Counsel, and means that I can use. Alas! must I breed up a Child to become an Enemy to the Church of God, into which he was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized? and a Souldier for Satan against Christ? Must I breed up a Child for Hell, and see him miserable for ever? and cannot persuade him to be willing to be saved.] O what a heart breaking must this be to those, that Nature and Grace have taught to love them, with tenderness, even as themselves!</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:45238:26"/>§ 9. But if they be wicked Parents, and as bad themselves, the misery is far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, though they yet feel it not: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. As the Thief on the Cross said to his Companion, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.40, 41. <hi>Thou art in the same Condemnation, and we suffer just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds.</hi> Wicked Parents, and wicked Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are in the same Gall of bitterness and Bond of Iniquity! They sinned together, and they must suffer for ever together, if true Faith and Conversion do not prevent it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And it is their wickedness which was much of the cause of their Childrens sin and misery: And their own deep guilt will be more to them than their Childrens suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering: God and Conscience will say to them ere long,
<q>[O cruel Parents! that had no mercy on your Children, or your selves! What did Nature teach you to love more, than <hi>your selves</hi> and <hi>your Children</hi>? And would you wilfully and obstinately be the ruine of both? You would not have done as the mad Idolaters, that offered their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in fire to <hi>Moloch</hi>: And will you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them by sin to Satan and to Hell? Had a Serpent stung them, or a Bear
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:45238:27"/>
devoured them, they had done but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Nature: But was it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural in you to further their damnation? This was work too bloody for a <hi>Canni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal,</hi> too cruel for an Enemy, fitter for a Devil than a Father or Mother. As your Child had from you his vicious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it was your part to have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured his Sanctification and Recovery: You should have taught him betime to know the corruption of his nature, and to seek and beg the Grace of Christ; to know his God, his duty, the evil of sin, the danger of temptations, and his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting hopes and fears: You should have taught him to know what man hath done against himself, by disobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and departing from his God, and what Jesus Christ hath done for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and what he himself must do to be saved: You should have taught him early how to live, and how to die, and what to seek, and what to shun: You should have given him the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a holy and heavenly mind and life: You should have watch'd over him for his safety, and unweariedly instructed him for his Salvation: But you led him the way to despise God's Word, and set light by Christ, and Holiness, and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:45238:27"/>
to hate Instruction and Reproof, to spend the Lords day in idleness or world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vanity, and to seek first the World, and the prosperity of the Body, and glut the Flesh with sinful pleasure. What wonder if a Serpent breed a Serpent, and quickly teach him to hiss and sting, and if Swine teach their young to feed on dung and wallow in the mire? This is part of the fruit of your worldliness, fleshliness, ungodliness, and neglect of your own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Salvation and your Childs. Now he is as you are, a slave of sin, and an heir of Hell: Was this it that you vowed him for to God in Baptism? Was it to serve the Flesh, the World, and the Devil, against our God, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and our sanctifier? Or did the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake of the Liturgy deceive you, to think that it was not you, but the God-Fathers, that were bound by Charge and Vow to bring him up in the Faith and Fear of God, and teach him all that a Christian should know for his Soul's Health: Was it not you that God bound to all this? The sin and misery of your Child now is so far your curse, as you are guilty of it and will add to your mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for ever.]</q>
Such are the sorrows that wicked Parents and wicked Children
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:45238:28"/>
do prepare, and heap on one another. Such miseries will come; but woe to those by whom they come, it had been good for that man that he had never been born.</p>
            <p n="10">§ 10. And it is no small grief to faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ministers, to see their labour so much lost; and to see so much evil among their flocks, and such sad Prognosticks of worse to come. He is no true Minister of Christ (as to his own acceptance and Salvation) whose heart is not set on the winning, and sanctifying, and saving of Souls. What else do we study for, preach for, live for, long for, suffer for in our Work? All faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful-Teachers can say with <hi>Paul,</hi> that they are <hi>willing to spend and be spent for them, and now we live if ye stand fast in the Lord.</hi> 2 Cor. 12.15. 1 Thes. 3.8. <hi>He told them weeping of those that were Enemies to the Cross of Christ, whose God was their Belly, who glory in their shame, and mind earthly things, instead of a Conversation in Heaven.</hi> Phil. 3.18, 19. When God hath blessed us with the comfortable enjoyment of many ancient, holy Christians, who are the beauty and honour of the Assemblies, and Death calls home one of them after another to Christ, and the rest are ready
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:45238:28"/>
to depart: Alas! Must a seed of Serpents come after them? Must those take their places to our grief and shame, who are bred up to the World and Flesh, in Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness, Fornication, and Enmity to God and a holy Life? O what a woful change is this!</p>
            <p>And if any be like to be the stain and Plague of the Church, it is such as these: If we preach holy truth to them, Lust cannot love it: If we tell them of Gods word, the fleshly mind doth not savour it, nor can be subject to it. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5, 6, 7. If we reprove them sharply, they smart and hate us: If we call them to Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Repentance, their Pride and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality cannot bear it: If we excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate them for Impenitency, as Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, or but deny them the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as unmeet, they rage against us as our fiercest Enemies: If we neglect Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and admit Swine to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Saints, we harden and deceive them, and flatter them in their sin, pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute the Church, and endanger our Souls by displeasing the chief Pastor. What then shall we do with these self-murther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ungodly men?</p>
            <p>Many of them have so much Reverence of a Sacrament, or so little regard of it,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:45238:29"/>
that they never seek it, but keep away themselves: Perhaps they are afraid, left they eat and drink damnation to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, by the prophanation of holy things: But do they think, that it is safe to be out of the Church and Communion of Saints, because it's dangerous to abuse it? Are Infidels safe, because false hearted Christians perish? What if breaking your Vows and Covenant be damnable? Is it not so to be out of the holy Covenant? What if God be a consuming fire to those that draw near him in unrepented heinous sin? Is it therefore wise or safe to avoid him? Neither those that come not to him, nor those that come in their hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie and reigning sin shall be saved.</p>
            <p>And yet what to do with these self-sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penders we know not? Are they still Members of the Churches, or are they not? If they are, we are bound to call them to Repentance, for forsaking the Communion of Saints in Christs command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ordinance: If they are not, we should make it known, that Christians and no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians may not be confounded, and they themselves may understand their case. And neither of these can they endure: But for dwelling in the Parish, and hearing the Liturgy and Sermons, must still pass for
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:45238:29"/>
Church Members, lest Discipline should exasperate and further lose them. This is that Discipline which is thought wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the honour of Episcopal Dignity and Revennues, and is supposed to make the Church of <hi>England</hi> the best in the world, by the same men that would rage, were Discipline exercised on them; and must either be admitted to the Sacrament in a life of Fornication, Drunkenness, Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality, and Prophaneness, without any open Confession, Repentance, and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or else must pass for Church Members without any exercise of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, while they shun the Sacramental Communion of the Church. Such work doth wickedness make among us.</p>
            <p n="11">§ 11. Indeed these are the men that are the trouble of Families, the trouble of Neighbours, the trouble of good Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, the shame of bad ones, and the great danger of the Land. All the foreign Enemies whom we talk so much against, and fear, are not so hurtful and dangerous to us as these: These that spring out of your own bowels: These that are bred up with care, and tenderness, and cost in your houses: These that should succeed godly Ancestors in Wisdom and well doing, and be their
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:45238:30"/>
glory. Who plot against us but home bred sinners? Who more hate the good and persecute them? Who are more malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Enemies of Godliness, and scorners of a holy Life, and hinderers of the Word of God, and Patrons of Prophaneness, and of Ministers and People that are of the same mind? If <hi>England</hi> be undone (as the East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Churches, and much of the Western are undone) it will be by your own carnal, ungodly Posterity.</p>
            <p>He that is once a slave to Satan and his fleshly Lust, is ready for preferment, or a reward, to be a slave to the Lust of any other. He that is false to his God and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, after his Baptismal Vows, is unlike to be true to his Country, or his King, if he have but the bait of a strong tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And he that will sell his Soul, his God, and Heaven for a Whore, or for to please his Appetite, it's like will not stick to betray Church, or State, or his dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Friend, for provision to satisfie these Lusts. Can you expect that he should love any man better than himself? A wicked, fleshly, worldly man is a soil for Satan to sow the seeds in, of any sort of actual sin, and is fuel dryed or tinder for the sparks of Hell to kindle in. Will he suffer much for God or his Country, who will sell
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:45238:30"/>
Heaven for nothing? An evil Tree bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth evil Fruit. If he hath the heart of an <hi>Achan,</hi> a <hi>Gehazi,</hi> an <hi>Achitophel,</hi> no wonder if he hath their Actions and their Reward. If he be a Thief and bear the Bag, no wonder if <hi>Iudas</hi> sell his Master.</p>
            <p n="12">§ 12. And these wretches if they live, are like to be a Plague to their own poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: Woe to the Woman that hath such an Husband! And how are the Children like to be bred, that have such a Father? Doth not God threaten punishment to the third and fourth Generation of them that hate him, and to visit the iniquity of the Fathers on the Children? Were not the Children of the old World drowned, and those of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> burned, and <hi>Achans</hi> stoned, &amp; <hi>Dathans</hi> &amp; <hi>Abirams</hi> swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up, and <hi>Gehazi</hi>'s struck with Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for their Fathers sins? And the <hi>Amalekites</hi> Children all destroyed, and the posterity of the Infidel Jews forsaken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Curse coming on them and on their Children? And as their Children are like to speed the worse for such Parents sins, so are such Parents like to be requited by their Children. As you shamed and griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the hearts of your Parents, so may your Children do by you: And by that

            <head>CHAP. VI. The joyful State and Blessing of good Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to themselves and others.</head>
            <p n="1">§ 1. FRom what is said Chap. 2. and 5. it's easie to gather, how joyful a case to themselves, and what a Blessing to Parents and others it is, when Children betime are sober, wise, and godly, and obedient. The difference doth most appear at age, and when they come to bring forth to themselves and others the fruits of their dispositions: And the end and life to come will shew the greatest difference: But yet even here, and that betime, the difference is very great.</p>
            <p n="2">§ 2. I. As to themselves: How blessed a state is it to be quickly delivered from the danger of damnation, and Gods dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure, that they need not lie down and rise in fear, lest they be in Hell whenever Death removeth them from the Body? Can one too soon be out of so dreadful a state? Can one that is in a house on fire, or falln into the Sea, make too much haste to be delivered? If a man deep in debt be
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:45238:32"/>
restless till it be paid, and glad when it is discharged; If a man in danger of sickness or a condemning Sentence of the Judge, be glad when the fear of Death is over; How glad should you be to be safe from the great danger of Damnation? And till you are sanctified by Grace, you are far from safety.</p>
            <p n="3">§ 3. And if a mans Sickness, Pain, or Distraction be a Calamity, the cure of which brings ease and joy; How much more ease and joy may it bring, to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from all the grievous Maladies of reigning sin? Sanctification will cure your minds of spiritual blindness and madness, that is, of damnable Ignorance, Unbelief, and Error: It will cure your affections of idolatrous, distracting, carnal Love; of the itch of fleshly Desires or Lusts; of the feaver of revengeful passions, and malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant hatred to goodness and good men; and of self vexing envy and malice against others; of the greedy worm of Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and the drunken desire of ambitious and imperious minds: It will cure your Wills of their fleshly servitude and biass, and of that mortal Backwardness to God and holy things, and that sluggish dulness and lothness to choose and do what you are convinced must be done: It will make
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:45238:32"/>
good things easie and pleasant to you; so that you will no more think you have need to beg mirth from the Devil, or steal it from sin, as if God, Grace and Glory had none for you: But it will be so easie to you, to love and find pleasure in the Bible and good Books, in good Company and good Discourse, in spiritual Meditations and thoughts, in holy Sermons, Prayers, and Church Communion and Sacraments, even in Christ, in God, and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts of Heaven, that you will be sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ashamed to think that ever you forsook such joys for fleshly pleasure, and defiled your Souls with filthy and forbidden things. And is not the itch of Lust better cured than scratch'd? Is not the feaverish and dropsie thirst after Drink, and Wealth, and Honour, better cured than pleased to the sinners death? And is not a lazy backwardness to Duty, better cured by spiritual health, than pleased with idleness and sleep?</p>
            <p n="4">§ 4. And certainly you cannot too soon attain the delights of Faith and Hope, and Love, of holy Knowledge and Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God and Saints: You cannot too soon have the great blessing of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost; and live night and day in peace of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:45238:33"/>
in assurance that all your sins are pardoned, and that you are the adopted Sons of God, and Heirs of Heaven, sealed by his Spirit, accepted in your Prayers, welcome to God through Christ, and when you die shall be with him: Can you make too great haste from the folly and filth of sin, and the danger of Hell, into so safe and good a state as this?</p>
            <p n="5">§ 5. And it will be a great comfort to you, thus to find at age and use of reason, that your baptismal Blessings ceased not with your Infancy, by your own rejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but that you are now by your own consent in the Bond of God's Covenant, and have a right to all the blessings of it, which the Sacrament of Christs Body and Blood will confirm; as you had your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance by your Parents consent and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted Dedication: For the Covenant of Grace is our certain Charter for Grace and Glory.</p>
            <p n="6">§ 6. And is it not a joy to you to be your Parents joy? To find them love you not only as their Children, but as Gods? Love maketh it sweet to us to please and be beloved by those whom we love. If it be not your grief to grieve your Parents, and your pleasure to please them, you love them not, but are void of natural af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:45238:33"/>§ 7. And O what a mercy will you find it, when you come to age and business in the World! 1. That you come with a clear Conscience, not clogged, terrified, and shamed with the sins of your Youth. 2. And that you come not utterly unfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with the knowledge, Righteousness and Virtue, which you must make use of in every condition all your lives: when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are like Lads, that will go to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities before they can so much as read or write. To live in a Family of your own, and to trade and converse in the World<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and specially to go to Church, to hear, to pray, to communicate, in private to pray, to meditate, in a word, to live or die like a Christian, like a man, without the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture of Wisdom, Faith, and serious God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, is more impossible and unwise, than to go to Sea without Provision, or to War without Arms, or to become a Priest with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Book or understanding.</p>
            <p n="8">§ 8. II. And you that are young men can scarce conceive, what a joy a wise and godly Child is to his wise and godly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents! Read but <hi>Pro.</hi> 10.1 &amp; 13.1. &amp; 17.2, 25. &amp; 19.13, 26. &amp; 27.11. &amp; 23.15, 19, 24, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Prayers and Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of your Parents are comfortable to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:45238:34"/>
them, when they see the happy fruit and answer. They fear not Gods Judgments upon their houses, as they would do if you were <hi>Cains,</hi> or <hi>Chams,</hi> or <hi>Absaloms</hi>: They labour comfortably, and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly leave you their Estates at death, when they see that they do not get and leave it for those that will serve the Devil with it, and consume it on their Lusts; but will use it for God, for the Gospel, and their Salvation: If you fall sick and die before them, they can rejoyce that you are gone to Christ, and need not mourn as <hi>David,</hi> for <hi>Absalom,</hi> that you go to Hell. If you overlive them, they leave the world the easier, when they leave as it were part of themselves here behind them, who will carry on the work of God which they lived for, and be blessings to the world when they are gone.</p>
            <p n="9">§ 9. III. And O what a mercy is it to Church and State, to have our posterity prove better than we have been, and do God more Service than we have done, and take warning by our faults to avoid the like? <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us of one poor wise man that saved a City: And God would have spared <hi>Sodom,</hi> had there been but ten righteous Persons in it. Wherever yet I lived, a few
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:45238:34"/>
persons have proved the great blessings of the place; to be Teachers, Guides, and Exemplary to others, as the little Leaven that leaveneth the Lump, and as the Stomach, Liver, and other nutritive parts are to the Body. Blessed is that Church, that City, that Country, that Kingdom, that hath a wise, and just, and holy People. The nearest good and evil are the greatest: Our Estates are not so near us as Wives and Children, nor they so near us as our Bodies, nor they so much to us as our Souls: It's more to a Person, House, or Country, what they are, than what they have, or what others do for them or against them.</p>
            <p>It is these that are Gods Children as well as ours, that are the Blessing so often mentioned in the Scripture, who will as the <hi>Rechabites</hi> obey their Fathers wholsom Counsels, rather than their Lusts and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Companions, and God before all: <hi>Who walk not in the Counsel of the Vngodly, nor stand in the way of Sinners, nor sit in the seat of the scornful: But their Delight is in the Law of the Lord, and in that Law they meditate day and night.</hi> Psal. 1. <hi>Lo, such Children are an heritage of the Lord; such fruit of the Womb is his Reward. They are as Arrows in the hand of a mighty man;
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:45238:35"/>
Happy is the man that hath his Quiver full of them. They shall not be ashamed; but they shall speak with the Enemies in the gate.</hi> Psal. 127.3, 4, 5. Were it not for wise and godly Children to succeed us, Religion, and Peace, and all publick good, would be but as we frail mortals are, like the Grass or Flowers of a few days or years continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and the difference between a Church and no Church, between a Kingdom of Christians and of Infidels, would be but like the difference between our waking and our sleeping time, so short, as would make it the less considerable.</p>

            <p n="1">§ 1. ANd now the Commands of God, the Love of my Country and the Church, the Love of Piety, true Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Peace, and the Love of Mankind, even of your own Souls and Bodies, do all command me to become once more an earnest suiter to the Youth of this Land, especially of <hi>London,</hi> who have hitherto miscarried, and lived a fleshly, sinful life. Thousands such as you are dead in sin, and past our warning, and past all hope and help for ever. Thousands that laught at Judgment and Damnation, are now feeling that which they would not believe. By the great mercy of God it is not yet the case of you who read these words; but how soon it may be, if you are yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sanctified, you little know: O that you knew what a mercy it is to be yet alive, and after so many sins and dangers, to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:45238:36"/>
have one to warn you, and offer you Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and to be yet in possibility, and in a state of hope: In the name of Christ I most earnestly intreat you, a little while trie to use your reason, and use it seriously in retired, sober Consideration, till you have first well perused the whole course of your lives, and remembred what you have done and how: Till you have thought what you have got or lost by sinning, and why you did it, and whether it was justifiable reason which led you to it, and such as you will stand to in your sober thoughts, yea, such as you will stand to before God at last. Consider seriously what comes next, and whither you are going, and whether your life have fitted you for your jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys end, and how your ways will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed ere long, and how they will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to you, and tast at death, Judgment, and in the world to come. Hold on and think soberly a little while, what is in your Hearts, and what is their condition, what you most love, and what you hate, and whether God or sinful pleasure be dearer and more delightful to you, and how you stand affected and related to the World that you are very near. Sure Reason would be Reason if you would but use it, sure Light would come in, if you would not shut
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:45238:36"/>
the Windows, and draw the Curtains on you, and rather choose to sleep in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Is there nothing within you that grudgeth at your folly, and threateneth you for being wilfully besides your selves? If you would but spend one half hour in a day, or a week, in sober thinking whither you are going, and what you have done, and what you are, and what you must shortly see and be; how could you chuse but be deeply offended with your selves, for living like men quite void of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, against your God, against your selves, against all the ends and obligations of life, and this for nothing?</p>
            <p>But it may be the distinctness of your consideration may make it the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual: And if I put my Motives by way of Questions, will you consider them till you have well answered them all.</p>
            <p n="2">§ 2. <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. Are you not fully convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that there is a God of Infinite Power, Knowledge, and Goodness, who is the perfect Governour of all the World? God forbid that any of you should be so bad, so mad, as seriously to doubt of this, which the Devils believe, while they would draw you to Unbelief. To doubt of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect governing God, is to wink and doubt whether there be a Sun; to stop your ears
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:45238:37"/>
against the notorious testimony of Heaven and Earth, and every Creature: You may next doubt whether there be any thing, if you doubt of God: For Atomes and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows are hardlier perceived with certainty, than the Earth, the Heavens, and Sun.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 2. And if you believe that there is a Governing God, do you not believe that he hath Governing Laws or notifications of his Will? and that we owe this God more full, more absolute, exact Obedience, than can be due to any Prince on Earth? And greater love than to our dearest friend, he being infinitely good and Love it self? Can you owe more to your Flesh, or to any, than to your God, that made you men, by whom you have Life, and Health, and time, and all the good that ever you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived? And can you give him too much Love and Obedience? Or can you think that you need to fear being losers by him, and that your faithful Duty should be in vain?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 3. Is it God that needeth you, or you that need him? Can you give him any thing that he wants, or do you want what he hath to give? Can you live an hour without him? Or be kept without him from pain, misery, or death? Is it not for your own need, and your own good, that he requireth your service? Do you know
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:45238:37"/>
what his service is? It is thankfully to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his greatest Gifts: To take his Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines to save your Souls: To feast on his prepared comforts. He calls you to far better and needfuller Obedience for your selves, than when you command your Child to take his meat, or wear his cloaths, or when he is sick, to take a necessary reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And is such Obedience to be refused?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 4. Hath not Nature taught you to love your selves? Surely you cannot be willing to be damned? Nor be indifferent whether you go to Heaven or Hell? And can you believe, that God would set you on that which would do you hurt, and that the Devil is your Friend, and would save you from him? Can you believe that to please your Throat and Lust till death snatch away your Souls to judgment, is more for your own good, than to live here in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and the love of God, and hereafter to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> live for ever in Glory? Do you think you have lived as if you truly loved your selves, or as self destroyers? All the Devils in Hell, or Enemies on Earth, could never have done so much against you, as by your sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suality, ungodliness, and sloth, you have done against your selves. O poor sinner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ever thou wouldst have mercy from God in thy extremity, be intreated to shew some mercy on thy self!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:45238:38"/>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 5. Hath not Nature deeply taught all the World, to make a great difference between <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vice,</hi> between Moral good and evil? If the good and bad do not greatly differ, what makes all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, even the sons of pride, to be so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of being called or accounted bad? and love to be accounted wise and good? How tenderly do most men bear a reproof, or to hear that they do amiss? To be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a wicked man, a lyar, a perjured man, a knave, how ill is it taken by all mankind? This certainly proveth that the Conscience of the great difference between the good and bad, is a common natural notice. And will not God make a greater difference, who better knoweth it than man?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 6. If God had only commanded you Duty, even a holy, righteous, and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber life, and forbidden you the contrary, and had only bid you seek everlasting hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, and made you no promise of it, should you not in reason seek it chearfully in hope? Our folly leadeth us to do much in vain; but God setteth no man on any vain employment: If he do but bid you resist Temptation, mortifie Lust, learn his Word, pray to him, and praise him, you may be sure it is not to your loss: A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward you may be sure of, if you knew not
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:45238:38"/>
what it will be. Yea, if he set you upon the hardest work, or to pass the greatest danger, or serve him at the dearest rate, or lose your Estate for him, and life itself, what reason can fear being losers by obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God? Yea, the dearest service hath the greatest reward: But when he hath moreover ascertained your reward by a Promise, a Covenant, sworn and sealed by his Miracles, by Christs Blood, by his Sacraments, by his Spirit, if yet you will be ungodly because you cannot trust him, you have no excuse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 7 Do you know the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a man and a Bruit? Bruits have no capacity to think of a God, and a Saviour, and a Life to come, and to know Gods Law, and study Obedience, and fear Hell, and sin, nor reason to rule their Appetites and Lusts, nor any hope or joy in foreseen Glory: But man is made capable of all this: And can you think God maketh such noble faculties in vain? Or should we live like Bruits that have none such?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 8. Do you not certainly know that you must die? All the World cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it: You must die. And is it not <hi>near,</hi> as well as <hi>sure?</hi> How swift is time? O how quickly shall we all be at our race and Warfares end? And where then is the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:45238:39"/>
pleasure of Pride, and Appetite, and Lust? Neither the dismal Carkass, nor the dust or bones retain or taste it: And alas the unconverted Soul must pay for it for ever. And can you think that so short a bruitish pleasure, that hath so sure and sad an end, is worthy the grieving of your Friends, the offending God, the hazard of your Souls, the loss of Heaven, and the suffering of Gods justice in Hell for ever. O foolish sinners! I beseech you, think in time how mad a bargain you are making. O what an Exchange! For a filthy Lust or fleshly Pleasure, to sell a God, a Saviour, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, a Soul, a Heaven, and all your hopes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 9, If the Devil or deceivers should make you doubt whether there be any Judgment and Life to come, should not the meer <hi>possibility</hi> and <hi>probability</hi> of such a day and life, be far more regarded by you than all fleshly pleasure, which is certainly short and base. Did you ever hear a man so mad as to say, <hi>I am sure there is no Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or Hell for Souls?</hi> But you are sure that your flesh must not in a dark grave: you are sure that death will quickly put an end to all that this world can afford you: House and Land, and all that now deceive poor worldlings, will be nothing to you:
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:45238:39"/>
No more than if you had never seen them, save the terrible reckoning that the Soul must make. Sport, and Mirth, and Meat, and Drink, and filthy Lusts are ready all to leave you to the final Sentence of your Judge: And is not even an <hi>uncertain hope of Heaven</hi> more worth than <hi>certain tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitory Vanity?</hi> Is not an uncertain Hell to be more feared and avoided<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than the forsaking of these certain trifles and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits? Much more when God hath so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly revealed to us the life to come.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 10. Is it a wise and reasonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, that the righteous God should give that man everlasting Glory, who will not leave his Whores, his Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or the basest vanity, for all his Love, and for all his Mercies, for the sake of Christ, nor for the hopes of all this Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? Heaven is the greatest reward of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, and of the diligent and patient seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of it: Heaven is the greatest gift of the great Love of God: And can you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he will give it to the slaves of the Devil, and to contemning wilful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels? May not you next think that the Devils may be saved? If you say that God is merciful, it's most true; and this will be the unconverted mans damnation, that he would for a base Lust offend so merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:45238:40"/>
a God, and sell everlasting mercy for nothing, and abuse so much mercy all his life. Abused and refused mercy will be the fewel to feed the flames of Hell, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Conscience of the impenitent for ever. Doth not God know his own mercy better than you do? Can he not be merciful, and yet be holy and just? Is the King unmerciful if he make use of Jails and Gallows for Malefactors? It's mercy to the Land to destroy such, as would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy others: The bosom of eternal Love is not a place for any but the holy: The heavenly Paradise is not like <hi>Mahomet's,</hi> a place of Lust and sensual Delights. You blaspheme the most just and holy God, if you make him seem indifferent to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and the unholy, to his faithful Servants and to the despisers of his Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 11. If there <hi>were any possibility,</hi> that unsanctified Souls should be sanctified and saved in another World, is it not a madness to cast everlasting life upon so great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty or improbability, when we have life, and time, and helps to make our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation sure? God hath called you to give all diligence to make it sure, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. He hath made infallible promises of it, to sanctified Believers: He calleth you to examine and judge your selves, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:45238:40"/>
13.5. And do you know the difference between <hi>certainty</hi> and <hi>uncertainty</hi> in so great a case? O none can now sufficiently conceive what a difference there is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Soul that is going out of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with joyful assurance that Christ will presently receive him, and a Soul that in the guilt of sin, must say, I am going to an endless life, and know not but it may be an endless misery! I am here now, and know not but I may be presently with Devils that here deceived me: Just fear of passing presently to Hell fire, is a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful case, to be avoided above all earthly sufferings. <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.4. and 14.33. Much more when Gods threatnings to the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent are most sure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 12. Do you think in your hearts that you have more pleasure, and sound content, and peace with your Whores, and in your Sports, and Drink, or Riches, than true Believers have in God, in Christ, in a holy life, and the hopes of everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glory? Judge but by the cause: Is not the Love of that God that is the Lord of Life, and Death, and all, and the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of pleasing him, and the sense of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and mercy through Christ, and the firm expectation of endless joy, by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of God, sealed by his Son, his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:45238:41"/>
and his Spirit; I say, is not all this matter more worthy to rejoyce a Soul, than Money, and Meat, and Drink, and Lust? Have not you those secret gripes of Conscience, when you think how short the sport will be, and that for all these things you must come to judgment, which much abateth the pleasure of your sin? Had you spent that time in seeking first the Kingdom of God and its Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and in honest, obedient labouring in your callings, you need not have lookt back on it with the gripes of an accusing Conscience. If you see a true Believer sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, it is not for serving and obeying God, or being holy and hating sin; but for serving God no better, and hating sin no more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 13. Have you not oft secret wishes in your hearts, that you were in the case of those persons that you judge to be of the most holy and heavenly hearts and conversations? Do you not think they are in a far safer and better case than you ? Unless you are forsaken to blindness of mind, it is certainly so. And doth not this shew that you chuse and follow that which is worse, when your Consciences tell you it is worse? and refuse that which your Consciences tell you is best? But it is not such sluggish wishes
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:45238:41"/>
that will serve: To lye still and live idle, and wish your selves as rich as the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious, is not the way to make you so.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 14. At least, if you have no such wishes now, do you not think that you shall wish it at Death or Judgment? Do not your Consciences now tell you, that you shall shortly wish, O that I had hated sinful pleasure? O that I had spent my short life in obeying and trusting God? Will you not say with <hi>Balaam, Let me die the death of the Righteous, and let my last end be like his?</hi> O that I were in the case of those that mortified the Flesh, and lived to God, and laid not up their Treasure on Earth, but in Heaven? And why choose you not now that which you know you shall deeply wish that you had chosen?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 15. I take it for granted, that your merry, and sensual, and worldly Tempters and Companions, deride all this, and persuade you to despise it, as if it were but needless, melancholy, trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som talk: But tell me, do you think in Conscience that it is sound reason that they give you, and such as should satisfie a sober man, that careth what becomes of his soul for ever? If it be, I make a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to you. Bring any of them to me, or any such man, and in your hearing let the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:45238:42"/>
case be soberly debated: I will hear all that they can say against a holy, sober life, for the World, and for their fleshly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: And you shall hear what I can say on the contrary, and then do but use the reason of a man, and judge as you see cause. As <hi>Elias</hi> said to the <hi>Israelites, Why halt you between two Opinions: If the Lord be God, follow him; If</hi> Baal <hi>be God, follow him.</hi> If Money, Preferment, Drink, and Lust be best, take it: But if God, Heaven, Christ, Faith, Hope, and Holiness be best, at your peril refuse them not, and halt no longer. I suppose you sometime think of the case, (or else you are dead in sin.) I pray you tell me, or tell your selves, <hi>which cause seemeth best upon the deepest thoughts and consideration:</hi> But if you will take the laughter or scorns of ignorant Sots, instead of reason, and instead of sober consideration, you are well worthy of the damnation which you so wilfully choose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 16. But if you think highly of their Wit or Learning, who sin as you, and who encourage and deceive you, I pray you answer these two questions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Which side is Christ, and his Prophets, and Apostles on? Which side doth the Scripture speak for? Which way went all
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:45238:42"/>
the Saints whose names are now honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? Were they for the fleshly or the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life? Were they for the love of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures more than God? Doth Christ from Heaven teach you an earthly or a heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly choice and life? Did he come to cherish sin, or to destroy it, and save us from it? You can make no doubt of this, if ever you read or heard the Bible. And</p>
            <p n="2">2. Which do you think were the wiser and better men, and worthy to be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and followed? Whether Christ and all his Apostles, and Saints, that ever were in the world to this day, or the Drunkards, and Whoremongers, and Worldlings, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride the Doctrine sent from Heaven? If there be a Heaven, is Drunkenness or So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety liker to be the way to it? But if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed you will take the mocks of a swinish Sot to be wiser than God, than Christ, than Prophets, and Apostles, and all that ever went to Heaven, and their jears to be more credible than all God's Word, what can a man say to convince such Wretches with any hope?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 17. I further ask you, <hi>Have you not some secret purposes hereafter to repent?</hi> If not, alas, how far are you from it? and how forlorn is your case? But if you have, Conscience is a Witness against you, that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:45238:43"/>
you choose and live in that case and course which you know is worst: Were it not worst, you need not purpose to repent of it: And will you wilfully choose known evil, when the very nature of mans Will is to love good?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 18. And if you believe that the faithful are in a happier case than you, tell me, <hi>What hindereth yet but you may be like them,</hi> and yet be happy as well as they? Hath God put any exception against you in his word? Is not Mercy and Salvation proclaimed and offered to you as freely as to them? Did any thing make you so bad as you are, but your own choice and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? And can any thing yet hinder you from pardon and Salvation, if you your selves were but truly willing? What if your Parents were bad, and bred you up amiss? God hath told you, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. and 33. that if you will but do your own part yet, and take warning and avoid your Parents sin, and give up your selves unfeignedly to him, he will save you whatever your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were. What if Princes, or Lords, or learned men, should be your tempters by words or example? None of them can force you to one sin: God is greater and wiser than they, and more to be believed and obeyed; and your Salvation is not in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:45238:43"/>
any of their power. What if your old com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions tempt you? They can but tempt you; they cannot constrain you to any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. All the Devils in Hell, or men on earth cannot damn you, no nor make you sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, if you do it not your selves. Refuse not Christ, and he will not refuse you: And when he is willing, if you be but willing, truly willing to be saved from sin and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, and to have Christ, Grace, and Glory in the use of the means which God hath appointed you, neither Earth nor Hell can hinder your Salvation: Who but your selves keep you from forsaking the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, House, or Baits which have deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you? Who but your selves keep you from lamenting your sin, and flying to Christ, and begging Mercy, and giving your selves to God? If you think that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Christians are the happiest, refuse not to be such your selves. It will be your own doing, your own wilful obstinacy if you pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish: But of this I have already said more in my <hi>Call to the Vnconverted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 19. <hi>Dare you deliberately resolve or bargain to take your fleshly pleasures for your part, instead of all your hopes of Heaven?</hi> I hope none of you are yet so mad: I think it is but few, if any, of the Witches that make so express a bargain with the Devil:
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:45238:44"/>
If they did, O how they would tremble when they see their glass almost run out, and death at hand! If you dare not make such a bargain in plain words, O do not do the same in the choice of your hearts and the practice of your lives, and deceive your selves by thinking that you do it not, when you do. It is God and not you that maketh the conditions of Salvation and Damnation. If you choose that life which God hath told us is the condition of Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and finally refuse that life which God hath made the condition of Salvation, it will in effect be all one as to chuse Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and refuse Salvation. He that chooseth deadly poison, or refuseth his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary food, chooseth Death, and refuseth Life in effect. God hath said, <hi>If ye live af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Flesh ye shall die, but if by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit you mortifie the deeds of the Body, you shall live.</hi> Rom. 8. Christ tells you that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less you are born again and converted, you cannot enter into his Kingdom. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3 3, 5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.3. and that <hi>Without Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness none shall see God.</hi> Refuse these, and choose the world and sinful pleasures, and you refuse Salvation, and shall have no better than you choose. What you judge best choose resolvedly, and do not cheat your selves.</p>

               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:45238:44"/>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> 20. Have you no natural love to your Parents or your Country? O what inhumane cruelty is it, to break the hearts of those from whom you had your Being, and who were tender of you, when you could not help your selves? Doubtless one reason why God hath put so strong a love in Parents to their Children, and made your Birth and Breeding so costly to your Mothers, and made the Milk which is formed in her own Body to be the first nourishment of your lives, is to oblige you to answerable Love and Obedience: And if after all this you prove worse than Bruits, and become the grief of their Souls, that thus bred, and loved, and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished you, do you think God will not at last make this far sadder to you, than ever it was to them? If cruelty to an enemy, much more to a stranger, to a neighbour, to a friend, be so hateful to the God of Love, that it goeth not unrevenged, O what will unnatural cruelty to Parents bring upon you? Yea, even in this Life, as honouring Father and Mother hath a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial promise of prosperity and long life, so dishonouring and grieving Parents is usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly punished with some notable calamity, as a forerunner of the great revenge here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="tcp:45238:45"/>And you cannot but perceive that such as live in Sensuality, and Lust, and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, are the great troublers of Church, and State: God himself hath said it, <hi>There is no peace to the wicked,</hi> Isa. 48.52. and 57 21. <hi>For the wicked are like the troubled Sea when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.</hi> v. 22. Isa. 59.8. <hi>The way of peace they know not; there is no judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in their goings: They have made them crooked paths; whosoever goeth therein shall not know peace.</hi> They give no peace to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and God will deny peace to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: Yea, the nature of their own sin denieth it them, as broken Bones, and griping sickness deny ease to the Body. And can you think you shall become the shame of the Church, and the troublers of the Land, and that God will not trouble you for it? If you will be enemies of God and your Country, you will prove the sorest Enemies to your selves.</p>
            <p>And who is the gainer by all this? No one in the World; unless you will call it the Devil's gain, to have his malicious, cruel Will fulfilled: And sure the pleasing the Devil and a fleshly Lust, Fancy, or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, can never compensate all your losses, nor comfort you under the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:45238:45"/>
which you wilfully bring upon your selves.</p>
            <p>Young Men, the reason I thus deal with you by way of question is, that I may, if possible, engage your own thoughts in answering them: For I find most are apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to learn of themselves: And indeed without your selves, and your own seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thoughts, we cannot help you to true understanding. He that readeth the wisest Lecture to Boys or Men, that take no heed to what is said, yea, or that will not make it their own study to understand and remember, doth but cast away his labour. It's hard saving any man <hi>from himself</hi>; but there is no saving any man <hi>without himself,</hi> and his own consent and labour. If you will but now take these twenty questions in secret into your serious thoughts, and consider of them, till you can give them such an answer as reason should allow, and as you will stand to before God, when the mouth of all iniquity shall be stopt, I should not doubt but you will reap the benefit.</p>
            <p>O what should a man do that pittieth blind and wilful sinners, to make them willing of their own recovery? Here all stops: And must it stop at this? Are you not willing? And will you not so much as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:45238:46"/>
of the reasons that should make you willing, when Heaven or Hell must be the consequence? O what a thing is a blind mind, and a dead and hardened heart? What a befooling thing is fleshly Lust? O what need had mankind of a Saviour? And what need have all of a Sanctifier, and of his holy word, and of all the holy means of Grace?</p>
            <p>Poor sinners! O let not your Teachers, and your Parents Counsel and Tears be brought in as witnesses against you to your condemnation! O add not this to all their griefs, that their Counsel and their Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows must sink you deeper into Hell! Alas, it were sadness enough to them to see that it is all in vain! Let not this Counsel of mine to you be rejected to the increase of your guilt and misery: If it do you no good, it will leave you worse. Were I present with you, I should not think it too much, would that prevail, to kneel to you, to beg, that you would but well consider your own case and ways, and think before of what will follow: And that you will study a wise and satisfactory answer to the questions put to you, till you are resolved. Your case is not desperate: Mercy is yet offered you: The day of Grace is not yet past; God is not unwilling to receive you;
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:45238:46"/>
Christ is not unwilling to be your Saviour if you consent: No difficulty in the world maketh us afraid of your damnation, but your own foolish choice and wicked Wills. Our care is not to make God merciful, nor to make Christs merits and sacrifice suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, nor to get God to promise you pardon if you repent and come to him by Christ: All this is done already; but that which is undone is to make you conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and truly willing, and to live as those that indeed are willing to let go the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonous pleasures of sin, and to take God and Heaven for your hope and port on, and to be saved and ruled by Christ, and sanctified by his Spirit, and to receive his daily help and mercies to this end, in the use of his appointed means, and without this you are undone for ever. And is there any hurt in all this? If there were, is it worse than the filth of sin, and the Plagues that follow here and for ever! Worthy is he to bear at last, <hi>Depart from me thou worker of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> and to be thrust away from the hopes of Heaven, that after all that can be said and done, chuseth sin as more desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than this God, this Saviour, this Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier, and this Glory.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VIII. General Directions to the willing.</head>
            <p>THough the blindness and obstinacy of fleshly Sinners too oft frustrate great endeavours, yet we may well hope, that the Prayers and tears of Parents, and the calls of God, may prevail with many; and I may hope, that some that have read what is before written, will say, <hi>We are willing to hear and learn that we may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: tell us what it is that we must do.</hi> And on that hope, I shall give such miscarrying Youth some <hi>General Advice,</hi> and some Counsel about their <hi>particular cases,</hi> and all as briefly as I may. O that the Lord would make you that read this, truly wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to practise these ten Directions follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! How happy yet may you be!</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Set your Vnderstandings seriously, and diligently to the work which they are made for, and consider well what is your Interest and your Duty, till you come to a fixed Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, what is for your good, and what is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:45238:47"/>
for your hurt, and what that good or hurt will be.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Should it be a hard thing to persuade a man in his wits to <hi>love himself,</hi> and to think what is good or hurtful to himself, especially for everlasting? Why are you Men if you will live like Dogs? What do you with Understandings if you will not use them? What will you use them for, if not for your own good, and to avoid mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry? What good will you desire, if not everlasting Joy and Glory? and what hurt will you avoid, if not Hell fire? Have you reason, and can you live as if these were not worth the thinking on? Will you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow your thoughts all the day and year upon you know not what, nor why, and not one hour soberly think of such impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant things as these? O Sirs! Will you go out of the World before you well think whither you must go? Will you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Judge of Souls, to give up your great account before you think of it, and how it must be done? Is he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the help of <hi>Grace,</hi> that will not use his natural <hi>Reason</hi>? I beg it of you as ever you care what becomes of you for ever, that you will some time alone set your selves for one hour seriously to think, [Who made you, and why; what you owe him;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:45238:48"/>
how much you depend on him; what you have done against him; how you have spent your time; what case your Souls are in; what Christ hath done for you; and what he is or would be to you; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are sanctified and forgiven; what Gods Spirit must do for you; and what you must be and do if you will be saved; and if it be otherwise, whither it is that you must go.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Therefore I next advise you and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you, that you live not as at a great distance from Eternity, nor foolishly flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your selves with the deceitful promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of long Life: And were it sure to be an hundred years, remember how quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and certainly they will end. O Time is nothing! Therefore think of nothing in this World as separated from the World to come. Whatever you are doing, or saying, or thinking, the Boat is hasting to the Gulf: You are posting to Death and Judgment: Which way ever you go, by wealth or poverty, health or sickness, busie or idle, single or married, you are going still to the Grave and to Eternity. Judge then of every thing as it tendeth to that end: And think of nothing as not related as a means, to the near and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:45238:48"/>
end: O choose and do that which Reason and Conscience telleth you, that you will at last earnestly wish that you had chosen and done; when you are tempted to be prayerless and averse to good, or to run to Lust or sinful Pleasure, ask your selves seriously; how will this look in the final review? What shall I think of this at last? Will it be my comfort, or my tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? O judge as you will judge at last.</p>
            <p n="3">III. My third Counsel is, If your Consciences tell you that you have fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly sinned against God and your Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, make not light of it; but presently, and openly, go to your Parents or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and penitently confess your sinful Life in general, and your known or open sins particularly: But such secret sins which wronged not them, and will blast your Reputation, you are not bound to confess openly, unless the <hi>Ease</hi> or <hi>future Direction</hi> of your doubtful and troubled Consciences require it: But when your vicious fleshly life is known, excuse it not, hide not the evil by Lies or extenuation, when you have wronged your Parents or Masters by disobedience, and by robbing them of part of your Time and Service,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:45238:49"/>
if not also of their Money or goods, go to them with sorrow and shame, and confess how foolishly you have served the Flesh, to the injury of them, to the offending of God, and to the unspeakable hurt of your own Souls: Lament your sin, and ask them forgiveness, and intreat their Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and their careful Government of you for the time to come, and sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promise them Reformation and Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Yea, If you have had familiar Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions in your sin, go to them, and tell them,
<q>[God and Reason have convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me of my sinful folly, that for bruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish, fleshly Pleasure, have wilfully bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the Laws of my Creator and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and for nothing undone and lost my Soul, if Christ do not recover me by found Repentance. O how mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have we despised our Salvation? How easily might we have known, had we but searcht and considered the word of God, that we were displeasing God, undoing our selves, and making work for future sorrows? Should I, when I know this, and when I know that I am going to Death and Judgment, yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinately go on, and be a hardened Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel against Christ and Grace, what can I
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:45238:49"/>
expect, but to be forsaken of God and lost for ever? O therefore as we have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, let us repent together! You have been a snare to me, and I to you: We have been agents of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to draw each other to sin and misery: Certainly all this must sooner or later be repented of. O let us joyn together in Sorrow, and Reformation, and a holy, obedient Life. If you will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, I here declare to you before God, (for I know that he seeth and heareth me) that I will be your Companion in sin no more: I beg pardon for tempting you: I resolve by Gods Grace to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer my Salvation and my Obedience to God, before a base and beastly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: Whatever you say against it, I will never more forsake my Salvation to follow you, nor ever take you to be wiser than God, nor better friends to me than my Saviour, nor your Words more regardable than Gods word, nor a Whore, or a merry Cup, or Vanity, to be better than Heaven, nor Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Holiness to be worse than Hell. If you will not be undeceived with me, I will pray for you; but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce your sinful Company, and my warning will be a Witness against you to your confusion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:45238:50"/>Stick not at the scorn of fools, nor at the shame of such Repentance and Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: It may profit others: But however it is no more than in hope you owe them, whom you have wronged and endangered by sin: And it will lay some new obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on your selves, to amend by doing what you have so professed: And sure Conscience and shame will somewhat the more hinder you, from evermore joyning with them in the sin which you have so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed and renounced. And think not this too much, for there is no jeasting with God, and with everlasting joy or misery.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. My next Counsel is, <hi>presently, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandingly,</hi> and <hi>considerately, renew the Covenant which you made in Baptism with God your Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Consider whether to be a Christian is not necessary to your Salvation; and then consider what it is to be a Christian, and whether it be not a far higher thing, than meerly to take that name upon you, and be of that party, and to joyn with the right Church, and to have the bare words and picture of believers: And then consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whether God will be mocked with Shews, and Ceremonies, and dead Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and false Professions; and whether
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:45238:50"/>
the lifeless Carkass or Image of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will be taken by God instead of the life and power of it; and will ever save a Soul. Yea, whether a false counterfeit Christian, bred up under Christian Instructions and Examples, do not make your guilt far greater, and your case more miserable than <hi>Americans</hi> or <hi>Indians,</hi> that never heard what you have heard: And when perhaps you have spoken against Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites your selves, whether there be any more notorious Hypocrites than such as you, who say you are Christians, and yet live to the Flesh in the odious sins which Christ abhorreth; Think what a dreadful thing it is to profess a Religion which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth you, and to say over that Creed which you believe not, and those Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Lords Prayer which you desire not, and those Commandments which you break and will condemn you: To rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst God while you say you believe in him: To despise Christs Government while you say you trust him for Salvation: To ask for his Grace when you would not have it, to sanctifie you, and save you from your sin: To beg Mercy of God, and to reject this Mercy, and to have no Mercy on your selves. O think what a doleful case it is to see distracted sinners such Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:45238:51"/>
playing with such Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, so near Gods Bar, and in his sight: And to make no better use of Prayers and the name of Christians, and the Professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Truth, than to give the Devil more matter to accuse you, and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to torment you, and a righteous God to say to you at last, <hi>Out of thy own mouth will I judge thee, thou wicked Rebel.</hi> Didst thou not confess, that Jesus was the Christ, and that thou didst believe the Gospel and the Life to come; and yet didst live in the wilful disobeying of Christ and the Gospel, and base contempt of God and thy Salvation?</p>
            <p>And when you have considered the sad case of Hypocrites, that call themselves Christians to their own Condemnation, when they are none such, then think seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously what the Covenant was, which was made for you in your Baptism, and you have taken on you to own. Think what it is devotedly to trust to God as your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled Father, and devotedly to trust to Christ as your Saviour, your great Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Governour, and Mediator with the Father; what it is devotedly to trust the Holy Spirit to illuminate, sanctifie and quicken you in a holy Life, and to stren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and comfort you against, and under,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:45238:51"/>
all your Trials. Consider what it is to take the <hi>Flesh,</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Devil,</hi> as they are against this holy Life and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Hope, for your Enemies, and to list your selves under Christ in a vowed War to the death against them. Think how you have perfidiously broken this Covenant, on which all the Hope of your Salvation lieth. And then if you dare not utterly renounce all that Hope, presently and resolvedly renew this Covenant. Lament your violation of it to God: Do it not only in a passion, but upon serious consideration make that choice and resolution, which you dare stand to at a dying hour, and on which you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that God for Christs sake will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you, and forgive you. O think what a Mercy it is to have a Saviour, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all your heinous sins, will bring you reconciled as Sons to God, for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of his Sacrifice and Righteousness, and by his powerful Intercession, and will send from Heaven the Spirit of God into your hearts, to renew those blind, dead, carnal minds to God's holy Image, and will dwell in you, and carry on your Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the end. Thankfully and joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accept this Covenant and Grace, and again give up your selves to God, your Father, Saviour and Sanctifier; but be sure
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:45238:52"/>
that you do it <hi>absolutely,</hi> without deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful exceptions and reserves; and that you do it resolvedly, and not only in a frighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mood; and yet that you do it as in the strength of the Grace of Christ, not trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the stedfastness of your own deceitful, mutable Hearts. And when you can truly say, that you unfeignedly consent, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new this Covenant in your hearts, then go the next opportunity to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and there penitently and faithfully renew it openly in the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn way that Christ hath appointed you; thankfully profess your Trust in Christ, and receive a sealed Pardon of your sins, and Title to everlasting Life; and settle your Conversation in the Communion of Saints, as you hope to live with such for ever.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Hence forward set your selves as the true Schollars of Christ, to learn his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and as his true Subjects to know his Laws, and as those that trust their Souls into his Hand, to understand, and firmly believe his Promises for this Life, and that which is to come: And as the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed man, <hi>Psal.</hi> 1, 2, 3. <hi>To delight in the Law of the Lord, and meditate in it day and night.</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:45238:52"/>
As you were wont to steal some hours from God and your Masters, to go to the house of Sin and Death, so now get such hours as lawfully you can, from your other Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and diversions; but especially on the Lords-days; and get alone, and beg mercy and Grace from God, and set your selves to read the Bible, and with it read some Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisms, and some sound and serious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises of Divinity which are most suitable to your state.</p>
            <p>It is young men that have miscarried, and being convinced are willing to turn to God, that I am now directing. And therefore supposing that you will ask me what Books I would commend to you, I will answer you accordingly (supposing still that you prefer the Bible.)</p>
            <p n="1">1. For the full resolving of your Hearts to a sound Repentance, and a holy life, read <hi>Ioseph Allenes</hi> Book of Conversion, <hi>Richard Allens</hi> Vindication of Godliness, and their Book of <hi>Covenanting</hi> with God, and his Victory over the World, Mr.<hi>Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys</hi> New birth, and some of the old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of Repentance, such, as Mr. <hi>Stocks,</hi> Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dikes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Marburys, Bunny's</hi> correction of <hi>Parsons</hi> Book for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, <hi>Iohn Rogers</hi> Doctrine of Faith, <hi>William Fenners</hi> Books, <hi>Sam. Smith</hi> on the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:45238:53"/>
first, and the fifty first <hi>Psalms,</hi> and his great Assize, and on the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> Conversion, <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields</hi> Marrow, Mr. <hi>Hows</hi> blessedness of the Righteous, and of Delighting in God.</p>
            <p>And if you would have any of mine, read the <hi>Call to the Vnconverted,</hi> or the Treatise of <hi>Conversion,</hi> and the <hi>Directions for sound Conversion,</hi> and <hi>Now</hi> or <hi>Never,</hi> and a <hi>Saint or a Bruit,</hi> or which of all these Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence shall afford you.</p>
            <p n="2">II. If you would have help to try your hearts, lest they be deceived, read <hi>Alleins</hi> foresaid Book of the Covenant, and <hi>Pinkes</hi> Tryal of sincere Love to Christ, many Books of marks are extant, <hi>Bifields, Rogers, Hars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, Berries,</hi> &amp;c. And Mr. <hi>Chishull</hi> and Mr. <hi>Mead</hi> of being <hi>almost Christians.</hi> If you would have any of mine, read the <hi>Right method for peace of Conscience,</hi> and <hi>Directions for weak Christians,</hi> where are the Characters of the <hi>false,</hi> the <hi>weak,</hi> and the <hi>strong.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. For the dayly Government of Heart and Life, read the Practice of Piety, <hi>Scud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> daily walk, Mr. <hi>Reyners</hi> directions, (three excellent Books) Mr. <hi>Corbets</hi> small private thoughts. And if you would have any of mine, read my <hi>Family Book,</hi> and the <hi>Divine Life,</hi> the <hi>Life of Faith,</hi> or the <hi>Saints Rest,</hi> and for those that can read great ones, my <hi>Christian Directory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:45238:53"/>IV. And it will not be unuseful to read some profitable History, especially the Lives of exemplary persons, and the Funeral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons which characterize them. I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced to two, which are eminently worth your reading, and most true, both young men, that is, <hi>Iohn Ianeway's</hi> Life, and <hi>Ioseph Alleins,</hi> and given you the true ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Characters in their Funeral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of Mr. <hi>Ashurst,</hi> (an excellent pattern for Apprentices and Tradesmen,) Mr. <hi>Stubs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Corbet,</hi> and of Mr. <hi>Wadsworth,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Baker.</hi> Read Mr. <hi>Samuel Clarks</hi> Lives, and his <hi>Martyrology,</hi> and his <hi>Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi> Dr. <hi>Beards</hi> examples, or <hi>Fox's</hi> Book of Martyrs. Some Church History, and History of the Reformation, and the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our own Country, will be useful.</p>
            <p n="5">V. As you grow up to more judgment you may read methodical Sums of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, especially <hi>Ames</hi> his Marrow, and his Cases of Conscience, (which are in English transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) and Commentaries.</p>
            <p>Great store of all sorts of good Books through the great mercy of God are common among us: He that cannot buy, may borrow.</p>
            <p>But take heed that you lose not your time in reading Romances, Play Books, vain Jests, or seducing or reviling Disputes, or needless Controversies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:45238:54"/>This course of Reading Scripture and good Books will be many ways to your great advantage.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It will above all other ways increase your knowledge.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It will help your Resolutions and holy affections and direct your lives.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It will make your lives pleasant; the knowledge, the usefulness, the variety will be a continual recreation to you, unless you are utterly besotted or debaucht.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The pleasure of this will turn you from your filthy fleshly pleasure. You will have no need to go for delight to a Play-house, a Drinking-house or to Beastly lusts.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It will keep you from the sinful loss of time, by idleness or unprofitable employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or pastimes. You will cast away Cards and Dice when you find the sweetness of useful Learning.</p>
            <p>But be sure that you choose the most use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and necessary subjects, and that you seek knowledge for the love of Holiness and Obedience.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. The sixth part of my advise is, <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake ill Company and converse with such as will be helps to your Knowledge, Holiness, and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and not such as will draw you to sin and misery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:45238:54"/>You have found by sad experience what power ill Company hath on fools, with such a merry Tale, a Laughter, a Jest, a Scorn: a merry Cup, and a bad Example and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, doth more than Reason, or Gods Authority, or the Love of their Souls. A Physician may go among the Sick and Mad to Cure them; and a Wiseman that seeth these will pitty them, and hate sin the more. But what do you do there, where you have already catcht the infection of their disease. The mind of a man is known much by the Company which he chooseth, and if you choose ill, no wonder if you speed ill, <hi>Pro.</hi> 13.20. <hi>He that walketh with wise men shall be wise; but a companion of fools shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed. Prov.</hi> 28.7. <hi>Whoso keepeth the Law is a wise Son, but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his Father. Psal.</hi> 119.63. <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.</hi> 26.4, 5. <hi>I have not sate with vain persons. neither will I go in with dissemblers, I have hated the Congregation of evil doers, and will not sit with the wicked.</hi> 119.115. <hi>Depart from me ye evil doers, for I will keep the Commandments of my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">VII. Especially be sure that you <hi>run not willfully upon Temptation, but keep as far from every tempting bait, and object as you can,</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:45238:55"/>
Fire and Gunpowder, or Straw must be kept at a sufficient distance, no man is long safe at the very brink of danger, especially if it be his own choice, and more especially if it be a sin that his nature is much inclined to. No wise man will trust corrupted nature very far, especially where he hath often faln already. The best man that is should live in fear, when an enticing bait of sin is near him. If <hi>David</hi> that prayed, <hi>turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity,</hi> had better practiced it, O! what heynous sin had he escaped; Had he made a Covenant with his eyes, as <hi>Iob</hi> did, what wounds had he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented? The Feast that you see not, the Cup that is a mile off, the person that is far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant, the words which you hear not, are not they that you are most in danger of? But when tempting meat and drink are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, and the tempting person hath se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret familiarity with you, and tempting or provoking words are at your ears, then alas many have need of more Grace, Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Mortification than they have.</p>
            <p>If you knew well what sin is, and what is the consequence, you would be more watchful and resolved against temptations than against Thieves or Fire, or the places infected by the Plague.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Make it the cheif Study of your
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:45238:55"/>
Lives to understand what mans everlasting hope is, and to get a lively well setled belief of it; and to bring your souls to take it joyfully for your true felicity and end, and thence daily to fetch the powerful motives of your duty and your patience, and your contenting comfort in Life and at your Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>end</hi> is the <hi>Life</hi> of all the means. If heavenly blessedness be not the chief <hi>end</hi> that you live, hope and labour for in the World, your whole lives will be but carnal, vain and the way to misery: for the <hi>means</hi> can be no better than the <hi>End.</hi> God that is the beginning is our <hi>End</hi>; We are made and governed by Him and for Him. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Glory is the sight of his Glory, and the Everlasting perfection and pleasure of joyful mutual Love.</p>
            <p>But we are not the noblest Creatures next to God in excellency and desert, yea we are sinners who have deserved to be cast out from his Love. And therefore as in the way we must <hi>come to him</hi> by a Saviour, so at the blessed end we must <hi>enjoy him</hi> by a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, and to see Gods Glory in Christ and the Heavenly <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the blessed society of Saints and Angels, continually flaming in Love, Joy and Praises to the most holy God. This, this is the felicity for which we labour, suffer and hope.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:45238:56"/>2. And O! how great, and how need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a work it is, to search, study and pray for so firm a belief of this unseen Glory, as may so resolve, engage, and comfort us in some good measure, as if we had seen it with these eyes? O! what men would one hours being in heaven make us, or one clear sight of it? Faith hath a greater work to do than a dreaming or dead opinion can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. If it be not well grounded first, and well exercised upon Gods Love, Promise and Glory from day to day, you will find cause (sadly) to lament the weakness of it. For this use you have great need of the help of such Books, as open clearly the evident proofs of the Christian verity, which I have breifly done in the beginning of the 2d. part of my <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and more largely in 2 other Books, viz. <hi>The unreasonableness of Infidelity, and the reasons of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> A firm b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lief of the World to come, is it that must <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ake us serious Christians, and over come the snares of worldly vanity.</p>
            <p>And your Faith being well setled, set your selves dayly to <hi>use it, and live by it,</hi> dwell in the joyful hopes of the heavenly Glory. what is a man that liveth not in the use of <hi>Reason?</hi> And you must know that you have as daily use for your <hi>Faith,</hi> as for your <hi>Reason.</hi> Without reason you can neither
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:45238:56"/>
safely eat or drink, nor converse with men as a man, but as a Bedlam, not do any business that concerneth you; and therefore you must Live by your <hi>Reason.</hi> And without <hi>Faith</hi> you cannot <hi>please God,</hi> nor <hi>obtain Salvation,</hi> no nor use your <hi>Reason</hi> for any thing higher than to serve your appetites and purvey for the flesh, and therefore you must <hi>Live by Faith,</hi> or live like Beasts, and worse than Beasts, and cannot otherwise live to God, nor live in the hopes of blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness hereafter. O! Consider that the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between living chiefly upon and for an Earthly fleshly felicity, or a heavenly; is the great difference between the holy and the unholy, and the fore-goer of the difference between those in Heaven and those in Hell.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Still remember that the <hi>great Means,</hi> of all the good that here or hereafter you can expect, is the <hi>great Mediator, the great Teacher, Ruler and Intercessor</hi> for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And therefore out of him you can do nothing. All duty that you offer to God must be by his Mediation, and so must all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy which you receive from God. To come to God by him, who is the Way, the Truth, and the Life, must be your daily work of Faith. His blood must wash you from all sin past, and from the guilt of daily failings,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:45238:57"/>
and infirmities. None but he can effectually teach you to know God and your selves, your duty and your everlasting hopes. None but he can render your persons, praises and actions acceptable to God, because you are sinners, and unmeet for Gods acceptance without a Mediator. All power in heaven and Earth is given him, and your Lives and Souls are at his will; and it is he that must judge you, and with whom you hope to live in Glory. Therefore you must so live by the Faith of the Son of God, who hath loved you and and given himself for you, that you may say it is he that liveth in you, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.2021. This is the Fountain from whence you must daily fetch your strength and comfort.</p>
            <p n="10">X. And still remember that it is by the <hi>operation</hi> of the holy Spirit, that the Father and the Son do sanctifie Souls, and Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and breed them up for Glory. It is by the Holy Ghost, that God dwelleth in us by Love, and Christ by Faith. Therefore see that you rest not in corrupted nature, and trust not to your selves, or to the Flesh. Your souls are dead to God and Holiness, and your duties dead, till the Spirit of Christ do quicken them. You are <hi>blind</hi> to God and mad in sin, till the spirit illuminate you, and give you understanding. You are like Enemies out of Love with God, Heaven and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:45238:57"/>
Holiness, till this Spirit reconcile you and sanctifie your wills. You will have no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like spiritual holy pleasure, till the Holy Spirit renew your hearts, and make them fit to delight in God. O that men knew the great necessity of the illuminating, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, sanctifying, comforting influence of the Spirit of God, how far would they be from deriding it, as some prophane ones do. By this Holy Spirit the sacred Records were written, and by miracles of Christ and his Apostles, and Evangelists and Prophets, seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and delivered to the Churches. And by this Spirit the orders and Government of the Church were setled. And by him we are inlightned to understand the Scripture, and inclined to Love them and delightfully believe them and obey them. Study there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obediently these Writings of the Holy Ghost, and confidently trust them. O! be not found among the resisters, or neglecters of the Spirits help and motions, when proud self-confidence or fleshly lusts do rise against them.</p>
            <p>Christs bodily presence is taken from the Earth, he promised instead of it (which was but in one place at once) to send his Spirit which is to the soul more than the Sun light to the Eye, and can shine in all the world at once. This is his Agent on Earth, by whom
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:45238:58"/>
(in Teachers and Learners) he carrieth on his saving work. This is his Advocate who pleadeth his cause effectually against unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leif and fleshly lusts, and worldly wisdom. This is the well of living water, springing up in us to Everlasting life; the name, the mark of God on Souls, the Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generator, the author of Gods Holy Image, and the Divine Nature, even Divine life, and light and love, the Conqueror of the World and Flesh, the strengthner of the weak, the confirmer of the wavering, the comforter of the sad, and the pledge, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and first fruits of everlasting life. O therefore pray earnestly for the Spirit of Grace, and carefully obey him, and joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully praise God, in the sence of his holy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and help.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IX. Additional Counsel to Youngmen, who are bred up to Learning, and Publick work, especially to the Sacred Ministry in the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities and Schools.</head>
            <p n="1">§. 1 IT was the case of the <hi>London</hi> Appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, who are nearest me, and I have
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:45238:58"/>
oft to do with, which first provoked me to this work, and therefore which was chief in my intention. But had I as near oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to be a Counsellor to others, There are three sorts whom I should have prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for the sake of the Church and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to which they are of greater signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Those in the Schools and Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who are bred up for the Sacred Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Those there, and in the Inns of Court that are bred up to the knowledge of the Law.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Sons of Noblemen, Knights and others, that are bred up for some places of Government in the Kingdom, according to their several ranks. And of these it is the first that I shall most freely speak to.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. And first I shall mention the <hi>Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> of their case, and secondly the <hi>Danger</hi> that they are in of miscarrying, and what they should do to escape it.</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3.I. And indeed their condition as they prove good or bad, is of unspeakable importance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To the Church and the Souls of men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To the Peace of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To themselves. And,</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:45238:59"/>4. To their Parents, above the common case of others.</p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. 1. Of how great importance the <hi>Quality of the Clergy</hi> is to the Church and mens Salvation, many thousands have found to their Joy and Happiness, and I fear many more thousands to their sorrow and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And then of what importance the Quality of Scholars and Young Candidates, is to the soundness of the Clergy, I need not many words to make men of reason and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience know.</p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. 2. God who hath instituted the sacred office, and by his Spirit qualifieth men for the work, doth usually work ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fitness of <hi>their work,</hi> and <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications.</hi> As he doth the works of Nature according to the fitness of Natural second causes, (giving more light by the Sun, than by a Star or Candle, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so he doth the works of Morality, according to the fitness of Moral Causes. Holiness is the true Morality, and usually wrought by holy means. And though it be so supernatural in several respects (as it is wrought by the <hi>supernatural revelation,</hi> or doctrine, or a <hi>supernatural Teacher Christ,</hi> by the operation of the holy Ghost, a supernatural Agent, commonly called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, and raising the soul to God a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural object; and to a better state than
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:45238:59"/>
that of corrupted nature) yet we are <hi>natural recipients,</hi> and <hi>agents,</hi> and it is our <hi>natural faculties</hi> which Grace reneweth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing renewed exercise the <hi>acts</hi> of holiness; and God worketh on us according to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by causes suited to our capacities and to the work. As he useth not to give men the knowledge of Languages, Philosophy or any Art, by the Teaching of the ignorant and unskilful, so much as by Learned skilful Teachers, we must say the same of our Teac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hers of sacred Truth: and though Grace be the gift of the holy Ghost, experience constraineth all sorts of Christians almost to acknowledge what I here assert. Why else do they so earnestly contend, that they may live under the Teachers which they count the best? Will Hereticks teach men the Truth as well as the Orthodox; why then is there such a stir made against <hi>Hereticks</hi> in the World? and why are the Clergy so ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to silence such as Preach down that, which they approve. Will Papists choose Protestant Teachers, or Protestants choose Papists.</p>
            <p>And as men are unfit to teach others, that which they know not themselves, so unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving men, and unholy men, are far less fit to perswade the hearers to Faith and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, than believing holy Teachers are.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:45238:60"/>
Though some of them may be furnished with the same notions and words which seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Godly Teachers use, yet usually, even in that, they are greatly wanting: because they have not so throughly studied saving Truth, nor percieved its evidence, nor set their hearts upon it, nor deeply recieved and retained it. For serious affection quickneth the mind to serious consideration, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth men speedily and deeply to recieve that truth, which others recieve but slowly, superficially, or not at all. How eagerly and prosperously do men study that which they strongly love? And how hardly do they learn that, which they have no delight in? much more which they hate, and their very natures are against?</p>
            <p>But if an Hypocrite should have good no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and words, yet he will usually be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wanting in that serious delivery, which is ordinarily needfull to make the Hearers serious Christians. It seldom reacheth the heart of the Hearer, which cometh not from the heart of the Speaker. As light causeth light, so heat causeth heat; And the dead are unfit to generate Life. The arrow will not go far or deep, if both the Bow and Arm be not strong that shoot it; constant experience telleth us undeniably, of the different successe of the reading or saying of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:45238:60"/>
a Pulpit-lesson, or a dull, or a mere affected Speech, &amp; of the judicious, serious Explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; application of well chosen matter; which the experienced Speaker well understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and which he uttereth from the feeling of his Soul. And the Love of a Benefice, no, nor of applause neither, will not make a man preach in that manner, as the love of God, and the lively belief of heaven and hell, and as the desire of saving Souls will do. The means will be chosen and used, and the work done, agreeably to the principle and the end.</p>
            <p>But if a Stage-Hypocrite should learn the knack, or art of preaching, with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected fervency, and seeming zeal, yet, <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Paint</hi> will not reach the power and beauty of Nature: Usually affectation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayeth it self; and when it is discerned, the Hypocrisie is loathed: And it faileth or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily, in point of Constancie: <hi>Will the Hypocrite pray alwaies. Iob</hi> 27.10. Art will not hold out like Nature: (when the motives of Gain (which is their Godliness) ceaseth, the pleasure of applause, the means will cease. Yea, usually it turneth to a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant reviling of the serious piety which they counterfeited before, or of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, whose applause they did affect: For where the Hypocrisie of the Preacher is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, by his contrary self-condemning words, or life; and the people according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:45238:61"/>
judg of him as he is, his proud heart can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear it, but he turneth a malicious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacher of those, whose applause he sought, thinking by disgraceing them, to defend his own esteem, by making their censure of him incredible, or contemptible.</p>
            <p>And if the Hypocrite should hold on his Stage affectation, with plausible art, yet it will not reach to an answerable discharge of the rest of his ministerial work: It is from men, that he expecteth his reward, and in the sight of men, on the publick Stage that he appeareth in his borrowed Glory. But in his Family, or his Conversation, or his ministerial Duty to men in private, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth not his publick shew. He will not set himself to instruct, and win the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and impenitent, and zealously to save men from their sins, and to raise mens earthly minds to Heaven, by praying with them, and by heavenly discourse, and by a heavenly Conversation: nor will he be at much cost, or labour to do good.</p>
            <p n="6">§. 6. But alas, the far greatest part of bad unexperienced Clergie men, do prove so hurtful to the Church, that they have not so much as the Hypocrites seeming Zeal and Holyness to cloak their sin, or profit their people with. The sad case of the Christian World proclaimeth this; not
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:45238:61"/>
only in the Southern and Eastern Churches (<hi>Abassia, Egypt, Syria, Armenia,</hi> the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Moscovites, &amp;c.</hi> nor only the Papists Priests in the West, but too great a number in the Reformed Churches. And it is more lamentable than wonderful: For there goeth so much to the general planting of a worthy faithful Ministry, that it is the great Mercy of God, that such are not more rare.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If they have not Natural Capacity, there is not matter for Art and Ordinary Grace to elevate.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And if this Capacity be not improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by diligent and long study (which most will not undergo) it is no wonder if it be useless, or much worse.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And if it be not directed by a sound and skilful Teacher, but fall into the hands of an erroneous, or bad Guide; you may conjecture what the Fruits will be.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And if that good parts and studies be not kept from the mischievous enmity of a Worldly Mind, and Fleshly Lusts, how easily are they corrupted, and turned against their use and end, to the great hurt of the Church, and of themselves.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And if those that choose Prelates, or Church-Governours should be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of corrupted Judgments, wicked
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:45238:62"/>
Hearts, or vicious Lives, how probable is it, that they will choose such as themselves, or at least, such as will not much cross their Lusts.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And if such worldly and wicked Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates be the Ordainers, Examiners, Judges, and Institutors of the Inferior Clergie, or be their Rulers, it's easie to know what sort of men they will Introduce and Countenance, and what sort they will silence, and discourage.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And if <hi>Lay-Patrons</hi> have the choice of Parish Pastors, and most, or many of them should be such, as Christ tells us the <hi>Rich</hi> most usually are, a worldly, and sensual sort of men, or such as have no lively sense of Heavenly things, we may easily conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, what men such are likely to present.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And if the people have any where, (as anciently) the Choice when most of them are bad, what men will they choose. Or if they have not the choice, yet they are so considerable, that their Consent, or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, Love, or Hatred, will sway much with those that much live among them. But I must afterward say more of these Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p n="7">§. 7. And as all these Impediments are like to make worthy Pastors to be rare, so its certain that their naughtiness of such is like to make them exceeding hurtful, which is easily gathered from
<list>
                  <pb n="117" facs="tcp:45238:62"/>
                  <item>1. What they <hi>will be.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. What they will do.</item>
                  <item>3. In what manner they will do it. In all which, the effects may be probably fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen. And,</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It is supposed that they will be world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly minded men, that will take <hi>Gain</hi> for <hi>Godliness,</hi> and will judge that to be the best cause, and those the best persons, who most befriend their worldly Interest. They will love the Fleece more than the safety of the Flock, and their Benefices, more than the benefit of the people's Souls; they will serve their Bellies more than Christ, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. and being Lovers of the world, they will be real enemies to God. The Love of Money, in them, will be the root of all Evil. As <hi>Achan,</hi> and <hi>Gehezi,</hi> they will think they have reason for what they do; and if tempted, will with <hi>Iudas</hi> betray their Master.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And their fleshly desires will have lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle restraints, but what one sin doth put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another, or Gods controuling Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence give them. Their Reputation may make them avoid that which would be their disgrace: But secretly, they will serve their Appetites, and Fleshly Lusts. For they will not have Gods effectual Grace, nor much tenderness of Conscience to restrain them.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:45238:63"/>3. And <hi>Pride will</hi> be their very Nature. Esteem and applause will be taken for their due, and seem as necessary to them, almost as the Air, and as VVater to a Fish. Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be their Complexion; and will actuate their thoughts: And all these Vices will so corrupt their judgments, that there will want little more, than worldly Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest and temptations, to turn them to any Heresie, or ill Design.</p>
            <p>And it is much to be feared, that their prophanation of Holy things will make them worse, and more impenitent than other men. Partly, by the Righteous Judgment of God forsaking them; and partly, by the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of their own hearts, by long abuse of that truth which should have sanctified them: For when they have imprisoned it in unrighteousness, and long plaid, as Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, with that, which they preached and professed to believe, custom will so harden them, that their knowledge will have little power on their Hearts.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2ly. And no wonder if the Fruit be like the Tree These Vices will not be idle, nor bring forth Holy, or Just Effects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It's likely they will make it the chief care of their minds, to get that, which they most love. And that they will study pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment (which is the Clergie-mans near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est way to wealth.)</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="119" facs="tcp:45238:63"/>2. And then they must be Flatterers of those that can preferr them. Or at least, must not seriously call them to repentance, or tell them of their sin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In all differences, of what Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence soever, they will usually pass their judgment on the side of such as can preferr, or hurt them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In Religious controversies they will usually be on the side, that is for their wordly Interest, be it right, or wrong.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They will harden great men in their sins, by flattering them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They will harden the prophane, by pleasing them in their ignorance and ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to get them on their side.</p>
            <p n="7">7. They will be Enemies to the serious Religious people, because they discern the Vice and Hypocrisie, which they would conceal, and because they honour such as fear the Lord, while vile Persons are contemned in their Eyes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 15.4.</p>
            <p n="8">8. They will turn their preaching against such, partly to vent their malignant Spleen, and partly to overcome them as their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Hereupon they will describe their serious piety, as Faction, Self Opinion, and Hypocrisie, and will raise jealousies against them in the minds of Rulers, and increase the Rabbles malignity and rage,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:45238:64"/>
and will extenuate the sin and danger of the most ungodly sort, that take their own part.</p>
            <p n="9">9. They will shame their Office and Profession, by base mutability, turning with the Time and Tide, as Temptations from their worldly Interest lead them.</p>
            <p n="10">10. They will by their making light of Godliness, and by the scandal, or unholy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their own Conversations, make the vulgar believe that Godliness is either a cheat, or a matter of meer words, and outward observances, and to be of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of their Rulers, and a thing to keep men in some awe and order in a worldly Life.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Their ignorance oft makes them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for hard Controversies, and yet their pride and malignity will make them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to talk of what they understand not, and to take thence an occasion to revile those whom they dislike, and speaking evil of what they never knew, they will make up their want of knowledge, with outward Titles, pretended Authority, confident Affirmation, censorious Reproach, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently oppressing by power the Gainsayers.</p>
            <p n="12">12. If any mans Conscience be awakned to call him to true Repentance, they will either tell him it is needless melancholy trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and give him an opiate of some flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:45238:64"/>
false comfort, or preach him asleep again, with unsuitable things, or a cold, dull, formal kind of managing holy things.</p>
            <p n="9">§. 9. And such are too often the plagues of the Church and State, as well as injurious to individual Souls.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Their Ignorance, or scandalous Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Covetousness, and other sins, do ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them so contemptible in the Eyes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that it tends to make the Church, and all Religion so. And when Nobles, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and People think basely of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry, Church, and Religion for their sakes, how sad is the case of such a people. The Gospel is half taken away from a Nation, when 'tis taken out of their esteem, and brought under their reproach and scorn: And a scorned Clergie will prepare for the scorning of Religion: And an ignorant, or worldly ambitious, fleshly, scandalous Clergie, will be a scorned Clergy with two many. <hi>Erasmus</hi> much disgraced the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Protestants, when he described some of them, as having a Bottle of Wine at their Girdle, and his Translation of the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament</hi> in their hands, ready to dispute for it with blows: And so do many that tell the world how many of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters are given to excess of Drink, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaceable reviling of Dissenters. And the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:45238:65"/>
same <hi>Erasmus</hi> much depreciated either Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, or Scotists, when speaking of the Scotist Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> who was Dr. <hi>Collets</hi> Adversary, he saith, <hi>I have known some such whom I would not call Knaves, but never one, whom I could call a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> Not only Drunkenness and bruitish sins, but <hi>factitiousness, envy, unpeaceableness, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiousness,</hi> and especially a <hi>proud and word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mind,</hi> will be in most mens Eeyes, more ugly in a Minister, than others: For where there is a double Dedication to God, that which is <hi>Common,</hi> will seem <hi>Vnclean,</hi> and when there should be a double Holyness, sin will appear to be double sin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And indeed a carnal wordly Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie are oft the most powerful and obstinate hinderers of the Peace, and quietness of Church and State.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By fitting themselves to the humours of those, in whose power their preferments are, be it never so much to the injury of mens Souls, Bodies, or Estates, or against the publick good and safety! Or else, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people into errour for popular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By a domineering humour, in matters of Religion: taking themselves Law-giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to others, and taking their witts and wills for uncontroulable; laying Heaven
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:45238:65"/>
and Hell upon their own Inventions or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, and the Controversies which they end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly make, but understand not, and hereti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating, or anathematizing such as take them not for Oracles, or Rabbi's, that must not be gainsay'd.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And by Corrupting the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Church, by departing from the Christian simplicity, and purity; and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Doctrine, Worship, and Government, according to their own carnal worldly minds and interest.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And than militating against the best that contradict them, or stoop not to them, though it be to the distraction and division of the Churches. And usually they are the hardest to be brought to peace, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, and do most against it, when ever it is attempted by Peace-makers, who pitty the woeful case of such a self-disturbing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p n="10">§. 10. All this hath been so long mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested to the sad Experience of mankind, in most Nations, and Ages of the Christian World, that it is not to be denyed, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. And should we pretend the Honour of the Church and Clergie, for the denying, or the hiding of such grievous Sins, it would but make us partakers of the guilt, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please the most Holy God, who will have
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:45238:66"/>
sin in whomsoever shamed, and harden others who are ready to imitate them. The Holy Scriptures open and shame the sins even of <hi>Adam,</hi> of <hi>Noe,</hi> of <hi>Lot,</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> of <hi>Peter,</hi> and of Gods chosen people the <hi>Iews:</hi> and this was not a faulty uncovering of their naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but a necessary disgrace of sin, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of the Holyness and Justice of God, and a warning to others that <hi>we should not sin</hi> with such Examples before our Eyes. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>I have written the History of the Bishops, and Councils of former Ages, in which, with their virtues, I have opened their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages: some blame it, as if it were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering their nakedness. But I have said nothing but what is openly proclaimed of them long agoe, by their own greatest flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers; and it was Christ himself that said <hi>Remember</hi> Lot <hi>'s Wife</hi>: The Pit which so many have fallen into, must be uncovered, and God, and Holyness must be honoured, rather than those that dishonour them by sin: Sin confessed and forsaken, is not so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as sin denyed, and extenuated: He that hideth it, shall not prosper. Sin is a reproach to any people, <hi>Pro.</hi> 14.34. and 6.33. Even God that forgiveth it to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent, will shame it, to keep others from

            <p>Alas, what work have a worldly, proud, and ignorant Clergie made in most Christian Nations, these thirteen hundred years. <hi>Athanasius, Chrysostoms, Isidore-Pelusio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, &amp;c.</hi> but especially, excellent <hi>Gregory Nazianzene</hi> have told it us, even of their flourishing times, more plainly than I now intend to do: They have loved this present world: some set themselves by venting new and odd opinions, to draw Disciples after them for applause; some furiously heretica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them that differed from them by ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous words; and making themselves Lords of the Faith of others, and making their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Dictates the Oracles of the Church: striving who should be thought wisest and best, but especially who should be greatest, as if Christ had never judged in that Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie: Flattering Emperours and Princes, till they got Wealth and Power by them, and then over-topping them, and troubling the World by Rebellious, and Bloody Warrs. Tearing the Churches in pieces, on pretence of Union, and killing, and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men on pretence of Faith and Charity, and Cursing from Christ his faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, on pretence of using the Keyes of Christs Kingdom; setting up themselves,

and a worldly Kingdom, on pretence of the Spiritual Government of Christ; making Merchandize of Souls, on pretence of feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ruling them, cherishing the people in <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and sloth, and carnality, that they might be more obedient to their Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and lesse capable of opposing it; hating, and destroying the most consciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Christians, as <hi>Hereticks,</hi> or <hi>Schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> because they are the greatest Enemies to their Sin, and desires of Reformation; provoking Princes to become the bloody Persecutors of such, for the upholding of their worldly State and Dignity, yea, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them their Lictors or Executioners, to destroy such as they condemn.</p>
            <p>Such work as this, hath destroyed the <hi>Greeks,</hi> or <hi>Eastern</hi> Churches, set up <hi>Turkish</hi> Tyranny, by dividing Christians, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ruining the Emperors, making Religion a meer Image of lifeless formality, and Ceremony, and a powerless dying thing.

which it was in, in the days of <hi>Malachias,</hi> as <hi>Bernard</hi> described it, into the barbarous, briutish, ignorance and bloody inhumanity at which it is now arrived; and had the chief hand in the murder of two hundred thousand persons in the late Rebellious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection; such a Clergy had a chief hand in the civil wars in <hi>England</hi> in the reign of <hi>William Rufus, King Stephen, Hen.</hi> 3. <hi>King Iohn, &amp;c.</hi> the subject of <hi>Pryns</hi> History of the Treasons of Prelates: And alas such a corrupt sort of Ministers keepeth up the division of the <hi>German</hi> Protestants, under the name of <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calvinists,</hi> about Consubstantiation, Church-Images, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Predestination not understood. And had the Low-Countries ever had the stirs between Remonstrants and Contra-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants, or <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> ever had the miserable contentions, warres and cruelties between the former Episcopal par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the <hi>Laudians,</hi> or between them and the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> and all the silencings, and woefull contentions and Schisms that have thence followed, if the vices of the <hi>Clergy</hi> had not been the cause. And had we continued in this case these twenty years last, silencing, reviling and prosecuting about two thousand conscionable Preachers, and writing and preaching still for executing the Lawes against them, and

the prosecuted people flying from such a <hi>Clergy</hi> as ravening Wolves, And some censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the innocent with the guilty, could all this have been done by a wise, holy, and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Clergy,</hi> that served God in selfdenyal, and knew what it is to seek the good of Church and souls? When we yet continue under the same distractions and convulsions, and all cry out that a flood of misery is breaking in on the Land, and like to overwhelm us all, and still it is the <hi>Clergy</hi> that cannot or will not be reconciled, but animate Rulers and people against each other, and cannot or will not find the way of peace; yea all would be soon healed in probability, could the Nation but procure the <hi>Clergy</hi> to consent; certainly there is some grievous disease in our selves, which is like to pove mortal to such a Kingdom, and that while so many pray and strive for peace. Those men that have no more skill or will to heal the wounds, and stop the blood of a faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Church</hi> and State, nor wil by any reason or humble importunity be intreated to consent to the cheap and necessary cure, no nor to hold their hands from continued tearing of us, do tell all the world that they are sadly wanting in fitness for their sacred office, and that this unfitness is like to cost an endanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nation dear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:45238:69"/>Wo, wo, wo, to that Church, that hath Hypocrites, Ungodly, Unexperienced, Proud, Worldly, Fleshly, Unskilful, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful and Malignant Pastors, and that hath Wolves instead of Shepherds; wo to the Land that hath such. Wo to the Prince and States that have and follow such Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellors, and to the Souls that are subverted by them. Alas! from a bad Clergy hath sprung the greatest calamities of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, in all places to this very day.</p>
            <p n="11">§. 11. But will such mens sins prove less woful to themselves than others.</p>
            <p>No. 1. It is the sin and guilt it self, which is the greatest evil.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They aggravate their sin and guilt by a perfidious violating a double vow, their Baptismal Vow of Christianity, and their Ordination Vow to be Faithful Ministers of Christ.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They aggravate their guilt by their nearness to God in their Office, and Works, as <hi>Aarons</hi> two Sons that were struck dead, <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.2, 3. <hi>For God will be sanctifyed in them, that come nigh him, and before all the people he will be glorifyed.</hi> The examples of the <hi>Beth-shemites, Vzza, Vzziah,</hi> the bad Priests and False Prophets of old are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:45238:70"/>4. And it greatly addeth to the guilt to do all this or much of it as in the Name of God, or by his Commission. This is a dreadful taking of Gods Name in vain, for which he will not hold them guiltless. To pretend, that it is by Gods command, that they set up that which he abhorreth; that they corrupt his Doctrine, or Worship, or Church Order that they set up their own wills and sinful Laws instead of and against his Laws; that they tear his Church by proud Impositions, and wicked Anathema's, and Interdicts of whole Kingdoms, Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating and Deposing Kings, Absolving men from their Oaths of Allegiance, Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting and Murdering Godly men as He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, Silencing Faithful Ministers, Smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Shepherds and scattering the Flocks, and then reviling them as Schismaticks, and all this to uphold a worldly Kingdom of their own, and keep up their Pride, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and self-will, and to have Riches for provision for fleshly Lusts; I say to do all this as in the <hi>Name of Christ,</hi> with a <hi>sic dicit Dominus,</hi> and as for the Church and Truth, and Souls, is a most heynous aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Indeed while a poor blind Clergy man as his Trade, for applause and gain, doth
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:45238:70"/>
Study and Preach that Word of God which is against him, how dreadful is it to think, how all that he doth and saith is self-condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and that out of his own mouth he must be judged, and that all the woes which he pronounceth against Hypocrites, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent carnal worldly men, his own Tongue pronounceth them against himself.</p>
            <p n="12">§. 12. And when Satan hath once got such Instruments, how great an advantage hath he for the success against themselves, against the Flock, and against the Church and Cause of Christ, above what he might expect by other Servants.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are farre hardlier brought to Repentance than others.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Because they have by Wit and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, bended that Doctrine to defend their sin, which should be used to bring them to Repentance.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) And because their aggravated sin against Light, doth most forfeit that help of Grace which should work Repentance in them.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) And because being taken for Wise Learned men, and Preachers of Truth, and Teachers of others, and reprovers of Errors, their Reputation is much concerned in it, and their unhumbled Souls, which look all
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:45238:71"/>
others should Assent and Consent to their prescripts, will hardly be brought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse sin and Errour; but will sooner (as Papists) plead-infallibility, or conclude as some Councils have done that a Lay man must not accuse a Clergy man, be he never so bad. Repentance is hard to all men of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal interest, but to few more than to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humbled Clergy man.</p>
            <p>And 2. Whoever accuseth or reproveth them of sin, will be represented as an Enemy to the Church, &amp; a dishonourer of his Ghost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers, and one that openeth their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness which he should Cover: and so their Ulcers are as a <hi>noli me tangere</hi>; and fret as a Gangreen unremedied.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And their <hi>Place, Office, Titles,</hi> and Learning with many will give sin Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Advantage. If a Drunkard in the <hi>Alehouse</hi> deride Godly men, as Hereticks, Schismaticks, Hypocrites, or Puritanes, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber men will not much regard it: But they think they owe more belief and reverence, to a Learned Reverend Preacher in the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, even when he preacheth against preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and against those that practise what he teacheth them at other times. O how much of his work hath Satan done in the World by corrupting Sacred Offices, and by get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>HIS SERVANTS INTO RVLE and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:45238:71"/>
MINISTRY, TO DO HIS WORK AS FOR CHRIST,</hi> and his Church, and by his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and in his name. Our natural en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with the Serpent disswadeth him from speaking or sending to us in his own name. Should one say in the Pulpit [<hi>Thus saith the Devil, hate Christs servants; silence his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, call serious Godliness Hypocrisie,</hi>] (which is the contrary to Hypocrisie) I should not much fear his success with any. but if he be a lying Spirit in the mouth of <hi>Ahabs</hi> Prophets, and can get a Prophet to smite <hi>Michaiah</hi> for pretending to more of the Spirit than he had; or if he can get men in the Sacred Office to say (Thus saith the <hi>Lord</hi>) when they speak for sin or against the Lord, this is the Devils prosperous way.</p>
            <p n="13">§. 13. II. I have told you what Plagues bad Clergy men will be, and still have been to themselves, to the souls of men, and to the publick State of Churches and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; and were it not lest my Writing should be too large, I should tell you what Blessings on the contrary <hi>Able and Faithful Ministers</hi> are.</p>
            <p>Briefly 1. Christ maketh them the cheif instruments for the propagating of his Truth and Kingdom in the World, for the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Churches, and preserving and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending contradicted Truth. They are the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:45238:72"/>
Lights of the World, and the Salt of the Earth. All Christians are bound to teach or help each others in charity; but Christs Ministers are set in his Church (as Parents in Families) to do it by Office. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must be qualified above others for it, and be wholly dedicated to it, and attend continually on it; as a Physitian differeth from every Neighbour, who may help you in your sores or sickness as they can, so do the Pastors of the Church differ from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate helpers of your Souls. The Scripture is preserved and delivered down by the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate means of all the Faithful, but eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the publick Office of the Pastors. It may be expounded and applyed privately by any able Christian, but the Pastors do it eminently by Office; and to them especially (though to all Christians commonly) are committed the Oracles of God. The Priests lips must preserve knowledge, and men should enquire of the Law at his mouth; for he is the messenger of the Lord of Hosts, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. Never yet was the Gospel well propagated nor continued in any Country in the World, but by the means of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters of Christ: And O! what difference hath there been in their successes as they differed in ability, piety and diligence! And how great an honour is it to be such blessed
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:45238:72"/>
instruments of building up the house of God, and propagating the Gospel and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Christ, and the Christian Faith and Godliness in the World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And thus God useth them as his spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial instruments for the Convincing, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting, Edifying, Comforting and Saving of Souls. Others may be blest herein: But the special blessing goeth along with those that are specially obliged to the work; which is <hi>Parents</hi> in <hi>Families,</hi> and <hi>Pastors</hi> in the <hi>Church.</hi> O how many thousand Souls in Heaven, will for ever rejoyce in the effects of the Labours of Faithful Ministers, and bless God for them. And what an honour, what a comfort is it to have a hand in such a work. He that <hi>Converteth a sinner from the Errour of his way, doth save a Soul from death and cover a multitude of sins,</hi> Jam. <hi>last.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. And in this they are Co-workers with Jesus Christ the great Saviour of Souls, and with the Holy Spirit, the Regenerator and Sanctifier. Yea Christ doth very much of the work of his Salvation by them, <hi>when he ascended on high he gave gifts to men, for the edifying of his body, till they come to a perfect man</hi>; Eph. 4.6. to 16. and <hi>when the Chief Shephard shall appear, they shall receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.4. and shall hear <hi>well done good and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:45238:73"/>
Servant.</hi> Hence are the Streams of Conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, that make glad the City of God, and daily refresh many thousand precious Souls. For how shall men believe without a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and how shall they Preach unless they be sent (qualified, obliged and authorized by Christ) <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In a word Churches, States and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Kingdoms are chiefly blest and preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Labour of the faithful part of the Ministry: For (1) If we have the rare bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of a wise and holy and loving Magistracy, it is usually by the success of the labours of the Ministry. (2) And there is no better means to bring the Subjects to the Conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable performance of their Duty to Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours. (3) And by the blessing of their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the sins of a Nation are prevented or healed, which would else bring down Gods heavy Judgments. (4) They teach people to live in Love and Peace with one another, and to abhor Contention, Cruelty, Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, Injury, and Revenge, and all to do their several duties to promote the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Good. (5) When the ignorant and slothful and scandalous sort of bad Ministers betray Souls and would bring the Ministry and Religion into contempt, it is a wise and holy Ministry that counter-worketh them by labouring while others are idle, and doing
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:45238:73"/>
that wisely which others do foolishly, and shewing in their lives the power of that truth which others disgrace, and the reality of that Holiness, Love, Justice, Peace and Concord, which others would banish out of the World, by making it seem but a name or Image. (6) VVhen proud men tear the Church by the Engines of their domineering VVits and VVills, these humble Pastors as the servants of all, will labour to heal it, by Christian meekness and condescension: VVhen malignant Priests seek to strengthen themselves by the multitude of the ungodly, and to bring serious piety into contempt which doth molest them, these faithful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors open the just disgrace of sin, and the great necessity and honour of holiness, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring that vile persons may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, and those may be honoured that fear the Lord, <hi>Psal.</hi> 15.4. and distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the precious from the vile, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous from the wicked, and him that sweareth from him that feareth an Oath, and him that serveth God from him that serveth him not, God saith, They are <hi>as his mouth,</hi> Jer. 15.19. Mal. 3.17, 18. Eccl. 9.2.</p>
            <p>To be short, as <hi>An Ignorant, Worldly, Carnal, Proud, Vnholy sort of Prelates and Priests, are and have been the great Plague of the Churches these</hi> 1300 <hi>years</hi> at least, so
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:45238:74"/>
the <hi>Skilful, Holy, Humble, Faithful, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious, Patient Ministers of Christ, have been and still are, the great blessings of the World</hi>; for saving Souls, promoting Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Faith, Holiness, Love and Peace, opposing Errour, Pride, Oppression, VVorld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, Sensuality and Contention: diverting Gods Judgments by Faith and Prayer; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking all for Christ, and patiently suffering for well doing, and by Doctrine and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple teaching men to difference the Creator from the Creature, Holiness from Sin, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from Earth, Soul from the Body, the Spirit from the Flesh, and helping men to prepare by a mortified heavenly heart and life, for a comfortable death and endless happiness. Of such vast importance is it to the world whether the Clergy be good or bad, skilful or unskilful, holy or worldly; and he is not a true Christian that is insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the difference, or thinks it small.</p>
            <p>And now do I need to say any more, to shew young men designed for the Ministry of what importance it is that they be well prepared and qualified for it: God can and sometime doth turn VVolves into faithful Shepherds, and convert those, that being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted, undertake the work that should convert others, and give wisdom and grace to ignorant and graceless Preachers of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:45238:74"/>
and grace. But this is not ordinarily to be expected. But as youth is trained up and disposed, they commonly prove when they come to age: Their first notions lie deepest, and make way for their like; and resist all that is contrary be it never so true and good and necessary: Experience tells this to all the world: Those that in youth are trained in Heathenism, Mahometanism, Popery, or any distinct sect of Christians, they commonly continue such especially if they live among those who are for it, and so make it their Interest in reputation or wealth. And if the Rulers and Times should be but Erroneous, Heretical or Malignant, at en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to Truth and serious holiness, alas, how hard is it for ill-taught youth, to resist the Stream! How hard is it to unteach them the Errours which they first learnt! A Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit may easily bring up that which was but lately eaten, but the yellow and the green humors that lie deep, must cost heart-gripes, before they will be cast up. False Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as well as Truths are usually linkt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and the chain is neither easily cast off nor broken. And they that have received Errours, have received their defensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives: These are like the Shell-fish that carry their house about them. They have studied what to say for it, but not what can
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:45238:75"/>
be said against it: or which is worse, by a slight and false consideration of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for Truth they have disabled them from doing them any good.</p>
            <p>And if they had never so true Notions in their Memories, if they come not in power on their hearts, and make them not new, spiritual, holy men, these will not master fleshly Lusts, nor overcome ambitious and worldly Inclinations, nor make men fit to propagate that Faith and Holiness which they never had.</p>
            <p>And it is now that you must get those emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent qualifications of <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> which you must after use. And how will you use, that which you have not?</p>
            <p>And yet proud hearts, how empty soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, will be desirous of esteem and reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and will hardly bear vilifying, contempt or disregard. When as though some few prudent hearers will encourage such young men as they think are hopeful, yet most will judge of things and persons as they find them; The ignorant, dry and lifeless Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of unexperienced, carnal Preachers, will not be magnified by such as know what <hi>Iudgment</hi> and holy <hi>Seriousness</hi> that place and sacred work require. Few will much praise or feed on unsavoury or insippid Food, meerly to flatter and please the Cook.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="141" facs="tcp:45238:75"/>And then when you find that you are slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for your slight and unskilful work, your stomachs will rise against those that slight you, and so by selfishness you will turn ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, and become Enemies to those that you take for Enemies to you, because they are not contented with your unholy trifling: And all your enmity will turn against your self, and be like Satans against the members of Christs which is but his own self-tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting.</p>
            <p n="15">§. 15. II. The Case being so important I shall briefly conjoyn your <hi>Danger</hi> and your <hi>Remedy,</hi> beseeching you as you have any care for your Souls, your Country, or the Church of God, or any thing which Faith or reason should regard, that you will soberly weigh the Counsel that I give you.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The first of your dangers which I shall mention lieth in a <hi>too hasty resolving</hi> for the <hi>Sacred Ministry.</hi> Pious and prudent desires and purposes I would not discourage: But two sorts of Parents in this prove great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly injurious to the Church: First, Worldly men, that set their Sons to the Universities in order to their worldly Maintenance and Preferment, looking at the Ministry meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as a Profession or Trade to live by; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, and many honest, godly Parents ignorantly think it a good work to design
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:45238:76"/>
their Children to the Ministry, and call it a <hi>devoting them to God,</hi> without due consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether they are like to be fit for it or not. And when they have bin some years at the University, they think a Parsonage or Vicarage is their due; Ordained they must be; what have they else studied for: Its too late now to change their purposes, when they have been at seven years cost and labour, to prepare for the Ministry: They are too old and too proud to go Apprentices or Servants. Husbandmen they cannot be. They are used to an idler kind of Life. To be Lawyers will cost them more time and study than they can now afford having lost so much: and there are more already than can have practice. Physicians are already so many that the younger sort know not how to live, though they would for money venture on their Neighbours lives to their greater danger than I am willing to express. So that there is no way left but for a Benefice to become Church Mountebanks and Quacks, and undertake the Pastoral care of Souls: before they well know what Souls are, or what they are made for, or whither they are going, or how they must be conducted and prepared for their endless state. And it seems to some, the glory of a Nation, to have many thousand such Lads at the Universities
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:45238:76"/>
more than there be Cures or Churches in the Land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all expecting that their Friends should procure them Benefices. And they must be very ignorant and bad indeed that cannot find some Ministers so bad as to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie that they are sober and of good lives, and some Patrons so bad as to like such as they, and for favour or somewhat worse to present them; and some Bishops Chaplain bad enough to be favourable in examining them, and then some Bishop bad enough to ordain and institute them. And by that time nine Thousand such youths have got Benefices, alas, what a case will the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and the poor peoples Souls be in.</p>
            <p n="16">§. 16. I. And what remedy is there for this? That which I have now to propose is, first to tell you, <hi>who they be, that should be devoted to the Ministry,</hi> and next what both Parents and you should do.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The work is so high, and requireth such qualifications, and miscarrying in it is of such dreadful consequence, that no youth should be resolvedly devoted to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry, that hath not all these following en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments?</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) He must have a good natural Wit and Capacity; it should be somewhat above the ordinary degree; but it must needs be of the better rank of ordinary wits, for Grace
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:45238:77"/>
supposeth nature; and by sanctifying it turns it the right way; but doth not use to make wise Teachers of natural drones or weak headed lads, that have not wit enough to Learn. How many and how great things have they to learn and teach.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) They must have some competent readiness of speech, to utter the knowledge they have got. One that cannot readily speak his mind in common things, is not like to come to that ready utterance which will be necessary to a Preacher.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) He must be one that is so far hopeful for Godliness.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to be captivated by no gross sin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To have a love not only to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but to Religion, to the Word of God, and good Company, and Prayer, and good Books; and a setled dislike of the things, words and persons that are against these.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) And he must shew some sence of the concerns or his soul, and regard of the Life to come, and that his Conscience is under some effectual convictions of the evil of sin, and the goodness and necessity of a godly Life. The youth that hath not these three qualifications, should not be intended or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the Ministry. To devote an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable person, an ungodly person, to such a holy state and work is worse than of old
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:45238:77"/>
to have offered God the unclean which he abhorred for a sacrifice. And to design a graceless Lad for the Ministry on pretence of hoping that he may have Grace hereafter is a presumptious profanation, and worse than to design a Coward to be a Soldier, a wicked unsuitable person to be a Husband or Wife, in hope they may be fit here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p n="17">§. 17. II. Therefore if your Parents have been so unwise as to devote that to God which was unfit for his acceptance, it concerneth you quickly to look better to your selves, and not to run into the consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire. You should be conscious of your own condition; If you may know that you want.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A competency of natural capacity and ingenuity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Or of ready speech.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Or of serious piety, love to godliness, and heart devotedness to God, do not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with that calling which requireth all these.</p>
            <p n="18">§. 18. <hi>Obj.</hi> But (you may say) <hi>What shall we do, we have gone so farre that we are fit for nothing else.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> You are less fit for the Ministry than for any thing. That which requireth the highest qualifications, will most shame
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:45238:78"/>
you and condemn you if you want them. If you are not fit for Physick or Law, be some great mans Servant; if not that, its better that you turn to the basest Trade or laborious imployment, than to run into the sad case of <hi>Hophni,</hi> and <hi>Phinehas,</hi> or <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi>! to the utter undoing of your selves and the loss and danger of many others. But if your unfitness be not in your <hi>disability</hi> but your <hi>ungodliness,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you be Ministers or not, you will be for ever miserable unless you consider well the great things that should change your Hearts and Lives, and turn unfeignedly to God: and when that is done, I am no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courager of you. But believe, it it is farre better to be a Cobler, or Chimney sweeper, or to beg your bread, than to be an <hi>ungodly Clergy man,</hi> with the greatest preferments, riches and applause.</p>
            <p n="19">§. 19. Obj. <hi>But (Parents may say) If we devote none to the Ministry till Godliness appear in them, how few will be so devoted, Children seldom shew much savour of Religion, and some that seem young Saints prove old De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. At the present we have so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny supernumeraries, that we need not fear a want of number.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Children cannot be expected to shew
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:45238:78"/>
that understanding in Religion which men must have. But if they shew not a Love to it, and a Conscience regardful of Gods au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and the Life to come, and a dislike of ungodliness and sin, you have no reason to presume that they will be fit for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry. If they had never been baptized, you ought not to baptize them in such a state. They must credibly profess <hi>Faith</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance before they can be adult Christians, and so dedicated to God in baptism, much more before they are dedicated to him as the Guides of the Christian Churches.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And you can judge but according to probabilities, if they prove bad after a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable profession, it will not be charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you; but we all know that a hopeful youth is a great preparation to an honest age.</p>
            <p n="20">§. 20. II. My next advise to you is, <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre sloth and idleness,</hi> when you are at Countrey Schools, your Masters drive you on by fear, but when you are in the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities and at riper age, you are more trusted with your selves: and then all the diligence which fear constrained, will be left off, and if you be not carryed on with constant <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> and love of knowledge, the flesh will preferre its ease, and unwillingness, and weariness will go so slow a pace, as will
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:45238:79"/>
bring you to no high degree of Wisdom. And when you have spent your appointed time, and are void of that, which you should have attained, your emptiness and ignorance will presently appear, when you are called out to the use of that knowledge which you have not. And it is not your Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Habit, nor seven or seventeen years spent in the University, nor the Title of Master of Arts, Batchelor of Divinity, or Doctor, no nor Bishop, that will pass with men, in their right wits, instead of <hi>Knowledge, Diligence, Humility, Patience,</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi>; nor that without these will do the work to which you are devoted. And then when you find that other men discern that weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and badness, which you are loth to know your selves, it will be like to exaspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate you into diabolical malignity. Beleive it, the high and needful accomplishments of a true Divine, are not easily or speedily at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <p n="21">§. 21. III. My next warning is, <hi>Fear and fly from sensuality, and Fleshly lusts, and all the baits and Temptations, that may endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger you therein.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sence and Appetite is born with us, and it is <hi>inordinate</hi> in our corrupted nature, and the <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>will,</hi> that should resist and rule it, are weakened and depraved; labouring
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:45238:79"/>
poor Countrey men are not in such danger in this as you are: your bodies are not tired and tamed with labours nor your thoughts taken up with Wants and Cares. While your bodies are at ease, and your Studies are Arbitrary, fleshly lust and appetite hath time and room to sollicite your phantasies, and incline you to interrupt your Studies, and think of the matters of sensual delight, either with what to please your Appetite in eating, or of strong drinks or wine that also exhilarates, or of some needless or hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pastime called Recreation, Cards, Dice, Gaming, &amp;c. or to think of Women and filthy Lusts, or to read Romances, Play-Books or other corrupting vanities. More idle Scholars far, are strongly haunted with Temptations to self-pollution, and other filthy lusts, than the poor and afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed sort of men.</p>
            <p>And if these should prevail, alas! you are undone, they will offend God, expell his Grace, either wound or seare your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, destroy all spiritual affections and delights, turn down your hearts from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Holiness, to filth and folly; and Beasts will be unfit for the pleasures or the work of Saints.</p>
            <p n="22">§. 22. Away therefore from idleness, pamper not the Flesh with fulness or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:45238:80"/>
abhorre all time wasting, needless Recreations; away from the baits of fleshly lust; be no more indifferent herein and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolved, than you would be about drinking poyson, or leaping into a Coal-pit, or will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully going among Murderers or Theives. Presume not on your own strength: he is safest that is furthest from the danger. Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder must not stand near the fire.</p>
            <p n="23">§. 23. IV. Be sure to make <hi>a prudent choice of your Companions, especially of your bosom Friends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is supposed that a man <hi>loveth</hi> the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which he chooseth, (though not which he constrainedly is cast upon.) And <hi>love</hi> and <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity</hi> will give them great advantage over you. If they be wise they will teach you wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, if they be Holy &amp; Spiritual, they will be drawing you towards God, and setling you in the resolved hatred of sin, and love of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness. But if they be Worldly and Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, they will be filling your heads with am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious worldly projects; and if they be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Hypocrites that have but the dead image and name of Christians, they will be opposing or deriding serious Godliness, and pleading for the carkass and formalities of piety as better than serious spiritual devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and if they be hardned malignants, they will be trying to make you such as they by lies, revilings or plausible cavils, against
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:45238:80"/>
the things and persons that are spiritually contrary to their fleshly minds and interests. And while you hear not what can be said on the other side, it will possess your minds (if God preserve you not) with false thoughts of Gods Servants, and with scorn or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of such as you hear described falsly; as Papists think of Protestants as Hereticks, you will take serious Godliness, for Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical self-conceit, and think of the best Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians as you do of Quakers or others, that are mad with fear or pride.</p>
            <p>Wise and Religious Companions and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som Friends are an unspeakable blessing, but the merciful Providence of God doth usually choose them for us, yet so as that usually we must also be faithful choosers for our selves. Ill company is a dangerous snare, and God often tryeth us by casting us where such are, but if we choose it not, and love it not, God will provide us of an antidote, and we may converse with him even in the presence of the ungodly, and he will teach us by the experience of their folly, and sin, to dislike it more than if we had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver seen it.</p>
            <p n="24">§. 24. V. <hi>Especially be most careful in the choice of your Tutors and Instructors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though it be first your Parents part to choose them for you, it is yours to do your
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:45238:81"/>
best herein, to save your selves if your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents by ignorance or malignity do mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choose. And the Rulers that allow not men to choose their own Pastors, yet hitherto allow the Parents or the Sons to choose their own Tutors, and Domestick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structors.</p>
            <p>But this is the grand danger and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of mankind, that the ignorant know not what Teachers to choose: Yea the more they need the help of the best, the less they know who those are; but i'le tell you are far as you are capable of discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Usually the common report of men that are sober and impartial commendeth worthy men above others, for Knowledge and Goodness is like Light, a self discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Choose not a Teacher that preferreth humane Wisdom before Divine, but one that maketh it his business to expound the Scripture, and teach you what is the Will of God, and how to please him and to be saved.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Choose not one that is of a worldly and ambitions mind; and will teach you that which most conduceth to get prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and worldly wealth, and not that which best helpeth you to Heaven.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="153" facs="tcp:45238:81"/>4, Choose not one that is <hi>Factious</hi> and <hi>uncharitable,</hi> violent for a <hi>Party,</hi> either because it is uppermost, or because it stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for some odd opinion or causeless singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but one that is of a Christian Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick charity, and loveth a godly man as such, even as himself, and is for wronging none. but doing good to all, and maintaining Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Peace.</p>
            <p n="25">§. 25. VI, <hi>Watch with great fear against Pride, Ambition and Worldly ends, in your own hearts and lives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The roots of these mortal sins, are born in us, and lie very deep. And they not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>live,</hi> but damnably <hi>reign</hi> where they are little discerned, bewailed or suspected; but woe to him that is conquered by them. Ye cannot serve God and Mammon. The love of the World is enmity to God, if any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him, <hi>Paul</hi> spake weeping of such <hi>whose God was their Belly, who gloried in their shame, who minded earthly things, being Enemies to the cross of Christ,</hi> when their Conversation should have been in Heaven, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18, 19, 20. A surprize in passion even of an ugly sin, is less dangerous than such an habit of worldliness and pride. And alas how many that have escaped the Temptations of sloth and sensuality, have
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:45238:82"/>
been flattered and overcome by this. Those that have had better wits than others, and got more Learning, have thought now that preferment is their due. And if they fall into times (which have not been rare) when the malignity of Church or State Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, it hath made it the way to preferment to declaim against some Truth, or the most Religious men, that are against a carnal sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful interest, and to revile Gods best Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and cry up some notion or errour of their own, and magnifie the worst that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their worldly ends and hopes, alas! how doth this stream usually carry down the pregnantest wits into the Gulf of perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</p>
            <p>Yea some that seemed very humble and mortified when they had no great Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; when wealth and honour have been set before them, have lost vertue and wit before they were well aware. And world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interest hath secretly bribed and byassed their understandings, to take the greatest Truth for Errour, Duty for Sin, and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour for Truth, and Sin for Duty, and they have talkt, and preacht, and wrote for it, and seem to believe that indeed they are in the right; and cannot discern that they are perverted by interest, when an impartial stander by, may easily see the byass, by the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:45238:82"/>
of their course. And if you be servants of the flesh and the world, woe to you when your Masters turn you off, and you must receive your wages.</p>
            <p n="26">§. 26. VII. Above all therefore <hi>choose like real Christians, and take God and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for your hope, your all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you do not so you are not Christians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, nor stand to your baptismal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and if you be here fixed by the Grace of God, and your sober consideration and belief, you will then know what to choose and do. It will teach you to referre all worldly things to spiritual and heavenly ends and uses; and to count all things loss and dung for Christ, and to choose the one thing needful, which shall never be taken from you; even that which will guide you in just and safe ways, and save you from the greatest evil, and give your minds continual peace, even that which passeth understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and will be best at last, when sinners are forsaken.</p>
            <p n="27">§. 27. VIII. My next Counsel therefore is for the order of your Studies; <hi>Begin then with your Catechism and practical Divinity, to settle your own Souls in a safe condition for Life or Death.</hi> And deal not so foolishly as to wast many years in inferior Arts and
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:45238:83"/>
Sciences, before you have Studied how to please God and to be saved. I unfeignedly thank God that by sickness and his Grace, he called me early to learn how to Die, and therefore to Learn what I must be and how to live, and thereby drew me to Study the Sacred Scriptures, and abundance of practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal spiritual English Books, till I had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what setled the resolution, and the peace of my own Soul, before I had gone farre in humane Learning: and then I found more leisure and more capacity to take in subser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient knowledge in its proper time and place. And indeed I had lost most of my Studies of Philosophy and difficult contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies in Theology; if I had faln on them too young, before I came to due capacity, and so had been prepossessed with crude or unsound notions, for they had kept out that which required a riper judgment to recieve it. Such Books as I before commended to the Apprentices contain the Essentials of Religion, plainly, affectionately, and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctically delivered, in a manner tending to deep impression, renovation of the Soul and spiritual experience, without which you will be but like sounding brass or a tinkling Cymbal. The Art of Theology without the <hi>POWER,</hi> consisting in Holy Life, and Light, and Love, is the make of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:45238:83"/>Yet before you come to lay <hi>exact Systems of Theology in due Method</hi> in your minds, much help of subservient Arts and Sciences is necessary. How ever a Council of ancient Bishops once forbad the Reading of the Gentiles Books.</p>
            <p n="28">§. 28. IX. And here next I advise you, <hi>Throughly to Study the Evidences and nature of the Christian Faith, but not to hasten too soon over confidently on hard controversies, as if your judgment of them at maturity, must have no change; but still suppose that greater light by longer Study may cause in you much different thoughts of such difficulties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="29">§. 29. Lastly, I advise you, <hi>that you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin not the exercise of your Ministry too boldly, in publick, great or judicious Auditories.</hi> Over much confidence signifieth Pride and Ignorance of your imperfection, and of the greatness of the work, and the dreadfulness of the most Holy Majesty. But (if you can) at first <hi>settle a competent time in the house with some ancient experienced Pastor, that hath some small Country Chappel, that needs your help.</hi> And</p>
            <p n="1">1. There you may <hi>Learn</hi> as well as <hi>Teach,</hi> and learn by his practice that which you must practice, which in a great house as a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:45238:84"/>
you will hardly do, but must cast your self into a farre different mould.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By Preaching some years to a small ignorant people where you fear not critical judgments, you will get boldness of speech, and freedom of utterance, without that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Study of words, and learning your written notes without Book, which will be <hi>tiresome, time-wasting</hi> and <hi>lifeless.</hi> And when freedom and use hath brought you to a habit of ready speaking of the great and necessary things, and acquaintance with ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Countrey people hath taught you to understand their case, you will have a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter preparation for more publick places (when you are clearly called to them) than you were ever like to get either in Universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, among Schollars, or in great mens Houses.</p>
            <p>Compassion to the Church that is plagued with bad Ministers, and by the <hi>weak</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go exceeding great loss, and the sence of the grand importance of the Pastors qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to the happiness or misery of Souls and Kingdoms, have drawn me to say more to young Students that intend the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry than I at first intended. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with the other two sorts I shall be very brief.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:45238:84"/>☞ One earnest warning to you, and all young men, I adde, [know that one of the most common and pernicious maladies of mankind,] is an unhumbled understanding, rashly confident of its own apprehensions, though false, hasty judging and presidence, the brat of Ignorance and Pride; Of a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of persons differing, how few are not obstinately confident that they are in the right. even Lads that are past twenty years of age; O! dread this Vice, and suspect your understanding: Be humble, take time &amp; trie, and hear before you judge: Labour for knowledge, but take not on you to be sure where you are not, but doubt and trie till you are sure.</p>

            <head>CHAP. X. Counsel to Young Students in Physick.</head>
            <p>SUpposing what is said to others, which equally concerneth you, I briefly add.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Make not the getting of Money, and
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:45238:85"/>
your own worldly prosperity, so much of your end as the doing good in the world, by the preservation of mens health and lives, and the pleasing of God thereby. Selfish low ends shew a selfish mind, that liveth not to God or publick good.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Undertake not the practice of Physick without all these qualifications.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A special sagacity, or natural search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conjecturing judgment. For almost all your work lyeth in the dark, and is manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Conjecture.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Much Reading, especially of Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators, that you may know what hath been the experience of all ages, and eminent men before you.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The experience of other mens prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: And therefore if possible, stay some time first in the house with some eminent Practitioner, whose experiences you may see, and hear his counsel.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Begin with plain and easy cases, and meddle only with safe and harmless reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; And think not your selves Physicians indeed, till you have got considerable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience your selves, there is no satisfactory trusting to other mens experiences alone.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. In cases too hard for you, send your Patients to abler Physicians, and prefer not your reputation or gain before their lives.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:45238:85"/>V. Study simples throughly, especially the most powerful; and affect not such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, as by the mixture of the less po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful, do frustrate the ingredients, which would else be more effectual.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Forget not the Poverty of most Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, who have not Money to pay large chargeable Bills of the Apothecary, nor give large Fees to a Physician; multitudes neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Physick and venture without it, because Physicians require so much, and are so much for their Apothecaries gain, that they have it not to pay.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Take heed of self conceitedness and rash confidence, and too hasty judging. Most of your work is hard; many things, which you think not on, may occasion your mistake. Causes and Diseases have marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous diversities. Most that are quick judges, and suddenly confident that all their first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions are true, do prove but proud self-ignorant fools, and kill more by ignorances and temerity, than high-way robbers or designing Murderers do. And though the Grave hide you mistakes, they are known to God.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Give not too <hi>much Physick</hi> nor too often, or without need, nor venture on things dangerous; Mans life is precious, and nature is the chief Physician, which

Art must but help. The Body is tender and easily distempered, rather do too little than too much. Oft tampering useth to kill at last. As he that dayly washeth a glass, at last breaketh it; and as Seamen are bold because they have oft escaped, but many, if not most, are drown'd at last; and as Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that have oft escaped are bold to venture, but kill'd at last. Its usually so with them that oft take Physick except from a very cautelous skillful man. Therefore were I a Woman I would not marry a Physitian, lest his nearness and kindness should cause him to be tampering with me so oft, till a mistake did kill me: All your Neighbours may mistake your Disease without your hurt, but your Physitians mistake may be your present Death.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Direct men first as faithful Friends, to the things which may prevent the need of Physick. viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A temperate and wholesome Diet, avoiding fullness and hurtful things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sufficient labour to suscitate natural heat, keep pure the humors, and expell excrements; avoiding Idleness.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Keeping warm, and avoiding occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Cold, especially cold Drink, cold Places, and cold Cloathing, either when they are hot, or in Winter when nature needeth help.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:45238:86"/>4. Contentedness and quietness of mind, and chearful converse.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Direct them to such familiar reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies at home, in their Drinks and Diet as is suitable to their distempers, for preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and are safe and harmless, and put them not to a needless dependance on your frequent help, make not use of weak Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens fears, to make them miserable by needless Medicining, and so to make them as Tenants to you, to pay you a constant Rent to quiet them.</p>
            <p n="10">X. Give them good Counsel for their Souls that need it; flatter them not with false hopes of life, when it tendeth to hinder their preparations for Death. They and you are hasting to so great a change, as requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth great and careful forethoughts: Its sad to go out of the World, and not at all to know whither, and what will be their next habitation; much more to be in a certain state of misery. Those will hear a Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an that will not send for a Divine, and it is not a work unbeseeming your Profession, but such as Christian Faith and Charity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speaks.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XI. Counsel to Young Students of the Law in London.</head>
            <p>GOD hath made much use of honest Lawyers, as the instruments of our safety, and of the just and orderly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Land.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are not bred up in meer idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Luxury, as too many are of higher Birth, but in such diligent Study as improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their understandings, and keepeth them from that debauchery which Idleness and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness cherish.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And their Studies and Callings make it their interest, as to know, so also to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Laws; and that is to maintain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, just Liberty and Order, and so to preserve justice and the common peace (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in Countries that have pernicious Laws) Injustice in Judges and Lawyers is like He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, ungodliness and persecution in Pastors of the Church; clean contrary to their very Calling and Profession; but more easily and commonly seen and hated, because it is
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:45238:87"/>
against the well known interest of mankind. Shame therefore and common hatred of the unjust, is here a great restraint of evil.</p>
            <p>But bad men, for all this, will do badly, and turn even the Rules of Justice to Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, to serve the Wills and Lusts of those that can promote them, that by them they may serve their own. Therefore that Young men, that Study the Law, may prove wise and honest, is of great importance to the common good, as well as to their own.</p>
            <p n="1">I. And here first I warn all such to take heed of the sins of sensuality. Alas! <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> doth so abound with Temptations, that without Grace and wise Resolution you are unsafe. There are so many sensual, proud, and ungodly young men ready to entice you, so many Play Houses, Taverns, and Filthy Houses to entertain you, that if you go without Grace and Wit, the Flesh and the Devil, will soon precipitate you into the sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of brutish Flesh. And then you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit Gods favour and protection, and he may leave you to more sin and misery, or to grow up to be the Servants of Oppression, the Enemies of Piety, and the Plagues of the Commonwealth.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Study hard</hi>; for Idleness never made good Lawyers, nor very useful men.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:45238:88"/>III. Abhorre and avoid ill Company, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of two sorts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Those that would entice you to the places, and practises, aforesaid, of voluptuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Those that being themselves deceived would deceive you, against Religion and your Salvation. Its too well known that such persons in <hi>London</hi> are not rare, though the danger by them is not known enough. Even those that are so unchristian and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, as to prate against the Christian Faith, the Truth, the Authority or sufficiency of the Sacred Scripture, the Life to come, the Souls immortality, if not also against the Government and Providence of God, will yet talk as confidently, as if they were in their wits, yea and were the greatest wits among us. For my part I could never yet get one man of them soberly to joyn with me in a fair disquisition of the Truth, and follow it on till we came to see the just con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion: Commonly they will fly from me, and refuse disputes, or turn all to some rambling rant or jest, or when they are stated, be gone and go no further, and come no more.</p>
            <p>Young unfurnished heads are unfit to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with the Devil or any such Messengers of his. A Pest house is not more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:45238:88"/>
to you. But if they have perplexed you, desire some well studied Minister of Christ, either to meet them, or to resolve your doubts. And if you will read what I have written on that subject, you may find enough to resolve, if it be justly received, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. In my <hi>Reasons for the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. In my <hi>Vnreasonableness of Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. In my <hi>Life of Faith.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. In <hi>More Reasons for the Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And avoid also the snares of those that would draw you into <hi>uncharitable Factions,</hi> on pretense of right Religion, to hate, or censure, or fly from all that are not just of their Sect and way; especially the proud faction of Church-Tyrants, that on pretence of Order and Piety, would set up a lifeless Image of Formality, and burn, banish, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, or persecute all that are not for Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, and Usurpation, and Worldly interest.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Let not rising and riches be the chief end of your Studies, but to serve God in the just service of your King and Country, to promote justice, and do good in the World.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:45238:89"/>V. Live in the familiarity of the most useful men of your Profession, that is, the wise and the most conscionable; and choose those Pastors for your best helpers in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, who keep closest to Gods word, and warp not after any dangerous singularities, or worldly preferments, or unpeaceable tearing impositions on their Brethren; and that live as they Preach in Love, Peace and Holiness, as men that set their Hearts and Hopes on future Blessedness; and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for the Churches Edification and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and the saving mens Souls.</p>

         <div n="12" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. XII. Counsel to the Sons of the Nobility and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates.</head>
            <p>THough men of your rank, are furthest out of the hearing of such as I, and usually the greatest contemners of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, yet will not that excuse us from due com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion to the Land our of Nativity, nor
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:45238:89"/>
from Love and Pity to your selves, nor from any probable Ministerial attempt to do you good.</p>
            <p>Your dangers are much greater than other mens; or else Christ had never so often told us, <hi>how hard it is for Rich men to be saved</hi>; and how few such escape the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous damning Love of the World, and become sincere believers and followers of a Crucified Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. and 16. &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="1">I. One part of your great danger is, that you are commonly bred up among the baits of sensuality. It is not for nothing that <hi>fulness</hi> of <hi>bread</hi> is made one of the sins of <hi>Sodom, Ezek.</hi> 16.49. and that he that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lay in the flames of Hell is described, as <hi>richly cloathed and faring sumptuously every day.</hi> Not that all rich Cloathes or <hi>sumptuous seasonable Feasting</hi> is a sin, but that these use both to <hi>signifie sensuality</hi> and to <hi>cherish</hi> it. Its the sure brand of the ungodly, to be <hi>Lovers of Pleasure more than of God.</hi> They that but seldom come where tempting plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is, of delicious meats and drinks are too often overcome: But they that are bred up, where plenty of both these is daily before them, are in greater danger, lest their Table and their Drink become a snare.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:45238:90"/>Feast not therefore without fear, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that flesh-pleasing sensuality is as damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the rich as in the poor, and that the greatest wealth will not allow you to take any more for quantity or quality, than standeth with Temperance, and truly tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to fit you for your duty, your riches are given you in trust as God's Stewards, to serve your Countrey, and relieve the poor, and to promote good uses, but not to serve your fleshly lusts, nor to be abused to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess or cherish sin. To be sober and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate is the interest of your own Souls and Bodies, and under your great Temptations the more laudable.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Another of your dangers is the <hi>ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of too many persons of your rank.</hi> You are apt to think that their wealth and Pomp and Power makes them more imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than others, as being more Honourable. And if they wallow in drunkenness or filthy lust, or talk prophanely, you may think that such sins are the less <hi>disgraceful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But can you dream that they are the less Dangerous and Damnable. Will God fear them or spare them. Must they not die and be judged as well as the lowest. Is it not an aggravation of their sin, that its done by men that had the greatest Mercies, and were put in trust and honour purposely to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:45238:90"/>
suppress sin in the World. As their places signifie more than others, so do their sins; and accordingly shall they be punished: Doth the <hi>quondam</hi> Wealth, Honour or Pleasures of a <hi>Dives,</hi> a <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> an <hi>Ahab,</hi> a <hi>Herod,</hi> a <hi>Pilate,</hi> a <hi>Nero,</hi> ease a lost tormented Soul.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Another of your Temptations will be <hi>Pride,</hi> and overvaluing of your selves, because of wealth and worldly honour. But this is so foolish a sin and against such notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humbling evidence, that as it is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Image, it is natures shame. Is not your flesh as corruptible as a Beggars. Do you not think what is within that skin? And how a Leprosie, or the Small Pox, would make you look, and how you must shortly leave all your glory, and your bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come unpleasant spectacles? Do you not think what it is to lye rotting in a Grave and turn to Earth? And do you not know how much more loathsome a thing all the Vice and Unholiness of your Souls is; And what it is to have to do with a Holy God, and to be near to judgment and an endless State. He is mad in sin that such considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will not humble.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Another of your dangers is from <hi>flatterers,</hi> that will be <hi>pleasing and praising</hi> you, but never tell you of that which should <hi>humble you</hi> and <hi>awake you,</hi> to the sence of your
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:45238:91"/>
Everlasting concerns. But none here are so dangerous as a <hi>Flattering Clergy,</hi> who being themselvs carnal worldlings would serve that flesh which is their Master, by your Favour and Beneficence. <hi>Ahab</hi> had such Prophets that said go and prosper; in whose mouths the Devil was a lying Spirit. How many sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere men have been undone by such.</p>
            <p>Remember then what it is to be a sinful man, and what need you have of vigilant Friends and Pastors, that will deal faithfully with you, as if it were on your death Bed: And encourage such, and abhorre worldly flatterers. Your Souls have need of as strong Physick, and as plain dealing as the poorest mens, and therefore bear it, and thankfully accept it.</p>
            <p n="5">V. And one of your greatest dangers here will be, that <hi>your own</hi> fleshly minds and this worldly sort of men, especially if of the Clergy, will be drawing you to false contemptuous thoughts of serious Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and of serious godly men. When as if you be not such your selves you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever, and all your flatterers, your big Names, Wealth and Honour will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther save you nor ease your pains in Hell. As ever you believe there is a God, believe that you owe him the utmost reverence, obedience and love, that your faculties can
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:45238:91"/>
perform. And as ever you care what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of you for ever, pay him this great due, and hate all that would divert you; and much more all those diabolical suggesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which would draw you to think that a needless thing which must be your life and all.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. But above all I beseech you fear and watch, lest you be drawn to <hi>espouse any thing as your interest, which is against the interest, and command of Christ, and against his Kingdom, or the good of his Church, or the Commonwealth.</hi> As the Devil first undid the World, by making deceived <hi>Eve</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that Gods command was against her interest, so doth he to this day, but with none so much as with Nobles and Rich men. God hath commanded you nothing but what is for your own good, nor forbidden you any thing but what is for your own and others hurt. He needs not you or any; but you must allow him to be God, and therefore to be wiser and better than you, &amp; to know better what is best &amp; fittest for you and others: But Satan will slander to you Gods Laws, Ways and Servants; for he is for your enmity and separation from God, and therefore would draw you to believe, that that he and his ways are Enemies to you, and against your pleasure, honour, domination,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:45238:92"/>
commodity or ease. O how many Princes and Great Men have been utterly undone, by believing the Flesh, the Devil and his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, that Christianity is against their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, honour or other interests, and that the Scripture is too precise, and that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, obeying God before them, is against their power and prerogative, and so have set them as Enemies to keep under Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and serious godliness, lest obedience to their wills be thereby hindred.</p>
            <p>Yea how many also so dote, as to think that the interest of Head, Heart, Stomack and Members, of Rulers and Subjects, stand not in Union, but in contrariety and victory against each other. Wo to the Land that hath such Rulers, and to the poor Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants that have such Land-Lords. But much more wo to such selfish oppressours, that had rather be feared than loved, and take it for their honour to be free and able to do mischief, and destroy those, whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon welfare should be more pleasant to them than their own. And to them especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that take serious godliness, and godly men to be against them, and therefore bend their wit and power to suppress them; as if they said as Luke 19.27. We will not have this man reign over us, whom Christ will destroy as his unthankful Enemies, and
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:45238:92"/>
will break them with his Iron rod, and dash in peices as a potters vessel, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. As you love your selves and the common good, get good men about you, read <hi>Ps.</hi> 101.15, 16. Especially faithful teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and next godly Friends and Servants, and Companions, and read much the Histories of the Lives of wise and Godly men, such as K. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6th. and the Lord <hi>Harrington,</hi> young men, imitate such excellent persons as Scripture and other History justly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to your imitation. It will be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to read the Lives of worthy men, such as are gathered by Mr. <hi>Clerk,</hi> Dr. <hi>Fuller, Thuanus, Beza,</hi> yea of the Martyrs; and of such Christian Princes as <hi>Constantine</hi> M. <hi>Theodosius,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Maximilian</hi> 2d. Emperor, <hi>Iohn Frederick</hi> of <hi>Saxony, Philip</hi> of <hi>Has<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia, Ludov. Pius</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> yea such Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens as <hi>Titus, Trajan, Adrian,</hi> but espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially M. <hi>Aurel. Antonine</hi> and <hi>Alex. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus:</hi> Yea and such Lawyers, Philosophers, Physicians, but especially Divines, as <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chior Adamus</hi> in Four Volums hath recorded; and of such Bishops as <hi>Cyprian, Nazianzene, Ambrose Austin, Basil, Chrysostome,</hi> and our <hi>Vsher</hi> and such others.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Live not in <hi>Idleness</hi> (as the Sons of rich men too oft do) for that will rust and corrupt your minds, and cherish besotting,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:45238:93"/>
damning lusts, and render you worthless and useless in the world, and consequently the greatest plagues of your Country, to which you should be the greatest helps and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings. Make as much Conscience of improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your hours, as if you were the poorest men: you have most wages, and should do God most work. Let holy and useful studies one part of the day, and doing good to others another part, and necessary refreshment and exercise another, take up your time; you have none allowed you for any thing unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, much less hurtfull.</p>
            <p>O what a blessing to the world are wise Godly Magistrates, and what a curse are the Foolish and Ungodly.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Remember that the grand design of the Devil and all deceivers is to delude and corrupt the rulers of the people, knowing how much they signifie by their Laws, Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Examples: and how sad it will be to be judged as a Persecutor or a Captain of iniquity. And therefore you must have a greater self-suspicion, and fear of seduction and sin than others; and must watch more carefully against wicked Counsel and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but especially the Temptations of your own flesh, and corrupted nature, and of your VVealth and place.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XIII. Counsel to Parents (and Tutors of Youth.)</head>
            <p>SHould I now say, to Parents and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, what on their parts is necessary, to their great duty, and the good of Youth, it would be more than all that I have said already; but that is not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent work, and you may see much of it done in my <hi>Christian Directory.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause so much lyeth on their hands, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech all such that read these lines, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</p>
            <p n="1">I. How near their relation to their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren is, and that for a Parent to betray their Souls to Sin and Hell, by neglect or by ill means, seems more unexcusable cruelty, than for the Devil a known Enemy to do it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. How very much their welfare is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted to your care, you have the Teaching of them before the Ministers, and have them alwaies nearer with you, and have greater power over them. O! that you
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:45238:94"/>
knew what holy instructions, and heavenly excitations and good example God requireth of you for their good: And how much of the hopes of the Church and World lie on the Holy skill and fidelity of Parents, in the right education of youth.</p>
            <p n="3">III. O feed not their sinful desires and lusts; use them not to pride, to idleness, to too much fulness or pleasing of the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite; but teach them the reasons of Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and Mortification, and the sin and mischief of all sensuality.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Yet use them with tender fatherly Love, and make them perceive that it is for their own good, and cherish their profitable delights; study how to make all good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to them, encourage and reward them. Tell them of the wisdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Gods word, and let them read the Lives of Holy men.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Choose <hi>them</hi> both <hi>Callings, Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>Relations</hi> which make most for the common good, and for the advantage of their Souls, and not those that most serve Covetousness, Pride or Slothfulness.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. Know their particular inclinations, corruptions and temptations, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly watch and keep them, as you would do against death.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:45238:94"/>VII. Settle them under wise and godly Pastors, and in the familiar Company of godly persons, especially of their age and usual converse.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Keep them as much as possible from Temptations at home and abroad, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially those that tend to <hi>sensuality</hi> and to <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety</hi> or corrupting their judgments against Religion. Thrust them not beyond Sea or elsewhere unfortified among deceivers, for a meer Ornament, as some cruelly do.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. Remember how you dedicated them to Christ in Baptism, and what was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, and what renounced, and what you bound yourselves to do.</p>
            <p n="10">X. Remember still how much the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or misery of Church, and Kingdoms, and of the World, doth lie on the right or wrong educating of Youth by Parents; much more than our Universities or Schools.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. Remember that your own comfort or sorrow in them, lyeth most on your own duty or neglect; if they prove wicked and Plagues of the World, and you are the cause, it may tear your hearts, but what a joy is it to be the means of their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of their publick service in the World.</p>
            <p n="12">
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:45238:95"/>XII. Disgrace sin to them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend holiness by word and practice, and be your selves what you would have them be. And pray daily for them and your selves. The Lord bless this Counsel to them and you.</p>

            <p n="1">1. To be wiser than the Younger, as having longer time, and so to be their instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters in their several places.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And especially to deliver down to them the Sacred Scripture which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and the Memorials of Gods works, done for his Church in their dayes, and which they received from their Fathers.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:45238:95"/>3. And to go before them in the example of a holy and heavenly Life, <hi>Iob</hi> 32.4, <hi>and</hi> 8.8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.2.3. 1 <hi>Io.</hi> 2.13, 14. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Psal.</hi> 44.1. <hi>and</hi> 78.3, 5. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 21. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.26. <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.19. <hi>Ios.</hi> 4.6.21, 22. <hi>Ioel.</hi> 1.3.</p>
            <p n="2">§. 2. And nature and Scripture tell us that the <hi>Younger</hi> owe much Duty to the <hi>Elder</hi> sum'd up, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Ye Younger sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your selves to the Elder</hi>; this <hi>submission</hi> includeth especially, a reverence to their judgments, preferring them before their own, and supposing that ordinarily they are wiser than the younger, and therefore living towards their Elders in a humble Learning disposition, and not proudly setting their unfurnished wits against their greater expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience without very evident reason. For the understanding of which note.</p>
            <p n="3">§. 3. 1. That it is certain that meer Age doth not make men wise or good, none are more sottishly and uncurably ignorant than the aged ignorants; and few so bad as the old obstinate sinners. For they grow worse deceiving and being deceived, and more and more abuse Gods mercy, and are still going further from him, as the faithful are growing better and nearer to him.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="182" facs="tcp:45238:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>2. And it is certain that God greatly blesseth some young mens understandings, and maketh them wiser than the aged and their Teachers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And such a one is not bound to think that he knoweth not what he knoweth; nor to believe that every old man is wiser than he; all this we grant.</p>
            <p n="4">§. 4. But though, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 4.13, <hi>Better is a poor and a wise Child, than an old and foolish King who will no more be admonished.</hi> Yet,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is certain that knowledge cometh much by experience; and long experience and use, is farre more powerful than the short: And Time and Converse is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to it; naturally or ordinarily long learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and use increaseth knowledge. Do not all take it for granted that usually the boys who have been many years at School are better who Scholars than beginners; and so in all other acquisitions. Therefore it was the Elders that were commonly the Rulers of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Church and Commonwealth, and the Pastors and Rulers are thence called Elders: And if they were not ordinarily the wisest, why did not God make the <hi>Children</hi> the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Teachers and Rulers of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, but the Parents of the Children? Old men <hi>may</hi> be Ignorant and Erroneous
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:45238:96"/>
as well as wicked: but young men cannot be ripe in wisdom without a miracle; we are not therefore now to suppose unusual things to be usual. Ordinarily youth is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and raw; their conceptions undigest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not well fixed or improved: It is but <hi>few</hi> things that they know, and their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the rest, maketh them lyable to many Errours, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.11, 12. <hi>For the Time ye ought to have been Teachers,</hi> fitness to teach supposeth Time, the young cannot digest strong meats, A Novice must not be a Bishop, the reason may seem strange, <hi>Lest he be lift up with Pride, and fall into the condemnation of the Devil,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. <hi>One</hi> would think <hi>youth</hi> should be most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as conscious of defectiveness. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Ignorant</hi> know not <hi>that more</hi> is to be <hi>known</hi> than ever they attained, therefore they know not their own <hi>Ignorance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. And this <hi>PROVD IGNORANCE</hi> is so odious a sin, and the nurse of so many more, and so great an Enemy to wisdom and all good, that it is no wonder that it is the way to the condemnation of the Devil.</p>
            <p n="5">§. 5. Therefore though young men should not receive any Falshood, Heresie, or ill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample from the aged, yet they should still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:45238:97"/>
that <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> Age hath the great advantage for knowledge, and youth must needs live in an humble teachable sence of Ignorance; other, mens abuse of Time, and aged folly will not prove them miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously wise. The aged are alwaies the wisest if they equally improve their time and helps.</p>
            <p n="6">§. 6. It is so odious a sin for Lads and young Students to be self-conceited, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teachable; and set up their apprehensions with ungrounded confidence against their Elders, that all should be very fearful of that guilt, and have such humble thoughts of their own understandings, as to be jealous of their conceptions; for all these Vices make up their self-conceited prefidence.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is both great ignorance of the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of mens understanding, and great ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of themselves, to be ignorant that they are ignorant, and to think they are sure of that which they know not.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is an odious sort of <hi>Pride,</hi> to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value an ignorant understanding, and to be proudly confident of that which they have not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is folly to think that Truth can be known, without sufficient time and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; and contrary to the Worlds continual experience.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:45238:97"/>4. It is an absurd, an inhumane, a subvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the order of World, for Lads to set up their <hi>Wits</hi> by groundless self-conceitedness against their <hi>Elders,</hi> as for <hi>Subjects</hi> to set their <hi>Wills</hi> against <hi>Rulers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. It is a continual <hi>unrighteousness</hi>; there is a justice required in our common private judging, as well as in Judges publick judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And all should be heard and tryed before we peremptorily judge.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is a nest of continual <hi>Errour</hi> in the mind, which is the Souls deformity, and contrary to natures love of Truth.</p>
            <p n="7">§. 7. And it hath abundance of mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous effects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It keepeth out that Truth or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which should be received. It obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately resisteth necessary teaching, whereas the willingest entertainment is little enough to get true knowledge, even by slow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. As God giveth birds an instinct to feed their young, so the young ones by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct hunger, and open their mouths. But if they abhorr'd their meat and must be cram'd, they would commonly perish, that knowledge, that such get, must be from themselves, in their own <hi>thinking</hi> and <hi>obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> only: Where their minds are yet unfurnished with those Truths that must let in more, and daily objects will occasion
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:45238:98"/>
errour or confusion in their minds that are unprepared to improve them, and their own lusts will pervert them, and one errour draw in more, whereas the help of those that by long and successful Study, have rightly ordered and digested their concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, might be an exceeding help to willing Learners.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And such by Pride do forfeit the Grace of God, which he giveth to the humble, and resisteth the proud; and are oft given up to the self-conceitedness which they so defend, till their own Counsels and ways be their confusion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And the Devil hath advantage to set in, and even possesse such proud, prepared ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant minds, and become their Teacher, and lead them almost to what he will, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Truth, and the Church, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And self-conceit, and hasty confidence maketh them continual lyers; even while they rage for what they say as true: For being usually mistaken for want of patient tryal, they say what they think, and are not to be much believed in their prefidence.</p>
            <p n="8">§. 8. <hi>But seeing many old men are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and erroneous, and some young men have sounder understandings, how shall I know when I am guilty of proud, self-conceit, and prefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:45238:98"/>
and refusing others judgment. Answ.</hi> 1. When you rashly neglect their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Counsel, who have had as good helps and parts as you, and far longer time and experience, without so much as hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they have to say, and taking time to trye the cause according to its weight, especially if they be such as nature or rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion obliged you to learn of. 2. When you easilier suspect such than your own under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings. 3. When your confidence of your understandings is so unproportionable to your <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Studies,</hi> that you must suppose you know by a miracle or some rare capacity and wit; as if you had got more in a few years than the rest of mankind doth in many. 4. When you judge suddenly before you take time to think, and may know that you never heard what may be said against you.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When you talk most in a bold assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or a Teaching way, as if you were Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to be heard and reverenced, and not in a humble enquiring way, with that necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doubting which beseemeth Learners; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ye become as <hi>Little Children</hi> in teacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble humility, you are not fit for the School of Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.3. Even he that is a Teacher must be a Learner still; as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious of his remaining ignorance, and not think himself above it, nor set himself to
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:45238:99"/>
dispute against all that he understands not, but continue humbly to search and trie. 6. When those Reasons of your own seem good and cogent, which are sufficiently confuted, and you cannot see it, or which men of the most approved Learning &amp; fitness to judg do judg to be but folly; &amp; when other mens soundest reasons seem light to you, because you judg by a proud and selfish understanding, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and tenacious of all that is your own, and contemning that which is against you.</p>
            <p n="7">7. When you can too easily without cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain cogent reason dissent from the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not only of those whose Light and Integrity, hath by self-manifestation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced the World, but also from the <hi>genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of such as are commonly known to be the wise, godly and impartial; yea per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps from all the Church of Christ.</p>
            <p n="8">8. When the most and wisest men that know you, think you not so wise as you think your selves, nor your reason so good; but pity your self-conceitedness, and yet this brings you not to suspect and trie.</p>
            <p n="9">9. When you are hardly and rarely brought to an humble confession of your errours, but in all debates you seem still, what ever the cause be, to be in the right, and when you have once said it you will stand to it, and justifie untruths, or extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and excuse them.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:45238:99"/>10. When you too much affect the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem of wisdom, and love to have your judgments a Rule to others, and are unfit for true subjection.</p>
            <p>In a word when instead of being <hi>swift to hear, slow to speak, and slow to wrath,</hi> you are <hi>swift to speak and dictate, slow to hear and learn, and swift to wrathful censure of Dissenters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">§. 9. So common and hurtful is this sin in mankind, that you should still be duely fearful of it; Errour I fear taketh up the greater half of the thoughts of men, and most are rather deceived than in the right, and mans mind in flesh is in great darkness, and therefore <hi>PROVD IGNORANCE</hi> is a monstrous and pernicious vice; and most of the confusions and miseries of the World, of Kingdoms, Churches and all Societies come from it. Yea though it seems most contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Scepticism, it tendeth at last to Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity or Atheism. For when experience hath convinced such, that their most confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent rage, was but a mistake, they turn to think that there is nothing certain, and deny the greatest Truths. It is by this one sin of <hi>proud self-conceitedness in false thoughts,</hi> that Kingdoms, Churches and the World by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy seems remediless, and the wisest men that would cure them can do no good, but on themselves and few.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:45238:100"/>§. 10. But it is no where more unnatural than in Children against their Parents Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, and Scholars against their Tutors, and Ignorant persons, against the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the most able Godly Pastors. What an odious thing is it to see an ignorant Lad run against all his Fathers words, and think that he is wiser and always in the right; and to hear ignorant persons magisterially judge and despise their wise and faithful Teachers, before they are capable to understand them, or the matter of which they talk? Oh! how happily might Parents, and Pastors, and wise men promote knowledge and goodness in the world, were it not, for this selfish prefidence which shuts the door against their necessary helps.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XV. The Conclusion, to Ministers.</head>
            <p>THere is another sort of Helpers, on whom the wellfare of Youth much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends;
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:45238:100"/>
even the Ministers of Christ. But I presume not here to teach them: In my <hi>Reformed Pastor,</hi> I have spoken somewhat freely when I had leave. I cannot expect that those that silence me should hear me; nor will I think that able faithfull Ministers need my Counsell. But all that I will now say is, humbly to intreat those who take no great pains with the young persons in their Parishes, and will not be admonished by such as I, but to read <hi>Martin Bucer</hi> (who had so great a hand in counselling our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers that made the Liturgy) his Book <hi>de Regno Dei,</hi> his <hi>Censure of the Liturgy, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of Baptism, Confirmation, Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Discipline, and his vehement pressing the necessity of Congregational Discipline, and denying the Sacrament to the unmeet, and the necessity of keeping Baptized Youths among the</hi> Catechumens, <hi>till at age they come to true un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of the Covenant, which they made and must renew, and till they give credible signs of real Godlyness by a Godly Life, and of what mischievous effects it is to confirm them, and admit them to the Lords Supper, on their bare saying the words of the Catechism, the Creeds, Lords Prayer and Decalogue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out tryed Vnderstanding and serious Piety; And what a wrong it is to the Christian Church
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:45238:101"/>
and Religion, to confound and corrupt our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion for want of Parish Discipline and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions. And how little good all Canons or Laws for Reformation or Religious duty will do, if the Ministry be ignorant, worldly and ungodly, and the Churches be not taught and guided by able godly, humble, self-denying and loving Pastors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I beseech you read him diligently, he was no violent man, and his books here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned were purposely written for <hi>K.

His burnt bones were honourably vindicated by the publick praise, and his memory by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in <hi>Cambridge</hi> solemnly commended to posterity: I beseech you let his Counsel in these Books be revived, and true Reformation be tryed by their Light. I hope they will hear that great and moderate Reformer that will not hear me, or such as I. And if you will adde the Reading of old <hi>Salvian,</hi> and of <hi>Nic.
