            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THou hast here an

Is was not the <hi>Authors</hi>

of each particular circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.
Tis fit thou allow

him a liberty of conceit;
where thou takest to thy
self a liberty of judgment.
In substance, thou hast
here a new discovery of a
new <hi>World,</hi> which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
may finde little bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
entertainment in thy
opinion, than that of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus</hi>

the known <hi>World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That there shoud be <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipodes</hi>

gaze the Sun into spots, &amp;
descry mountaines in the

                  <p>IT is well enough
and sufficiently
known to all the
countries of <hi>Anda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luzia,</hi>
that I <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo
Gonsales</hi>
was born of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
parentage, and
that in the renowned City of <hi>Sivill,</hi>
to wit in the year 1552. my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
name being <hi>Therrando Gonsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>
(that was near kinsman by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
side unto <hi>Don Pedro Sanchez</hi>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:103664:5"/>
that worthy Count of <hi>Almenara,</hi>)
and as for my Mother, she was
the daughter of the Reverend and
famous Lawyer, <hi>Otho Perez de Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laveda,</hi>
Governour of <hi>Barcellona,</hi> and
<hi>Corrigidor of Biscaia:</hi> being the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
of 17 Children they had, I was
put to school, and intended by them
unto the Church. But our Lord pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
to use my service in matters of
far other nature and quality, inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me with spending some time in
the wars. It was at the time that
<hi>Don Fernando,</hi> the Noble and thrice
renowned Duke <hi>D Alva,</hi> was sent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Low Countries, <hi>viz.</hi> the year
of Grace 1568. I then following the
current of my foresaid desire, leaving
the Universitie of <hi>Salamanca,</hi> (whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my Parents had sent me) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
giving knowledge unto any of

<hi>France</hi> unto <hi>Antwerp,</hi> where in the

some 20. more, I bought me a little
Nagg, with which I travelled more
thriftily than young Gentlemen are
wont ordinarily to doo: Untill at last
arriving within a league of <hi>Antwerp,</hi>
certain of the cursed <hi>Ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ses</hi> set upon
me, and bereaved me of Horse, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and all: Whereupon I was fain
(through want and necessity,) to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into the service of Marshall <hi>Cossey</hi>
a French Noble man, whom I se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d
truely in honourable place, although
mine enemies gave it out to my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
that I was his horse-keepers
boy. But for that matter I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr
my self unto the report of the
Count <hi>Mansfield, Mounsieur Tavier,</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:103664:6"/>
and other men of known worth and
estimation; who have often testified
unto many of good credit, yet living,
the very truth in that behalf, which
indeed is this, that <hi>Mounsieur Cossey,</hi>
who about that time had been sent
Embassador unto the Duke <hi>D' Alva;</hi>
Governour of the Low Countries, he
I say understanding the Nobility of
my birth, and my late misfortune;
thinking it would be no small ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to him, to have a Spanyard of
that quality about him, furnished
me with horse, armour and whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
I wanted, using my service in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
so much (after once I had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the French tongue) as writing
his Letters, because my hand indeed
was then very fair. In the time of
War, if upon necessity, I now and
then dressed mine own Horse, it
ought not to be cast in my teeth, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
I hold it the part of a Gentleman,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103664:6"/>
for setting forward the service of his
Prince, to submit himself unto the
vilest office. The first expedition I
was in, was against the Prince of
<hi>Orange,</hi> at what time the Marshall my
friend aforesaid, met him making a
road into <hi>France,</hi> and putting him
to flight, chased him even unto the
walls of <hi>Cambray.</hi> It was my good
hap at that time to defeat a horseman
of the enemy, by killing his Horse
with my pistoll, which falling upon
his leg, so as he could not stir, he
yielded himself to my mercie; but
I knowing mine own weakness of
body, and seeing him a lusty tall fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
thought it my surest way to
dispatch him, which having done, I
rifled him of a chain, mony, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
things to the value of 200. du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cats:
no sooner was that money in
my purse, but I began to resume the
remembrance of my nobility, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103664:7"/>
giving unto <hi>Mounsieur Cossey</hi> the <hi>Besa
Los Manos,</hi> I got my self immediately
unto the Dukes court, where were
divers of my kindred, that (now they
saw my purse full of good Crowns)
were ready enough to take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of me; by their means I was
received into pay, and in process of
time obtained a good degree of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
with the Duke, who sometimes
would jeast a little more broadly at
my personage than I could well
brook. For although I must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
my stature to be so little, as no
man there is living, I think less, yet
in as much as it was the work of God,
and not mine, he ought not to have
made that a means to dishonour a
Gentleman withall. And those
things which have happened unto
me, may be an example, that great
and wonderfull things may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by most unlikely bodyes, if
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103664:7"/>
the mind be good, and the blessing
of our Lord do second and follow
the endeavours of the same. Well,
howsoever the Dukes merriments
went against my stomack, I framed
my self the best I could to dissemble
my discontent, and by such my pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
accommodating my self al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

some other his humors, so won his
favour, as at his departure home into
<hi>Spain,</hi> (whither I attended him)
the Year 1573. by his favour an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
some other accidents, (I will say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of my own industry, wherein
I was not wanting to my self) I was
able to carry home in my purse the
value of 30<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>0. Crowns. At my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
home my Parents, that were
marvellously displeased with my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture,
received me with great joy;
and the rather, for that they saw I
brought with me means to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
my self without their charge,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103664:8"/>
having a portion sufficient of mine
own, so that they needed not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falke
any thing from my bretheren or
sisters for my setting up. But fearing
I would spend it as lightly as I got
it, they did never leave importuning
me till I must needs marry the
daughter of a <hi>Portugais,</hi> a Merchant
of <hi>Lisbon,</hi> a man of great wealth and
dealings, called <hi>John Figueres.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I satisfied their desire, and putting

also a good part of mine own Stock
into the hands of my Father in Law,
or such as he wished me unto, I li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in good sort, even like a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
with great content for divers
years. At last it fell out, that some
disagreement happened between me
and one <hi>Pedro Delgades</hi> a Gentleman
of my kin, the causes whereof are
needless to be related, but so farr
this dissention grew between us,

fell out in the Year 1596. even
at that time that a certain great

constrained of necessity to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

being yet able to leave so much
more for the estate of my wife and

                  <p>On this blessed Island did they
set me a shore with a <hi>Negro</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
me, where, praised be God, I
recovered my health, and continued
there for the space of one whole
yeare, solacing my self (for lacke of
human societie) with Birds, and
brute beasts, as for <hi>Diego</hi> (so was
the <hi>Blackmoore</hi> called,) he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to live at the West end
of the Island in a Cave. Because
being alwayes together, victuals
would not have fallen out so plenty:
if the Hunting or Fowling of the
one had succeeded well, the other
would finde means to invite him,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103664:13"/>
but if it were scant with both, we
were faine both to bestirre our
selves; marry that fell out very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
for that no creatures there
doe any whit more fear a man,
then they do a <hi>Goate</hi> or a <hi>Cow;</hi> by
reason thereof I found means easily
to make tame divers sorts both of
<hi>Birds</hi> &amp; <hi>Beasts,</hi> which I did in short
time, onely by muzzeling them, so
as till they came either unto me,
or else <hi>Diego,</hi> they could not feed.
At first I took great pleasure in a
kinde of Partridges, of which I
made great use, as also of a tame
<hi>Fox</hi> I had. For whensoever I had
any occasion to conferre with <hi>Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go,</hi>
I would take me one of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hungry, and tying a note about
his neck, beat him from me, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
strait they would away to the
Cave of <hi>Diego,</hi> and if they found
him not there, still would they
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103664:14"/>
beat up and down all the West end
of the Island, till they had hunted
him out; yet this kinde of convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
not being without some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience,
needlesse here to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited;
after a certaine space I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
<hi>Diego</hi> (who though he were
a fellow of good parts, was ever
content to be ruled by me,) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
his habitation unto a promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
or cape upon the North-West
part of the Island, being, though a
league off, yet within sight of my
house and Chappell; and then, so
long as the weather was fair, we
could at all times by signalls, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
our minds each to other in
an instant, either by night, or by
day; which was a thing I took great
pleasure in.</p>
                  <p>If in the night season I would
signifie any thing to him, I used
to set up a light in the Tower or
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103664:14"/>
place where our bell hung: It is a
pretty large roome, having a faire
window well glased, and the walls
within being plaistered, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
white; by reason thereof,
though the light were but small, it
gave a great shew, as also it would
have done much further off, if need
had been. This light after I had let
stand some half houre, I used to
cover: and then if I saw any signall
of light againe from my compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
at the cape, I knew that he
waited for my notice, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving,
by hiding and shewing
my light, according to a certain
rule and agreement between us,
I certified him at pleasure what I
list: The like course I took in
the day to advertise him of my
pleasure, sometimes by smoake,
sometimes by dust, sometimes by a
more refined &amp; more effectual way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:103664:15"/>But this Art containeth more my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries
than are to be set down in
few words: Hereafter I will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
afford a discourse for it of
purpose, assuring my selfe that it
may prove exceedingly profitable
unto mankind, being rightly used
and well imployed: for that which
a messenger cannot perform in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
dayes, this may dispatch in a
peece of an houre. Well, I notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
after a while grew weary
of it, as being too painfull for me,
and betooke me again to my winged
messengers.</p>
                  <p>Upon the Sea-shore, especially
about the mouth of our River, I
found great store of a certain kinde
of wild Swan (before mentioned)
feeding almost altogether upon the
prey, and (that which is somewhat
strange,) partly of <hi>Fish,</hi> partly of
<hi>Birds,</hi> having (which is also no lesse
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103664:15"/>
strange) one foot with Clawes, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons,
and pounces, like an <hi>Eagle,</hi> and
the other whole like a <hi>Swan</hi> or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-fowl.
These birds using to breed
there in infinite numbers, I tooke
some 30. or 40. young ones of them,
and bred them up by hand, partly
for my recreation, partly also as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in my head some rudiments of
that device, which afterward I put
in practise. These being strong and
able to continue a great flight, I
taught them first to come at call
affar off, not using any noise but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the shew of a white Cloth. And
surely in them I found it true that
is delivered by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> how that
<hi>Animalia Carnivora,</hi> they are <hi>doci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liora
quam alterius cujusvis generis.</hi>
It were a wonder to tell what tricks
I had taught them, by that time
they were a quarter old; amongst
other things I used them by little
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103664:16"/>
and little to fly with burthens,
wherein I found them able above all
credit, and brought them to that
passe, as that a white sheet being
displayed unto them by <hi>Diego</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the side of a hill, they would car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
from me unto him, Bread, Flesh,
or any other thing I list to send, and
upon the like call return unto me
again.</p>
                  <p>Having prevailed thus farre, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to cast in my head how I might
doe to joyne a number of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
in bearing of some great bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then:
which if I could bring to passe,
I might enable a man to fly, and be
carried in the aire to some certain
place safe and without hurt. In this
cogitation having much laboured
my wits, and made some triall, I
found by experience, that if many
were put to the bearing of one great
burthen, by reason it was not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:103664:16"/>
all of them should rise together
just in one instant, the first that rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
himself upon his wings finding
himself stayed by a weight heavier
than he could move or stir, would
by and by give over, as also would
the second, third, and all the rest. I
devised (therefore) at last a means
how each of them might rise car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
but his own proportion of
weight only, and it was thus.</p>
                  <p>I fastned about every one of my
<hi>Gans' as</hi> a little pulley of Corke, and
putting a string through it of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
length, I fastened the one end
thereof unto a blocke almost of
eight Pound weight, unto the other
end of the string I tied a poyse
weighing some two Pound, which
being done, and causing the signall
to be erected, they presently rose
all (being 4 in number,) and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away my blocke unto the place
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:103664:17"/>
appointed. This falling out accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to my hope and desire. I made
proof afterwards, but using the help
of two or three birds more, in a
Lamb, whose happiness I much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied,
that he should be the first li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
creature to take possession of
such a device.</p>
                  <p>At last after divers tryalls I was
surprized with a great longing, to
cause my self to be carried in the
like sort, <hi>Diego</hi> my Moore was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
possessed with the same desire,
and but that otherwise I loved him
well, and had need of his help, I
should have taken that his ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
affection in very evill part:
for I hold it farre more honour to
have been the first flying man,
then to be another <hi>Neptune</hi> that first
adventured to sayle upon the Sea.
Howbeit not seeming to take notice
of the mark he aimed at, I only told
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:103664:17"/>
him (which also I take to be true)
that all my <hi>Gansa's</hi> were not of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
strength to carry him, being
a man, though of no great stature,
yet twice my weight at least. So
upon a time having provided all
things necessary, I placed my selfe
with all my trinckets, upon the top
of a rocke at the Rivers mouth, and
putting my self at full Sea upon an
Engine (the description whereof
ensueth) I caused <hi>Diego</hi> to advance
his Signall: whereupon my Birds
presently arose, 25. in number, and
carried me over lustily to the other
rocke on the other side, being about
a Quarter of a league.</p>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:103664:18"/>The reason why I chose that time
and place, was that I thought some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
might perchance fall out in
this enterprize contrary to my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
in which case I assured
my self the worst that could be,
was but to fall into the water, where
being able to swim well, I hoped
to receive little or no hurt in my fal.
But when I was once over in safety,
O how did my heart even swell with
joy and admiration of mine owne
invention! How often did I wish
my self in the midst of Spaine, that
speedily I might fill the world with
the fame of my glory and renown?
Every houre wished I with great
longing for the <hi>Indian</hi> Fleet to take
me home with them, but they stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
(by what mischance I do not
know) 3 Moneths beyond the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
time.</p>
                  <p>At last they came being in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:103664:19"/>
3 Carickes sore weather-beaten,
their people being for the most part
sick and exceeding weak, so as they
were constrained to refresh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in our Island one whole
moneth.</p>
                  <p>The Captaine of our Admirall
was called <hi>Alphonso de Xima,</hi> a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
man, wise, and desirous of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown,
and worthy better fortune
then afterward befell him. Unto
him I opened the device of my
<hi>Gansa's,</hi> well knowing how impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
it were otherwise to perswade
him to take in so many Birds into
the Ship, that would be more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
(for the nicenesse of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to be made for them,) then so
many men; Yet I adjured him by
all manner of Oaths, and perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
to afford me both true dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
and secrecy. Of the last I
doubted not much, as assuring my
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103664:19"/>
selfe, he would not dare to impart
the device to any other, before our
King were acquainted with it. Of
the first I feared much more, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
lest Ambition, and the desire
of drawing unto himself the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of such an invention, should
cause him to make me away; yet I
was forced to run the hazard, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
I would adventure the losse of
my Birds, the like whereof for my
purpose were not to be had in all
Christendome, nor any that I could
be sure, would ever serve the turne.
Well, that doubt in proofe fell out
to be causeless: the man I thinke
was honest of himself: but had
he dealt treacherously with me, I
had laid a plot for the discovery of
him, as he might easily judge I
would, which peradventure some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
moved him, yet God knowes
how he might have used me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103664:20"/>
my arrivall in Spain, if in the
meane course we had not been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted,
as you shall heare. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Thursday the 21. of <hi>June,</hi> to
wit in the yeare, 1599. we set
saile towards Spaine, I having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
me a very convenient Cabin
for my Birds, and stowage also for
mine Engine, which the Captaine
would have had me leave behinde
me, and it is a mervaile I had not,
but my good fortune therein saved
my life, and gave me that which
I esteeme more than an hundred
lives, if I had them: for thus it fell
out, after two moneths saile, we
encountred with a fleet of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
some ten leagues from the
Island of <hi>Tenerik,</hi> one of the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>
which is famous through the
World, for a Hill upon the same
called <hi>el Pico,</hi> that is to be discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and kenned upon the Sea, no
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103664:20"/>
less than 100. leagues off. We had
aboard us 5. times the number of
people that they had; we were well
provided of munition, and our men
in good health: yet seeing them
disposed to fight, and knowing what
infinite riches we carried with us,
we thought it a wiser way to fly, if
we might, than by encountring a
company of dangerous fellows, to
hazard not onely our own lives,
(which a man of valour in such a
case esteemeth not) but the estates
of many poor Merchants, who I
am afraid were utterly undone by
miscarriage of that business. Our
Fleet then consisted of 5. sail, to
wit, 3. Carracks, a Bark, and a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel,
that coming from the Isle of
Saint <hi>Thomas,</hi> had (in an evil hour
for him) overtaken us some few
dayes before.</p>
                  <p>The English had 3. Ships very
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:103664:21"/>
well appointed, and no sooner spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but they began to play for us,
and changing their course, as we
might well perceive, endeavoured
straightway to bring us under their
lee, which they might well do (as
the wind stood) especially being
light nimble vessels, and yare of
sail, as for the most part all the
<hi>English</hi> shipping is, whereas ours
was heavy, deep laden, foul with
the Sea: our Captain therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
peradventure wisely enough
(but I am sure neither valiantly,
not fortunately) to fly, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us to disperse our selves: the
Caravel by reason of too much hast
fell foul upon one of the Carracks,
and bruised her so, as one of the
<hi>English</hi> that had undertaken her, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
fetcht her up, and entred her: as
for the Caravel, she sank imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
in the sight of us all. The
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:103664:21"/>
Bark (for ought I could perceive)
no man making after her, escaped
unpursued; and another of our Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks
after some chase, was given
over by the <hi>English,</hi> that making
account to finde a booty good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
of us, and having us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and their third com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
made upon us with might
and main. Wherefore our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that was aboord us, gave di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
to runne aland upon the
Isle, the Port whereof we could not
recover, saying, that he hoped to
save some of the goods, and some
of our lives, and the rest he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
should be lost, than commit
all to the mercy of the Enemy.
When I heard of that resolution,
seeing the Sea to work high, and
knowing all the Coast to be full
of blind Rocks, and Shoals, so
as our Ves<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ell might not possibly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:103664:22"/>
come near land, before it must
needs be rent in a thousand pieces,
I went unto the Captain, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him the desperateness of the
course he intended, wishing him
rather to try the mercy of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy,
than so to cast away him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and so many brave men: but
he would not hear me by any
means; whereupon discerning it to
be high time to shift for my self,
first, I sought out my Box or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Casket of stones, and having
put it into my sleeve, I then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
me to my <hi>Gansa's,</hi> put them
upon my Engine, and my self
upon it, trusting (as indeed it
happily fell out) that when the
Ship should split, my Birds, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they wanted their Signal,
of themselves, and for safeguard of
their own lives (which nature hath
taught every living creature to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103664:22"/>
to their power) would make
towards the Land; which fell out
well (I thank God,) according
to mine expectation. The people
of our Ship marvelled about what I
went, none of them being acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with the use of my Birds, but
the Captain, for <hi>Diego</hi> was in the
<hi>Rosaria,</hi> the Ship that fled away
unpursued, (as before I told you:)
some half a league we were from
the Land, when our Carrack struck
upon a Rock, and split immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
whereupon I let loose unto my
Birds the reins, having first placed
my self upon the highest of the
Deck: and with the shock they all
arose, carrying me fortunately unto
the Land, whereof, whether I were
well apaid, you need not doubt:
but a pitifull sight it was unto
me, to behold my friends and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
in that miserable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103664:23"/>
of whom (notwithstanding)
many escaped better than they had
any reason to hope for. For the
<hi>English</hi> launching out their Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boats,
like men of more noble,
and generous disposition than we
are pleased to esteem them, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
compassion upon them, used
all the diligence they could to help
such as had any means to save
themselves from the fury of the
waves, and that even with their
own danger: amongst many, they
took up our Captain, who (as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Pacio</hi> could since tell me) having
put himself into his Cock, with
12. others, was induced to yield
himself unto one Captain <hi>Rymun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi>
who carried him together
with our Pilot along in their voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
with them, being bound for
the <hi>East Indies;</hi> but their hard hap
was by a breach of the Sea near
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103664:23"/>
the Cape of <hi>Buona Esperanca,</hi> to be
swallowed of the merciless Waves,
whose fury a little before they had
so hardly escaped. The rest of them
(as I likewise heard) and they were
in all some 26. persons that they
took into their ship, they set them
aland soon after at <hi>Cape Verde.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for my self, being now ashore
in a Country inhabited for the most
part by <hi>Spaniards,</hi> I reckoned my
self in safety. Howbeit I quickly
found the Reckoning, I so made,
mine Host had not been acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
withall; for it was my chance
to pitch upon that part of the Isle,
where the Hill before mentioned
beginneth to rise. And it is inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
by a Savage kinde of people,
that live upon the sides of that Hill,
the top whereof is alwayes covered
with Snow, and held for the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous
height and steepness not to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:103664:24"/>
be accessible either for man or
beast. Howbeit these Savages fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> between whom
and them there is a kinde of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
war) hold themselves as near
the top of that hill as they can,
where they have divers places of
good strength, never coming down
into the fruitfull Valleys, but to
prey upon what they can find there.
It was the chance of a company
of them to espy me within some
hours space after my Landing:
They thinking they had light upon
a booty, made towards me with all
the speed they could, but not so pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
as that I could not perceive
their purpose before they came near
to me by half a quarter of a league;
seeing them come down the side
of a Hill with great speed directly
towards me, divers of them carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
long Staves, besides other wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:103664:24"/>
which, because of their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
from me, I might not discern.
I thought it high time to bestir me,
and shift for my self, and by all
means to keep my self out of the
fingers of such slaves, who had they
caught me, for the hatred they bear
to us <hi>Spaniards,</hi> had surely hewed
me all to pieces.</p>
                  <p>The Country in that place was
bare, without the coverture of any
wood: But the mountain before
spoken of, beginning even there to
lift up it self, I espied in the side
of the same a white cliff, which I
trusted my <hi>Gansa's</hi> would take for
a signal, and being put off; would
make all that way, whereby I might
quickly be carried so far, as those
barbarous Cullions should not be
able to overtake me, before I had
recovered the dwelling of some <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi>
or at least-wise might have
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103664:25"/>
time to hide my self from them,
till that in the night, by help of
the stars, I might guide my self
toward <hi>Las Loeguna,</hi> the City of
that Island, which was about one
league off, as I think. Wherefore
with all the celerity that might be,
I put my self upon mine Engine,
and let loose the reins unto my
<hi>Gansa's;</hi> It was my good fortune
that they took all one way, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
not just that way I aimed at.
But what then? O Reader, <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge
aures,</hi> prepare thy self unto the
hearing of the strangest Chance
that ever happened to any mortal
man, and that I know thou wilt not
have the Grace to believe, till thou
feest it seconded with Iteration of
Experiments in the like, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a one, I trust, thou mayst in short
time; My <hi>Gansa's,</hi> like so many
horses that had gotten the bit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103664:25"/>
their teeth, made (I say) not
towards the Cliff I aimed at, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
I used my wonted means to
direct the Leader of the Flock that
way, but with might and main
took up towards the top of <hi>El Pico,</hi>
and did never stay till they came
there, a place where they say never
man came before, being in all esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
at least 15 leagues in height
perpendicularly upward, above the
ordinary level of the Land and Sea.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:103664:26"/>
                     <figure/>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:103664:26"/>What manner of place I found
there, I should gladly relate unto
you, but that I make haste to matters
of far greater Importance. There
when I was set down, I saw my
poor <hi>Gansa's</hi> fall to panting and
blowing gaping forbreath, as if they
would all presently have died: where
fore I thought it not good to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
them a while, forbearing to draw
them in, (which they never wont to
endure without strugling) and little
expecting that which followed.</p>
                  <p>It was now the season that these
Birds were wont to take their flight
away, as our Cuckoes and Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
do in <hi>Spain,</hi> towards the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn.
They (as after I perceived)
mindfull of their usual voyage,
even as I began to settle my self
for the taking of them in, as it
were with one consent, rose up, and
having no other place higher to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103664:27"/>
make toward, to my unspeakable
fear and amazement strook bolt
upright, and never did lin tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
upward, and still upward,
for the space, as I might guess, of
one whole hour; toward the end of
which time, methought I might
perceive them to labour less and
less; till at length, O incredible
thing! they forbare moving anything
at all and yet remained unmoveable
as stedfastly, as if they had been
upon so many perches, the Lines
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>cked; neither I, nor the Engine
moved at all, but abode still, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no manner of weight.</p>
                  <p>I found then by this Experience
that which no Philosopher ever
dreamed of, to wit, that those things
which we call heavy, do not sink
towards the Center of the Earth,
as their natural place, but as drawn
by a secret property of the Globe of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103664:27"/>
the Earth, or rather some thing
within the same, in like sort as the
Load-stone draweth Iron, being
within the compass of the beams
attractive.</p>
                  <p>For though it be true that there
they could abide unmoved without
the prop or sustentation of any
corporal thing, other than the air,
as easily and quietly as a fish in the
middle of the water, yet forcing
themselves never so little, it is not
possible to imagine with what swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and celerity they were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
and whether it were upward,
downward, or sidelong, all was one.
Truly I must confess, the horrour
and amazement of that place was
such, as if I had not been armed
with a true <hi>Spanish</hi> courage and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,
I must needs have dyed
there with very fear.</p>
                  <p>But the next thing that did most
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:103664:28"/>
trouble me, was the swiftness of
Motion, such as did even almost
stop my breath; If I should liken it
to an Arrow out of a Bow, or to a
stone cast down from the top of
some high tower, it would come far
short, and short.</p>
                  <p>Another thing there was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and more than exceeding, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome
unto me, and that was the
Illusions of Devils and wicked spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
who, the first day of my arrival,
came about me in great numbers,
carrying the shapes and likeness of
men and women, wondring at me
like so many Birds about an Owl,
and speaking divers kindes of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages
which I understood not, till
at last I did light upon them that
spake very good <hi>Spanish,</hi> some
<hi>Dutch,</hi> and other some <hi>Italian,</hi> for
all these Languages I understood.</p>
                  <p>And here I saw onely a touch of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:103664:28"/>
the Suns absence for a little while
once, ever after having him in my
sight. Now to yeeld you satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the other, you shall understand
that my <hi>Gansa's,</hi> although entangled
in my line, might easily find means
to seize upon divers kinds of <hi>Fly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s</hi>
and <hi>Birds,</hi> as especially <hi>Swallows,</hi>
and <hi>Cuckoes,</hi> whereof there were
multitudes, as Motes in the Sunne;
although, to say the truth, I never
saw them to feed any thing at all.
As for my self, in truth I was much
beholding unto those same, whether
men or Devils I know not, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
divers speeches, which I
will forbeare awhile to relate, told
me, that if I would follow their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
I should not onely be
brought safely to my home, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
be assured to have the command
of all pleasures of that place, at all
times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:103664:29"/>
To the which motions not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to make a flat deniall, I pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a time to think of it, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
intreated them (though I felt no
hunger at all, which may seeme
strange) to help me with some
victualls, least in the meane while
I should starve. They did so readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enough, and brought mee very
good Flesh, and Fish of divers sorts
well dressed, but that it was excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
fresh, and without any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of relish of salt.</p>
                  <p>Wine also I tasted there of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
sorts, as good as any in <hi>Spain,</hi>
and Beere, no better in all <hi>Antwerp.</hi>
They wished me then, while I had
meanes to make my provision, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
me, that till the next Thursday
they could not help me to any
more, if happily then; at what time
also they would find means to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
me back, and set me safe in
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103664:29"/>
                     <hi>Spain,</hi> where I would wish to be, so
that I would become one of their
fraternity, and enter into such cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
and profession as they had
made to their Master and Captain,
whom they would not name. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
them gently for the time,
telling them, I saw little reason
to be very glad of such an offer,
praying them to be mindfull of me
as occasion served.</p>
                  <p>So for that time I was rid of
them, having first furnished my
Pockets with as much Victuall as I
could thrust in, amongst the which I
fail not to afford place for a little
Botijo of good Canary wine.</p>
                  <p>Now shall I declare unto you the
quality of the place, in which I then
was. The Clouds I perceived to be
all under me, between me and the
earth. The starrs, by reason it was
always day, I saw at all times alike,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:103664:30"/>
not shining bright, as upon the earth
we are wont to see them in the
night time; but of a whitish co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
like that of the Moon in the
day time with us: And such of
them as were to be seen (which were
not many) shewed farre greater
than with us, yea (as I should ghess)
no lesse than ten times so great. As
for the Moon being then within
two dayes of the change, she ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
of a huge and fearfull quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie.</p>
                  <p>This also is not to be forgotten,
that no starrs appeared but on that
part of the Hemispheare that was
next the Moon, and the neerer to
her the bigger in Quantity they
shewed. Again I must tell you, that
whether I lay quiet and rested, or
else were carried in the Aire, I
perceived my self still to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
directly between the Moon
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103664:30"/>
and the earth. Whereby it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
not only that my <hi>Gansa's</hi> took
none other way than directly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the Moon, but also, that when
we rested (as at first we did for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
houres,) either we were insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
carried, (for I perceived no such
motion) round about the Globe of
the Earth, or else that (according to
the late opinion of <hi>Copernicus,</hi>) the
Earth is carryed about, and turneth
round perpetually, from <hi>West</hi> to
the <hi>East,</hi> leaving unto the Planets
onely that motion which Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
call naturall, and is not upon
the Poles of the Equinoctiall, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
termed the Poles of the
World, but upon those of the Zodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ake;
concerning which question, I
will speake more hereafter, when I
shall have leysure to call to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance
the <hi>Astronomy</hi> that I lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
being a young man at <hi>Salaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:103664:31"/>
but have now almost forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
                  <p>The aire in that place I found
quiet without any motion of wind,
and exceeding temperate, neither
hot nor cold, as where neither the
Sun-beames had any subject to
reflect upon, neither was yet ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the earth or water so neer as
to affect the aire with their naturall
quality of coldnesse. As for that
imagination of the Philosophers,
attributing heat together with
moistnesse unto the ayre, I never
esteemed it otherwise than a fancy.
Lastly now it is to be remembred
that after my departure from the
earth, I never felt any appetite of
hunger or thirst. Whether the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Aire, our proper element
not being infected with any Vapors
of the earth and water, might yeeld
nature sufficient nutriment; or what
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103664:31"/>
else might be the cause of it, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell, but so I found it, although I
perceived my self in perfect health
of body, having the use of all my
Limbs and Senses; and Strength
both of Body and Minde, rather
beyond and above, than any thing
short of the pitch, or wonted vigor.
Now let us go on: and on we shall
go more than apace.</p>
                  <p>Not many houres after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
of that develish companie
from me, my <hi>Gansa's</hi> began to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stir
themselves, still directing their
course toward the globe or body of
the Moon, and they made their way
with that incredible swiftness, as
I think they gained not so little as
fifty Leagues in every hour. In
that passage I noted three things
very remarkeable, one, that the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we went, the lesser the globe of
the Earth appeared to us; whereas
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103664:32"/>
still on the contrary side the Moon
shewed her self more &amp; more mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strously
huge.</p>
                  <p>Again, the Earth (which ever I
held in mine eye) did as it were
mask it self with a kind of bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
like another Moon; and even
as in the Moon we discerned cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
spots or Clouds, as it were,
so did I then in the earth. But
whereas the forme of those spots in
the Moon continue constantly one
&amp; the same; these by little &amp; little
did change every hour. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
thereof I conceive to be this,
that whereas the Earth, according to
her naturall motion, (for that such
a motion she hath, I am now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to joyne in opinion with
<hi>Copernicus,</hi>) turneth round upon her
own Axe every 24. houres from the
<hi>West</hi> unto the <hi>East:</hi> I should at the
first see in the middle of the body
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103664:32"/>
of this new starre a spot like unto a
Peare that had a morsell bitten out
upon the one side of him; after cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
houres, I should see that spot
slide away to the <hi>East</hi> side. This
no doubt was the maine of <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fricke.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then should I perceive a great
shining brightnesse to occupy that
roome, during the like time (which
(was undoubtedly none other than
the great <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean). After
that succeeded a spot almost of an
Ovall form, even just such as we see
<hi>America</hi> to have in our Mapps. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
another vast cleerness representing
the <hi>West Ocean;</hi> and lastly a medly of
spots, like the Countries of <hi>East
Indies.</hi> So that it seemed unto me
no other than a huge Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
Globe, leasurely turned before
me, wherein successively, all the
Countries of our earthly world
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:103664:33"/>
within the compasse of 24. hours
were represented to my sight. And
this was all the meanes I had now to
number the dayes, and take recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philosophers</hi> and <hi>Mathematicians</hi>
I would should now confesse the
wilfulnesse of their own blindnesse.
They have made the world believe
hitherto, that the Earth hath no
motion. And to make that good,
they are fain to attribute unto all
and every of the celestiall bodies
two motions, quite contrary each to
other; whereof one is from the <hi>East</hi>
to the <hi>West,</hi> to be performed in 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.
hours; (that they imagine to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
<hi>per raptum primi Mobilis</hi>) the
other from the <hi>West</hi> to the <hi>East</hi> in
severall proportions.</p>
                  <p>O incredible thing, that those
same huge bodies of the fixed stars
in the highest orbe, whereof divers
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103664:33"/>
are by themselves confessed to be
more than one hundreth times as
bigge as the whole earth, should as
so many nailes in a Cart-Wheele,
be whirled about in that short space,
whereas it is many thousands of
Years (no lesse, I trow, they say,
than 30 thousand) before that orbe
do finish his Course from <hi>West</hi> to
<hi>East,</hi> which they call the naturall
motion. Now whereas to every of
these they yeeld their natural course
from <hi>West</hi> to <hi>East;</hi> therein they doe
well. The <hi>Moone</hi> performeth it in 27.
dayes; the <hi>Sun, Venus,</hi> and <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
in a Years or thereabouts, <hi>Mars</hi>
in three Yeare, <hi>Jupiter</hi> in twelve
Years, and <hi>Saturne</hi> in 30 But to
attribute unto these celestiall bodies
contrary motions at once, was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
absurd conceit &amp; much more, to
imagine that same Orbe, wherein the
fixed stars are, (whose natural course
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103664:34"/>
taketh so many thousand of years)
should every 24. houres be turned
about. I will not go so far as <hi>Coper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicus,</hi>
that maketh the Sunne the
Center of the Earth, and unmovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
neither will I define any thing
one way or other. Only this I say,
allow the Earth his motion (which
these eyes of mine can testifie to be
his due) and these absurdities are
quite taken away, every one ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his single and proper Motion
onely.</p>
                  <p>But where am I? At the first I
promised an History, and I fall into
disputes before I am aware. There
is yet one accident more befell me
worthy of especiall remembrance:
that during the time of my stay, I
saw as it were a kind of cloud of
a reddish colour growing toward
me, which continually growing nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
and neerer, at last I perceived to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:103664:34"/>
be nothing else but a huge swarme
of Locusts.</p>
                  <p>He that readeth the discourses of
learned men, concerning them, and
namely that of <hi>John Leo,</hi> in his
description of <hi>Affrike,</hi> how that
they are seen in the Aire many days
before they fall upon a countrey,
adding unto that which they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
this experience of mine, will
easily conclude, that they cannot
come from any other place than the
Globe of the Moon. But give me
leave now at last to passe on my
journey quietly, without interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for Eleven or Twelve dayes,
during all which time, I was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
directly toward the Globe or
body of the Moon with such a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
whirling as cannot be expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
                  <p>For I cannot imagine that a bullet
out of the mouth of a Canon could
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:103664:35"/>
make way through the vaporous &amp;
muddy aire near the earth with that
celerity, which is most strange, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that my <hi>Gansa's</hi> moved their
wings but even now and then, and
sometimes not at all in a Quarter of
an houre together; onely they held
them stretched out, so passing on, as
we see that <hi>Eagles,</hi> and <hi>Kites</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
will do for a little space, when
(as one speaks, I remember) <hi>cuncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundo
volatu pene eodem loco pendu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la
circumtuentur;</hi> and during the
time of those pauses I believe they
tooke their napps and times of slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping;
for other (as I might easily
note) they had none.</p>
                  <p>Now for my self, I was so fast
knit unto my Engin, as I durst
commit my selfe to slumbring e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to serve my turne, which I
took with as great ease (although
I am loath to speake it, because it
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:103664:35"/>
may seeme incredible) as if I had
been in the best Bed of down in all
<hi>Antwerp.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After Eleven dayes passage in
this violent flight, I perceived that
we began to approach neere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another Earth, if I may so call
it, being the Globe or very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of that Starre which we call the
Moon.</p>
                  <p>The first difference that I found
between it and our earth, was, that
it shewed it self in his naturall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours:
ever after I was free from
the attraction of the Earth, whereas
with us, a thing removed from our
eye but a league or two, begins to
put on that lurid aud deadly colour
of blue.</p>
                  <p>Then, I perceived also, that it
was covered for the most part with
a huge and mighty Sea, those parts
only being drie Land, which shew
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:103664:36"/>
unto us here somewhat darker than
the rest of her body (that I mean)
which the Country people call <hi>el
hombre della Luna,</hi> the Man of the
Moon.</p>
                  <p>As for that part which shineth so
cleerly in our eyes; it is even ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Ocean, yet besprinckled here
and there with <hi>Islands,</hi> which for the
littleness, so far off we cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</p>
                  <p>So that same splendor appearing
unto us, and giving light unto our
night, appeareth to be nothing else
but the reflection of the Sun-beams
returned unto us out of the water, as
out of a glasse: How ill this agreeth
with that which our <hi>Philosophers</hi>
teach in the Schooles I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.</p>
                  <p>But alas how many of their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
hath time and experience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
in this our age, with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citall
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103664:36"/>
whereof I will not stand to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the Reader.</p>
                  <p>Amongst many other of their
vain surmises, the time and order
of my narration putteth me in mind
of one, which now my experience
found most untrue.</p>
                  <p>Who is there that hath not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
believed the uppermost Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
of the Ayre to be extreme
hot, as being next forsooth unto
the naturall place of the Element of
Fire.</p>
                  <p>O Vanities, fansies, Dreames!</p>
                  <p>After the time I was once quite
free from the attractive Beames of
that tyrannous Loadstone, the earth,
I found the Ayre of one and the
self same temper, without Winds,
without Raine, without Mists, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Clouds, neither hot not cold,
but continually after one and the
same tenor, most pleasant, milde,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:103664:37"/>
and comfortable, till my arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall
in that New World of the
Moon.</p>
                  <p>As for that Region of Fire our
<hi>Philosophers</hi> talke of, I heard no
news of it; mine eyes have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
informed me there can be
no such thing.</p>
                  <p>The Earth by turning about had
now shewed me all her parts twelve
times when I finished my course:
For when by my reckoning it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be (as indeed it was) Tuesday
the Eleventh day of <hi>September,</hi> (at
what time the Moon being two
dayes old was in the Twentieth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of <hi>Libra,</hi>) my <hi>Gansa's</hi> stayed
their course as it were with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and tooke their rest, for
certain houres; after which they
took their flight, and within lesse
than one houre, set me upon the
top of a very high hill in that other
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103664:37"/>
world, where immediatly were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
unto mine eyes many most
strange and unwonted fights.</p>
                  <p>For first, I observed, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Globe of the Earth
shewed much bigger there than the
Moon doth unto us, even to the full
trebling of her diameter, yet all
manner of things there were of
largeness and quantity, 10. 20. I
thinke I may say 30. times more
than ours.</p>
                  <p>Their trees at least three times
so high as ours, and more than five
times the breadth and thicknesse.</p>
                  <p>So their herbs, Beasts, and Birds;
although to compare them with
ours, I know not well how, because
I found not any thing there, any
<hi>Species</hi> either of <hi>Beast</hi> or <hi>Bird</hi> that
resembled ours any thing at all, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<hi>Swallows, Nightingales, Cuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koes,
Woodcocks, Batts,</hi> &amp; some kinds
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:103664:38"/>
of wild <hi>Fowl,</hi> as also of such <hi>Birds</hi>
as my <hi>Gansa's,</hi> all which, (as now I
well perceived,) spend the time of
their absence from us, even there in
that world; neither do they vary
any thing at all either in quantity
or quality from those of ours here,
as being none other than the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
same, and that not onely <hi>Specie,</hi>
but <hi>numero.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But of these novelties, more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after
in their due places.</p>
                  <p>No sooner was I set down upon
the ground, But I was surprised
with a most ravenous hunger, and
earnest desire of eating. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
stepping unto the next tree, I
fastened thereunto my engine, with
my <hi>Gansa</hi>'s, and in great haste fell
to searching of my pockets for the
Victuals I had reserved as aforesaid:
but to my great amazement and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfort,
I found in stead of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge,</hi>
                     <pb n="69" facs="tcp:103664:38"/>
and <hi>Capon,</hi> which I thought
to have put there, a mingle mangle
of dry leaves, of <hi>Goats haire, sheepe,</hi>
or <hi>Goats-dung, Mosse,</hi> and such like
trash.</p>
                  <p>As for my <hi>Canary Wine,</hi> it was
turned to a stinking and filthie kind
of liquor, like the Urine of some
<hi>Beast.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O the illusions of wicked spirits,
whose helpe if I had been faine on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to rely upon, you see how I had
been served.</p>
                  <p>Now while I stood musing and
wondring at this strange <hi>Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosis,</hi>
I heard my <hi>Gansa's</hi> upon the
sudden to make a great fluttering
behind me. And looking back, I
espied them to fall greedily upon a
certain shrub within the compasse
of their lines, whose leaves they fed
upon most earnestly; where hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I had never seene them to eat
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103664:39"/>
any manner of green meate whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.
Whereupon stepping to the
shrubb, I put a lease of it between
my teeth: I cannot express the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
I found in the tast thereof; such
it was I am sure, as if I had not with
great discretion moderated my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite,
I had surely surfetted upon
the same.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time it fell out to be
a baite that well contented both my
<hi>Birds</hi> and me at that time, when we
had need of some good refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Scarcely had I ended this ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quett,
when upon the sudden I saw
my self environed with a kind of
people most strange, both for their
feature, demeanure, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell.</p>
                  <p>Their stature was most divers,
but for the most part, twice the
height of ours; their colour and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103664:39"/>
countenance most pleasing, and
their habit such, as I know not how
to express.</p>
                  <p>For neither did I see any kind of
<hi>Cloth, Silke,</hi> or other stuffe to resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the matter of that whereof their
Clothes were made; neither (which
is most strange of all other) can I
devise how to describe the colour
of them, being in a manner all clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed alike.</p>
                  <p>It was neither blacke, nor white,
yellow nor redd, greene nor
blue, nor any colour composed of
these.</p>
                  <p>But if you aske me what it was,
then I must tell you, it was a colour
never seen in our earthly world, and
therefore neither to be described
unto us by any, nor to be conceived
of one that never saw it.</p>
                  <p>For as it were a hard matter to
describe unto a man borne blind
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:103664:40"/>
the difference betweene blue and
Greene, so can I not bethinke my
selfe of any meanes how to deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
unto you this <hi>Lunar</hi> colour,
having no affinitie with any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that ever I beheld with mine
eyes.</p>
                  <p>Onely this I can say of it, that
it was the most glorious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull,
that can possibly be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined;
neither in truth was there
any one thing, that more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me, during my abode in that
new world, than the beholding of
that most pleasing and resplendent
colour.</p>
                  <p>It remaineth now that I speake
of the Demeanure of this people,
who presenting themselves unto
me upon the sudden, and that
in such extraordinary fashion as
I have declared, being strucken
with a great amasement, I crossed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:103664:40"/>
my self, and cried out, <hi>Jesus Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No sooner was the word <hi>Jesus</hi>
out of my mouth, but young &amp; old,
fell all down upon their knees, (at
which I not a little rejoyced) hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up both their hands on high,
and repeating all certain words
which I understood not.</p>
                  <p>Then presently they all arising,
one that was far the tallest of them
came unto me, and embraced me,
with great kindnesse, and giving
order (as I partly perceived) unto
some of the rest to stay by my <hi>Birds,</hi>
he took me by the hand, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
me down toward the foote of
the hill, brought me to his dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
being more than half a league
from the place where I first aligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>It was such a building for beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and hugeness, as all our world
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103664:41"/>
cannot shew any neere comparable
to it.</p>
                  <p>Yet such I saw afterwards else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,
as this might seem but a Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
in respect of them.</p>
                  <p>There was not a doore about the
house, that was not 30. foot high,
and twelve in breadth.</p>
                  <p>The roomes were between 40.
and 50. foote in height, and so all
other proportions answerable.</p>
                  <p>Neither could they well be much
lesse, the Master inhabiting them,
being full 28. high.</p>
                  <p>As for his corporature, I suppose
verily that if we had him here in
this world to be weighed in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,
the poyse of his body would
shew it self more ponderous than
Five and Twenty, peradventure
thirty of ours.</p>
                  <p>After I had rested my self with
him the value of one of our dayes;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:103664:41"/>
he ledd me some Five leagues off,
unto the <hi>Palace</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi> of the
Countrey.</p>
                  <p>The stateliness of the building
wherof I wil leave unto the second
part of this work, as also many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
particulars, which will mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
more pleasure to the Reader,
than yet I may afford him, being
desirous in this first part to set down
no more than what the processe of
my story concerning my Journey
doth necessarily draw from me.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Prince</hi> whose stature was
much higher than the former, is
called (as neere as I can by Letters
declare it, for their sounds are not
perfectly to be expressed by our
characters) <hi>Pylonas,</hi> which signifieth
in their Language, <hi>First<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> perhaps
it be not rather a denotation of his
dignity and authority, as being the
prime Man in all those parts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:103664:42"/>In all those parts, I say. For
there is one supreme <hi>Monarch</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, of stature yet much
more huge than he, commanding
over all that whole <hi>Orbe</hi> of that
world, having under him 29 other
Princes of exceeding great power,
and every of them 24 others, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
this <hi>Pylonas</hi> was one.</p>
                  <p>The first ancestor of this great
<hi>Monarch</hi> came out of the earth (as
they deliver) and by marriage with
the inheretrix of that huge Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
obtaining the government,
left it unto his posteritie, who ever
since have held the same, even for
the space of 40 thousand dayes or
<hi>Moons,</hi> which amounteth unto 3077
Years.</p>
                  <p>And his name being <hi>Irdonozur,</hi>
his heirs, unto this day, do all as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
unto themselves that name,
he, they say, having continued there
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:103664:42"/>
well neer 400 <hi>Moons,</hi> and having
begotten divers children, returned
(by what means they declare not)
unto the Earth againe: I doubt not
but they may have their Fables, as
well as we.</p>
                  <p>And because our Histories afford
no mention of any earthly man to
have ever been in that world before
my self, and much lesse to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
thence again, I cannot but
condemne that tradition for false
and fabulous; yet this I must tell
you, that learning seemeth to be in
great estimation among them: And
that they make semblance of detest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all Lying and Falshood, which
is wont there to be severely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</p>
                  <p>Again, which may yeeld some

to wit even unto the age as they
professed to me of 30000. <hi>Moons,</hi>
which amounteth unto 1000. Years
and upwards, (so that the ages of
3. or 4. men might well reach unto
the time of the first <hi>Irdonozur,</hi>) and
this is noted generally, that the tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
people are of Stature, the more
excellent they are for all indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of mind, and the longer time
they do live.</p>
                  <p>For whereas (that which before

such seldom live above the age of a

to 80. of our Years, and they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

bastard-men, counterfeits, or
Changelings; so those whom they
account Genuine, naturall, and true
<hi>Lunars,</hi> both in quantitie of bodie,
and length of life, they have for
the most part 30. times as much as
we, which proportion agreeth well
with the quantity of the day in both
worlds, theirs containing almost 30
of ours.</p>
                  <p>Now when I shall declare unto
you the manner of our travell unto
the Palace of <hi>Pylonas,</hi> you will say
you scarce ever heard any thing
more strange and incredible.</p>
                  <p>Unto every one of us there was
delivered at our first setting forth,
two Fans of <hi>Feathers,</hi> not much
unlike to those that our Ladies do
carrie in <hi>Spaine,</hi> to make a coole
Aire unto themselves in the heat of
<hi>Summer.</hi> The use of which Fans
before I declare unto you, I must let
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:103664:45"/>
you understand that the <hi>Globe</hi> of the
<hi>Moon</hi> is not altogether destitute of
an attractive Power: but it is so
farre weaker than that of the earth,
as if a man do but spring upward,
with all his force, (as Dancers do
when they shew their activity by ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering)
he shall be able to mount
50. or 60. foot high, and then
he is quite beyond all attraction of
the <hi>Moons</hi> earth, falling down no
more, so as by the help of these
Fans, as with wings, they convey
themselves in the Aire in a short
space (although not with that swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
that Birds do) even whither
they lift.</p>
                  <p>In two houres space (as I could
guesse) by the helpe of these fans,
we were carried through the Aire
those five Leagues, being about
60 persons. Being arrived at the
Palace of <hi>Pylonas,</hi> after our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

had gotten audience, (which
was not presently) and had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
what manner of present he had
brought; I was immediately called
in unto him by his attendants: by
the statelinesse of his Palace, and the
reverence done unto him, I soone
discerned his greatnesse, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
framed my selfe to win his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the best I might. You may
remember I told you of a certain
little Box or Casket of Jewels, the
remainder of those which being
brought out of the <hi>East Indies,</hi>
I sent from the Ile of St. <hi>Hellen</hi> into
<hi>Spaine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These, before I was carried in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, I took out of my pocket in a
corner, and making choice of some
of every sort, made them ready
to be presented as I should think
fit.</p>
                  <p>I found him sitting in a most
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:103664:46"/>
magnificent chaire of Estate, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
his Wife or Queen upon one
hand, and his eldest Son on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which were both attended, the
one by a troope of Ladies, and the
other of young men, and all along
the side of the roome stood a great
number of goodly personages,
whereof scarce any one was lower
of stature than <hi>Pylonas,</hi> whose age
they say is now 21000. <hi>Moons.</hi>
At my first entrance, falling downe
upon my knees, I thought good to
use unto him these words in the
Latine tongue, <hi>Propitius sit tibi
Princeps Illustrissime Dominus no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Jesus Christus, &amp;c.</hi> As the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
I first met withall, so they, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the holy name of our <hi>Saviour,</hi>
they all, I say, King, Queen, and
all the rest fell downe upon their
knees, pronouncing a word or two
I understood not. They being risen
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:103664:46"/>
again, I proceeded thus, <hi>&amp; Maria
Salvator is Genitrix, Petrus &amp; Paulus
&amp;c.</hi> and so reckoning up a number
of Saints, to see if there were any
one of them that they honoured as
their patron, at last reckoning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
others <hi>St. Martinus,</hi> they all
bowed their bodies, and held up
hands in sign of great reverence: the
reason whereof I learned to be, that
<hi>Martin</hi> in their language signifieth
God: Then taking out my Jewells,
prepared for that purpose, I present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto the King or Prince (call
him how you please) 7. stones of so
many severall sorts, a Diamond, a
Rubie, an Emerauld, a Saphire, a
Topaz, a Turquez, and an Opall,
which he accepted with great joy &amp;
admiration, as having not often seen
any such before.</p>
                  <p>Then I offered unto the Queen
and Prince some other, and was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:103664:47"/>
to have bestowed a number of
more, upon other there present, but
<hi>Pylonas</hi> forbade them to accept,
thinking (as afterwards I learned)
that they were all I had, and being
willing they should be reserved for
<hi>Irdonozur</hi> his Soveraign.</p>
                  <p>This done, he imbraced me with
great kindnesse, and began to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of me divers things by signs,
which I likewise answered by signs
as well as I could.</p>
                  <p>But not being able to give him
content, he delivered me to a guard
of a 100. of his Giants (so I
may well call them) commanding
straightly,</p>
                  <p>First, that I should want nothing
that might be fit for me;</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that they should not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
any of the dwarfe <hi>Lunars</hi> (if I
may so tearme them) to come neer
me;</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:103664:47"/>Thirdly, that I should with all
diligence be instructed in their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
                  <p>And lastly, that by no means they
should impart unto me the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of certain things, particularly
by him specified; marry what those
particulars were, I might never by
any means get knowledge.</p>
                  <p>It may be now you will desire to
understand what were the things
<hi>Pylonas</hi> inquired of me.</p>
                  <p>Why what but these? whence
I came? how I arrived there? and
by what means? what was my
name? what my Errand? and such
like.</p>
                  <p>To all which I answered the very
truth as neer as I could.</p>
                  <p>Being dismissed, I was afforded
all manner of necessaries that my
heart could wish, so as it seemed
unto me I was in a very <hi>Paradise,</hi>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:103664:48"/>
the pleasures whereof notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
could not so overcome me, as
that the remembrance of my Wife
and Children, did not trouble me
much.</p>
                  <p>And therefore being willing to
foster any small sparke of hope of
my return, with great diligence I
took order for the attendance of
my Birds, (I mean my <hi>Gansa's</hi>)
whom my self in person tended e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
day with great carefulnesse;
All which notwithstanding had fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
out to little purpose, had not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens care performed that
which no indeavour of mine own
could.</p>
                  <p>For the time now approached,
when of necessity all the people
of our stature, (and so my self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the rest) must needs sleepe
for some 13. or 14. whole dayes
together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:103664:48"/>So it commeth to passe there by
a secret power, and unresistable
decree of nature, that when the
day beginneth to appear, and the
Moon to be enlightned by the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams,
(which is at the first Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of the Moon) all such people as
exceed not very much our stature
inhabiting those parts, they fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a dead sleep, and are not possibly
to be wakened till the Sun be set,
and withdrawn out of their sight,
even as <hi>Owles,</hi> and <hi>Batts,</hi> with us
cannot indure the light, so we there
at the first approach of the day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to be amazed with it, and fall
immediatly into a slumber, which
groweth by little and little, into a
dead sleepe, till this light depart
from thence againe, which is not in
14. or 15. dayes, to wit, untill the
last quarter.</p>
                  <p>Methinkes now I heare some
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103664:49"/>
man to demand what manner of
light there is in that world during
the absence of the <hi>Sun.</hi> To resolve
you for that point, you shall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
that there is a light of two
sorts.</p>
                  <p>One of the <hi>Sun</hi> (which I might
not endure to behold,) and another
of the Earth: that of the Earth was
now at the highest; for that when
the <hi>Moon</hi> is at the Change, then is
the Earth (unto them in the <hi>Moon</hi>)
like a full <hi>Moon</hi> with us; and as
the <hi>Moon</hi> increaseth with us, so
the light of the Earth decreaseth
with them: I then found the light
there (though the <hi>Sun</hi> were absent)
equall unto that with us, in the
day time, when the <hi>Sun</hi> is cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
with Clouds, but toward the
quarter it little and little diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
yet leaving still a competent
light, which is somewhat strange.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="89" facs="tcp:103664:49"/>But much stranger is that which
was reported unto me there, how
that in the other Hemisphere of the
<hi>Moon</hi> (I mean contrary to that
I happened upon,) where during
half the <hi>Moon,</hi> they see not the <hi>Sun,</hi>
and the Earth never appeareth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, they have notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a kinde of light (not unlike by
their description to our <hi>Moon</hi>-light)
which it seemeth the propinquintie
of the Starrs and other Planetts (so
much neerer unto them than us) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordeth.</p>
                  <p>Now you shall understand that
of the true <hi>Lunars</hi> there be three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
                  <p>Some beyond the pitch of our
stature a good deale, as perhaps 10
or 12 foot high, that can indure
the day of the <hi>Moon,</hi> when the
earth shineth but little, but not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the beams of both; at such
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:103664:50"/>
time they must be content to be laid
asleep.</p>
                  <p>Others there are of 20 foot high,
or somewhat more, that in ordinary
places indure all light both of earth
and Sun. Marrie there is a certain
<hi>Iland,</hi> the mysteries whereof none
may know, whose stature is not at
least 27 foot high (I mean of the
measure of the Sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dard of <hi>Castile</hi>) If
any other come a Land there in the
Moons day time, they fal asleep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly:
This <hi>Iland</hi> they call Gods
<hi>Iland,</hi> or <hi>Insula Martini</hi> in their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage:
they say it hath a particular
governour, who is (as they report) of
age 65000 <hi>Moons,</hi> which amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
to 5000 of our years, his name
is said to be <hi>Hiruch,</hi> and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth
after a sort over <hi>Irdonozur</hi>
himself, especially in that <hi>Iland</hi> out
of which he never cometh.</p>
                  <p>There is another, repairing much
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103664:50"/>
thither, they said is half his age
and upwards, to wit, about 33.
thousand <hi>Moons,</hi> or 26. hundred of
our years, and he commandeth in all
things (throughout the whole Globe
of the <hi>Moon</hi>) concerning matters of
Religion, and the service of God,
as absolutely as our holy Father
the <hi>Pope</hi> doth in any part of <hi>Italy.</hi>
I would faine have seen this man,
but I might not be suffered to
come neer him: his name is <hi>Imo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now give me leave to settle my
self to a long nights sleep: My at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants
take charge of my Birds,
prepare my lodging, and signifie
to me by signes, how it must be
with me. It was about the middle
of <hi>September,</hi> where I perceived
the Aire to grow more cleare than
ordinary, and with the increasing
of the light, I began to feele my
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103664:51"/>
selfe first dull, then heavy and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to sleep, although I had not
lately been hindred from taking
mine ease that way.</p>
                  <p>I delivered my self at last into the
custody of this sister of Death,
whose prisoner I was for almost a
fortnight after; Awaking then, it is
not to be believed how fresh, how
nimble, how vigorous, I found all
the faculties both of my body and
minde.</p>
                  <p>In good time, therefore, I setled
my self immediatly to the learning
of the language which (a marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
thing to consider) is one &amp; the
same throughout all the regions of
the Moon,) yet so much the lesse to
be wondred at, because I cannot
thinke all the Earth of Moon to
Amount to the fortieth part of our
inhabited Earth; partly because
the Globe of the Moone is much
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103664:51"/>
lesse than that of the Earth, and
partly because their Sea or Ocean
covereth in estimation Three parts
of Foure, (if not more) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
the <hi>superficies</hi> of our land may
be judged Equivalent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
in Measure to that of our
Seas.</p>
                  <p>The Difficulty of that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
is not to be conceived, and
the reasons thereof are especially
two:</p>
                  <p>First, because it hath no affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
with any other that ever I
heard.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because it consisteth
not so much of words and Letters,
as of tunes and uncouth sounds, that
no letters can express.</p>
                  <p>For you have few words but they
signifie divers and severall things,
and they are distinguished onely by
their tunes that are as it were sung
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:103664:52"/>
in the utterance of them, yea ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
words there are consisting of
tunes onely, so as if they list they
will utter their minds by tunes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
words: for Example, they
have an ordinary salutation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, signifying (<hi>Verba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim</hi>)
Glorie be to God alone,
which they express (as I take it,
for I am no perfect Musician) by
this tune without any words at
all.</p>
                  <gap reason="music">
                     <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <p>Yea the very names of Men
they will expresse in the same
sort.</p>
                  <p>When they were disposed to
talke of me before my face, so
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:103664:52"/>
as I should not perceive it; this was
<hi>Gonsales.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <gap reason="music">
                     <desc>〈♫〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <p>By occasion hereof, I discerne
means of framing a Language (and
that easie soon to be learned) as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
as any other in the world, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of tunes onely, whereof my
friends may know more at leasure if
it please them.</p>
                  <p>This is a great Mystery, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier
the searching after than at first
sight you would imagine.</p>
                  <p>Now notwithstanding the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
of this language, within two
moneths space I had attained unto
such knowledge of the same, as I
understood most questions to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of me, and what with signs,
what with words, made reasonable
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103664:53"/>
shift to utter my mind; which thing
being certified unto <hi>Pylonas,</hi> he sent
for me oftentimes, and would be
pleased to give me knowledge of
many things that my <hi>Guardians</hi>
durst not declare unto me.</p>
                  <p>Yet this I will say of them, that
they never abused me with any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth
that I could perceive; but if
I asked a question that they liked
not to resolve me in, they would
shake their heads, and with a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
shrugge passe over to other
talke.</p>
                  <p>After 7 months space it happened
that the great <hi>Irdonozur</hi> making
his progresse to a place some 200.
leagues distant from the Palace of
<hi>Pylonas,</hi> sent for me.</p>
                  <p>The History of that Journey, and
the conference that passed between
us, shall be related at large in my
second Booke. Onely thus much
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:103664:53"/>
thereof at this time, that he would
not admit me into his presence, but
talked with me through a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
where I might hear him, and
he both hear and see me at pleasure.
I offered him the remainder of my
Jewells, which he accepted very
thankfully; telling me, that he would
requite them with gifts of another
manner of value.</p>
                  <p>It was not above a Quarter of a
<hi>Moon</hi> that I stayed there, before I
was sent backe unto <hi>Pylonas</hi> again;
and so much the sooner, because if
we had stayed but a day or two
longer, the <hi>Sun</hi> would have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
us, before we could have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
our home.</p>
                  <p>The gifts he bestowed on me were
such as a Man would forsake moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of Gold for, and they were all
stones, to wit nine in number<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and
those of three sorts, whereof one
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:103664:54"/>
they call <hi>Poleastis,</hi> another <hi>Machrus,</hi>
and third <hi>Ebelus,</hi> of each sort three.
The first are of the bignesse of an
Hazell nut, very like unto Jet,
which among many other incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vertues hath this property, that
being once heat in the Fire, they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
after retaine their heat (though
without any appearance) untill they
be quenched with some kinde of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
whereby they receive no
detriment at all, though they be
heat and quenched ten thousand
times.</p>
                  <p>And their heat is so vehement,
as they will make red hot any met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
that shall come within a foot
of them, and being put in a Chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
will make a roome as warme,
as if a great fire were kindled in the
same.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Machrus</hi> (yet farre more
precious than the other) is of the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:103664:54"/>
colour of <hi>Topaz,</hi> so shining and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>splendent,
as (though not past the
bignesse of a Beane yet,) being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in the midst of a large Church
in the night time, it maketh it all as
light, as if a 100. Lamps were hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up round about it.</p>
                  <p>Can you wish for properties in
a stone of greater use than these.
Yes my <hi>Ebelus</hi> will af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that which I dare say will make you
preferre him before these, yea and
all the <hi>Diamonds, Saphyres, Rubies,</hi>
and <hi>Emeralds</hi> that our world can
yeeld, were they laid in a heap be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you;</p>
                  <p>To say nothing of the colour,
(the Lunar whereof I made menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
before, which notwithstanding is
so incredibly beautifull, as a man
should travell 1000 Leagues to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
it) the shape is somewhat flat
of the breadth of a <hi>Pistolett,</hi> and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103664:55"/>
twice the thickness. The one side of
this, which is somewhat more Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
of Colour than the other, being
clapt to the bare skin of a man, in
any part of his body, it taketh away
from it al weight or ponderousness;
whereas turning the other side it
addeth force unto the attractive
beam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> of the Earth, either in this
world or that, and maketh the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

it did before; do you marvell now
why I should so overprize this
stone? before you see me on earth
againe, you shall understand more
of the value of this kinde and unva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable
Jem.</p>
                  <p>I inquired then amongst them,
whether they had not any kind of

                     </gap> men respected me
more than before: my Guardians,
which hitherto were very nice in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
any thing to me, concerning
the government of that world, now
became somewhat more open, so as
I could learne (partly of them, and
partly of <hi>Pylonas,</hi>) what I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
unto you concerning that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:103664:56"/>
whereof I will onely give you a

part, which at my returne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Spaine</hi> you shall have at large; but
not till then, for causes heretofore
related.</p>
                  <p>In a thousand years it is not found
that there is either Whoremonger
amongst them, whereof these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are to be yielded: There is no

                  <p>Food groweth every where with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

for a man to want, or desire, it
is provide by the command of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,

absolute beauty: and I know not
how it commeth to passe by a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
disposition of nature there that
a man having once known a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
never desireth any other. As
for murther, it was never heard of
amongst them; neither is it a thing
almost possible to be committed:
for there is no wound to be given
which may not be cured: they
assured me, (and I for my part
doe believe it,) that although a
mans head be cut off, yet if any
time within the space of Three
Moons it be put together, and
joyned to the Carkasse againe,
with the appointment of the Juice
of a certaine hearbe, there grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng,
it will be joyned together
againe, so as the partie wounded
shall become perfectly whole in a

                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:103664:57"/>But the chief cause, is, that through
an excellent disposition of that sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of people there, all, young and
old, do hate all manner of vice, and
do live in such love, peace, and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
as it seemeth to be another Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise.
True it is, that some are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
disposed than other: but that
they discerne immediately at the
time of their birth.</p>
                  <p>And because it is an inviolable
decree amongst them, never to put
any one to death, perceiving by the
stature, and some other notes they
have, who are likely to be of a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
or imperfect disposition, they
send them away (I know not by
what means) into the Earth, and
change them for other children,
before they shall have either abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
or opportunitie to do amisse a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them: But first (they say)
they are faine to keepe them there

for a certain space, till that the Aire
of the Earth may alter their colour
to be like unto ours.</p>
                  <p>And their ordinary vent for them
is a certain high hill in the North of
<hi>America,</hi> whose people I can easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believe to be wholly descended

the <hi>Lunars</hi> use exceeding much, as
living in a place abounding wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

in some other respects, too long now
to be rehearsed. Sometimes they
mistake their aime, and fall upon
Christendome, <hi>Asia</hi> or <hi>Affricke,</hi>
marry that is but seldome: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
some years since, that I

                  <p>Then see <hi>Inigo Mondejar</hi> in his
description of <hi>Nueva Granata,</hi> the

de Carana,</hi> in his history of <hi>Mexico:</hi>
if my memory faile me not, you
will find that in these, which will

                  <p>May I once have the happinesse
to return home in safety, I will yield
such demonstrations, of all I deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
as shall quickly make void all

                  <p>If you will aske me further of the
manner of government amongst
the Lunars, and how Justice is exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted?

Alas what need is there of Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary

                  <p>And as little need is there of
Physicians; they never misdiet
themselves, their Aire is alwayes
temperate and pure, neither is there
any occasion at all of sicknes, as to
me it seemed at least, for I could
not hear that ever any of them were

by this voyage am I sufficiently as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
that ere long the race of my

a greater happiness elsewhere, and
that everlasting.</p>
                  <p>It was the Ninth day of <hi>September</hi>
that I began to ascend from <hi>El Pico;</hi>
twelve dayes I was upon my Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and arrived in that Region of
the Moon, that they call <hi>Simiri,
September</hi> the 21. following.</p>
                  <p>The 12. day of <hi>May</hi> being Friday
we came unto the Court of the great
<hi>Irdonozur,</hi> and returned backe the
Seventeenth unto the Palace of <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonas,</hi>
there I continued till the
month of <hi>March,</hi> in the yeare 1601.
at what time I earnestly besought
<hi>Pylonas</hi> (as I had often done before)
to give me leave to depart, (though
with never so great hazard of my
life) backe into the earth againe.</p>
                  <p>He much disswaded me, laying
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:103664:60"/>
before me the danger of the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
the misery of that place from
whence I came, and the abundant
happinesse of that I now was in; But
the remembrance of my Wife and
children overweighed all these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and to tell you the truth I was
so far forth moved with a desire of
that deserved glory, that I might
purchase at my return, as me thought:
I deserved not the name of a <hi>Spany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi>
if I would not hazard 20 lives,
rather than loose but a little possibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of the same. Wherfore I answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
him, that my desire of seing my
children was such, as I knew I could
not live any longer, if I were once
out of hope of the same. When then
he desired one years stay longer, I
told him it was manifest I must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
now or never: My <hi>Birds</hi> began
to droop, for want of their wonted
migration, three of them were now

for ever destitute of all possibility

                     </gap>mmed up mine Engine,
and took my leave of <hi>Pylonas,</hi> who
(for all the courtesie he had done
me) required of me but one thing,
which was, faithfully to promise
him, that if ever I had means
thereunto, I should salute from
him <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whom he tearmed
the great Queen of <hi>England,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
her the most glorious of all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
living; and indeed he would
often question with me of her, and
therein delighted so much, as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
he was never satisfied in talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:103664:61"/>
of her; he also delivered unto
me a token or present for her of no
small Value: Though I account her
an enemy of <hi>Spaine,</hi> I may not faile
of performing this promise as soon
as I shall be able so to do: upon the
29. day of <hi>March</hi> being Thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
3. dayes after my awaking from
the last Moons light, I fastened my
self to mine Engine, not forgetting
to take with me, besides the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
<hi>Irdonozur</hi> had given me (with
whose use and vertues <hi>Pylonas</hi> had
acquainted me at large) a small
quantitie of Victuall, wherefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
I had great use, as shall be
declared.</p>
                  <p>An infinite multitude of people,
(and amongst the rest <hi>Pylonas</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
being present,) after I had given
him the last <hi>Bezalos manos,</hi> I let loose
the raines unto my <hi>Birds,</hi> who with
great greediness taking wing quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:103664:62"/>
carried me out of their sight, it fel
out with me as in my first passage, I
never felt either hunger or thirst, till
I arrived in <hi>China</hi> upon a high
mountain, some 5 Leagues from the
high and mighty City of <hi>Pachin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Voyage was performed in
lesse than 9 dayes; I heard no news
by the way of these airie men, which
I had seen in my ascending.</p>
                  <p>Nothing stayed my journey any
whit at all: Whether it was the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
desire of my <hi>Birds,</hi> to return to
the Earth, where they had missed
one season, or that the attraction of
the Earth so much stronger than
that of the Moon, furthered their
labour; so it came to passe; although
now I had 3 <hi>Birds</hi> wanting of those
I carried forth with me.</p>
                  <p>For the first 8 days my <hi>Birds</hi> flew
before, and I with the Engine was
as it were drawn by them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:103664:62"/>
The Ninth day when I began to
approach unto the Clouds, I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
my self and mine Engine to
sink towards the Earth, and go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
them.</p>
                  <p>I was then horribly afraid, lest
my <hi>Birds,</hi> not being able to bear our
weight, they being so few, should be
constrained to precipitate both me
and themselves head long to the
Earth: wherefore I thought it no
less than needfull to make use of the
<hi>Ebelus,</hi> (one of the stones bestowed
upon me by <hi>Irdono <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ur,</hi>) which I
clapped to my bare flesh within my
hose: and it appeared manifestly
thereupon unto me that my <hi>Birds</hi>
made their way with much greater
ease than before, as being lightned
of a great burthen; neither do I think
it possible for them to have let me
down safely unto the Earth without
that help.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:103664:63"/>
                     <hi>China</hi> is a Countrey so popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
as I thinke there is hardly a
piece of ground to be found (in
the most barren parts of the same)
though but thrice a mans length,
which is not most carefully manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.
I being yet in the Aire, some of
the Country people had espied me,
&amp; came running unto me by troops,
they seised upon me, and would
needs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> by and by, carrie me unto
an Officer. I seeing no other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
yielded my selfe unto them.
But when I assayed to go, I found
my selfe so light, that I had much
adoe, one foote being upon the
ground, to set downe the other,
that was by reason of my <hi>Ebelus,</hi>
so applyed, as it tooke quite away
all weight and ponderousnesse from
my body: Wherefore bethinking
my selfe what was to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> done, I
fained a desire of performing the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:103664:63"/>
necessitie of nature, which by signes
being made known unto them (for
they understood not a word of any
Language I could speak) they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
me to go aside among a few
bushes, assuring themselves that for
me to escape from them it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible;
Being there I remembred
the directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s <hi>Pylonas</hi> had given me,
concerning the use of my stones,
and first I took them all together,
with a few Jewells yet remaining of
those I had brought out of <hi>India,</hi>
and knit them up in my handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
all, except one the least and
worst <hi>Ebelus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Him I found means to apply in
such sort unto my body, as but the
halfe of his side touched my skin,
whereby it came to passe that my
body then had but half the weight,
that being done I drew towards
these my Guardians, till seeing them
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103664:64"/>
come somewhat neer together they
could not crosse my way, I shewed
them a fair paire of heeles.</p>
                  <p>This I did to the end I might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
an opportunity of finding my
Stones, and Jewells, which I knew
they would rob me off, if I preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them not.</p>
                  <p>Being thus lightned, I bid them
such a base, as had they been all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the backs of so many <hi>Zebra's,</hi>
they could never have overtaken
me: I directed my course unto a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
thick wood, into which I entred
some quarter of a League, and then
finding a pretty spring, (which I
took for my marke) hard by it, I
thrust my Jewells into a little hole
made by a Want, or some such like
creature.</p>
                  <p>Then I took out of my pocket
my Victualls, (to which in all my
Voyage I had not till then any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire)
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:103664:64"/>
and refreshed my self there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
til such time as the people pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
me, had overtaken me, into
whose hands I quietly delivered my
self.</p>
                  <p>They led me unto a mean Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,
who (understanding that once
I had escaped from them that first
apprehended me,) caused a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
seat to be made of boords, into
which they closed me in such sort,
as onely my head was at liberty,
and then carried me upon the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of 4 slaves, (like some notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
malefactor) before a man of
great authority, whom in their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
(as after I learned) they called
a <hi>Mandarine,</hi> abiding two days jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
off, to wit one League distant
from the great and famous City of
<hi>Pachin,</hi> or <hi>Paquin,</hi> by the <hi>Chinesse</hi>
called <hi>Suntien.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their language I could no way
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:103664:65"/>
understand; onely this I could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne,
that I was for something or
other accused with a great deale of
vehemence.</p>
                  <p>The substance of this accusation
it seemes was, that I was a <hi>Magician,</hi>
as witnessed my strange carriage in
the aire; that being a stranger, as
appeared by my both language and
habit, I contrary to the Lawes of
<hi>China,</hi> entred into the Kingdome
without warrant, and that proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
with no good intent. The <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darine</hi>
heard them out, with a great
deale of composed gravitie; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a man of quicke apprehension,
and withall studious of novelties,
he answered them, that he would
take such order with me, as the case
required, and that my bold attempt
should not want its deserved punish<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment.
But having dismissed them,
he gave order to his Servants, that I
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:103664:65"/>
should be kept in some remote parts
of his vast Palace, and be strictly
watched, but courteously used: This
doe I conjecture, by what at the
present I found, and what after
followed. For my accommodation
was every way better, than I could
expect; I lodged well, fared well,
was attended well, and could not
fault any thing, but my restraint.
In this manner did I continue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
moneths, afflicted with nothing
so much as with the thought of my
<hi>Gansa's;</hi> which I knew must be irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverably
lost, as indeed they were.
But in this time, by my own indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
and the forwardness of those
that accompanied me, I was grown
indifferent ready in the ordinary
language of that Province, (for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
every Province in <hi>China,</hi> hath
its proper Language) whereat I
discerned they tooke no small con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:103664:66"/>
I was at length to take the aire,
and brought into the spacious gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of that Palace, a place of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
pleasure, and delight, as being
planted with herbes and Flowers of
admirable both sweetnes &amp; beauty,
and almost infinite variety of fruits
both <hi>European</hi> &amp; others, &amp; all those
composed with that rare curiosity,
that I was ravished with the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of such delightfull objects.
But I had not here long recreated
my self, yet the <hi>Mandarine</hi> entred
the Garden, on that side where I was
walking, and being advertised there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
by his servants, &amp; wished to kneel
down to him (as I after found it to
be the usuall publique reverence to
those great Officers) I did so, and
humbly craved his favour towards a
poor stranger, that arrived in those
parts not by his own destination, but
by the secret disposal of the heavens:
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:103664:66"/>
He in a different language (which al
the <hi>Mandarines,</hi> as I have since lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
do use) and that like that of the
Lunars did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sist much of tunes, but
was by one of his servants interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to me. He, I say, wished me to be
of good comfort, for that he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
no harm unto me, and so passed
on. The next day was I commanded
to come before him, and so condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
into a sumptuous dining roome
exquisitely painted and adorned.
The <hi>Mandarine</hi> having comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
all to avoid the room, vouchsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
conference with me in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
language; inquiring first the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
of my Countrey, the power of
my Prince, the religion &amp; manners
of the people; wherein being satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by me, he at last descended to
the particulars of my education and
studies, and what brought me into
this remote country: Then did I at
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:103664:67"/>
large declare unto him the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of my life, onely omitting here
&amp; there, what particulars I thought
good, forbearing especially any me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the stones given me by <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donozur.</hi>
The strangenes of my sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
did much amaze him. And find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in all my discourse nothing any
way tending to Magick; (wherein
he had hoped by my means to have
gaind some knowledge) he began to
admire the excellencie of my wit,
applauding me for the happiest
man, that this world had ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced:
and wishing me to repose my
self after my long narration, he for
that time dismissed me. After this,
the <hi>Mandarine</hi> took such delight in
me, that no day passed, wherein he
sent not for me. At length he advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
me to apparell my self in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
of the Country (which I willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
did) and gave me not only the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:103664:67"/>
of his house, but took me also
abroad with him, when he went to
<hi>Paquin,</hi> whereby I had the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie
by degrees to learn the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the people, and the policy of
the Country, which I shall reserve
for my second part. Neither did I
by this my attendance on him gain
only the knowledge of these things,
but the possibility also of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to my native soyl, and to
those dear pledges which I value a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the world, my Wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
For by often frequenting <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi>
I at length heard of some Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the Society that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
famous for the extraordinary
favour by the King vouchsafed
them, to whom they had presented
some <hi>European</hi> trifles, as Clocks,
Watches, Dials, and the like, which
with him passed for exquisite rari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
To them by the <hi>Mandarines</hi>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:103664:68"/>
leave, I repaired, was welcomed by
them, they much wondring to see a
Lay <hi>Spaniard</hi> there, whither they
had with so much difficulty obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
leave to arrive. There did I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
to Father <hi>Pantoja,</hi> and those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the society these fore-rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
adventures, by whose directions
I put them in writing, and sent this
story of my fortunes to <hi>Macao,</hi> from
thence to be coveighed for <hi>Spaine,</hi>
as a forerunner of my return. And
the <hi>Mandarine</hi> being very indulgent
unto me, I came often unto the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
with whom I consulted about
many secrets with them; also did I
lay a foundation for my returne, the
blessed houre whereof I do with
patience expect; that by inriching
my Country with the knowledge of
hidden mysteries, I may once reape
the glory of my fortunate misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 IT cannot be imagined,
that any one who hath
but the lest knowledge
in Philosophy, should
be ignorant, that, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be perceived by human un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
without the help of the
exteriour Senses, so that he that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
to communicate the secrets of
his minde to one either absent or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
it is altogether necessary that he
have an accesse by this way.</p>

one mans minde unto another,
and as it were joyn them both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
unless peradventure sometimes
another <hi>Pallas</hi> be found, who (as <hi>Tacitus</hi>

was wont to comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

no other way than by writing, or
nodding with his head.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 They who would declare any
thing to their freind that is absent, and
yet will not trust to the fidelity of the
Messenger, do present that unto their
Eyes, which they cannot, or at least
think not safe to do unto the Ears; to
which end and purpose the indicting of
Letters, being the interpreters of our
minde, began to be in common use;
which for the most part do faithfully
perform that Arrant whereon they
are sent, unless when the trechery or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:103664:79"/>
negligence of those that carry them,
or the impediments of the journey
cause that these Demonstrations of
our minde, come not to the place to
which they are destinated.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 There are m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ny several remedies of
these inconveniencies invented by the
Antients, which not only seem to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate
the way, and to point out fit
Messengers not easily to be corrupted,
but also they promise a kind of swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as is beyond the power of man,
unless he like another <hi>Perseus</hi> can pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase
I know not what winged <hi>Pegasus</hi>
for the conveyance of himselfe and
Letters.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 It will not repent me of my labour
in reckoning up their Inventions of
this sort, as I finde them recorded by
the penns of Historians, that at the
last when I have given, in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
a description of this my Nuncio,
and have related what he promiseth,
then it may be made known to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:103664:80"/>
Reader how far our inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
exceed and go beyond those of
the Ancients.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 <hi>Cecinna</hi> of <hi>Volatera,</hi> a Noble
man of <hi>Rome</hi> (according to the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie
of <hi>Pliny</hi>) bringing with him
into the City, Swallows that had been
taken, sent them with tidings of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
unto his freinds, painting them with
the colour which betokens Victory:
And <hi>Fabius Pictor</hi> also relates in his
Annales, that when a Roman Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
was besieged by the <hi>Ligurians,</hi>
that there was a Swallow, brought
from her young ones to him, with a
peice of thred tied unto one of her
leggs, that he should signify by the
knots what day he would come with
more, aid that they might make a Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
And <hi>Decimus Brutus,</hi> at the siege
of <hi>Modena,</hi> sent Letters that were tied
at the feet of Pigeons into the Tents
of the Consulls <hi>Hirtius</hi> and <hi>Pansa,</hi>
who came to his releife against <hi>Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:103664:80"/>
7 But that invention of the AEgip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
Mamalucks dwelling at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi>
doth far exceced all these, of
whom <hi>Bernard</hi> de <hi>Bridenbach</hi> Dean of
<hi>Mentz,</hi> thus writeth; Although, saith
he, perchance it may seem incredible,
yet nevertheless what I shall declare,
really came to pass: <hi>Amiraldus</hi> had
allwaies with him some tutored Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which were so taught, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they flew, they would at length
return to the Court of <hi>Amiraldus;</hi>
Now those Pilots that are sent out to
meet with Ships sayling to the Port
of <hi>Alexandria</hi> to be their conduct,
carry two or three Pigeons along with
them to Sea, till they come even to
the place where they make full search,
where presently they draw up an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory
containing those things that
are necessary to be known, which they
hang at the neck of one of the Pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and so let it fly away, who by its
continuall and restless motion, soon
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103664:81"/>
arrives with the Schedule at the Table
of <hi>Amiraldus,</hi> and shews who they are
that are a comming: But if after the
sending forth of the first Pigeon, any
thing more is to be made known to
<hi>Amiraldus,</hi> presently they send forth
a second, and so a third, if there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
need: So that <hi>Amiraldus</hi> perfectly
knowes who and what they are, a long
time before ever the Ships enter into
the Harbour. It is also affirmed, that
he hath other Doves, which he sends
to the Sultan at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Cairo,</hi> by which he
signifies that some suddain and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
busines hath hapned; Moreover
if the Pilots sent out from <hi>Amiraldus,</hi>
cannot finde out the conditions of the
Ship, they declare this very thing to
him by the Doves.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 By these and the like means we
finde sometimes a thing may be made
known in a short space, but it is all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
done by Birds who are the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riers,
whereas we promise to exhibit
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103664:81"/>
an Inter-Nuncio, who is not a Bird,
neither is he winged, no not so much
as a living Creature, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
by many degrees goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
any creature whatsoever, though
never so swift in celerity of motion.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 That invention of theirs cometh
somewhat nigh to our purpose, who
by fires that were kindled in the night,
and by smoke in the day, which may
be perceived in a short space of time,
did declare their intents to their
friends that were far distant. Thus
did the Grecians when they were at
<hi>Chios,</hi> to their Confederates who
pitched their Tents at <hi>Artemisium,</hi>
and <hi>Mardonius</hi> the Persian, from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi>
even to <hi>Asia,</hi> as it is asserted by
<hi>Herodotus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10 Yet they (as much as I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
could not shew by these signes
every thing which was expedient, but
onely that one thing, about which
they had agreed before among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:103664:82"/>
that <hi>Athens</hi> was taken in that
moment of time, or that there was
a marching down into the Enemies
Quarters just then, when in those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
they had either kindled a fire or
raised a smoke.</p>
                  <p n="11">11 For my part I think that to be a
more ingenuous exploit of the <hi>Tybere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
related by <hi>Suetonius,</hi> who at the
same time when this wicked Monster
rioted in the Island of <hi>Caprea,</hi> and
then chiefely when he endeavoured
to curbe the haughty spirit of <hi>Sejanus,</hi>
commanded signalls to be erected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far
off (lest the Messengers should
slack their speed) to be lifted up high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
that he might understand before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
what was done; whose words
seem to intimate thus much, that <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi>
devised this way, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
dwelling in the Island, might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
all things nedful to be known
(by these Signes that were then lifted
up) in the Continent or Main land.</p>
                  <p n="12">
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:103664:82"/>
12 In which particular, if I am not
much mistaken, it is easily to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
how it comes to pass, that this kind
of art, thus declaring the very secrets
of our minde without the help of any
Messenger, to those that are absent a
great way from us, should alltogether
decay in this our <hi>Europe;</hi> or at least
should from that time to this never be
used, as I finde in reading Classick
Histories.</p>
                  <p n="13">13 I say in this our <hi>Europe,</hi> for it is
most certain, that even to this day it is
in great perfection among the Cathay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
as appears by the testimony of
<hi>Augerius Busbequius;</hi> to doubt of
whose fidellity, would be allmost Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acular,
unless he leaned on another
mans credit; hear himself thus speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p n="14">14 After the travell of many a month
we came at last to the very straights and
skirts of the Kingdom of <hi>Cathay,</hi> for
a good part of the Dominions of the
King of <hi>Cathay</hi> is Mediterranean,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103664:83"/>
encompassed with sleep and untractable
Mountains, and dangerous Rocks, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can any one enter into it but by the
narrow passages thereof, which are kept
by the Kings Garrison; there the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
are questioned what they bring,
from whence they come, and how many
there are of them; which being known,
the Watchmen appointed by the King,
shew it in the day time by smoke, in the
night by fire to the next high hill, that
in like manner to the next, and so one
after another; so that in the space of a
few houres, which a Messenger could not
do in many daies, newes is brought to
the King of <hi>Cathay</hi> of the arivall of
those Merchants, who answers with the
like swiftness and in the same manner,
whether it stands with his good pleasure
that all should be admitted, or that they
should partly be excluded or deferred.</p>
                  <p n="15">15 Our Ancestors were not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
that from high Hills of this kind
(which we in <hi>England</hi> call Beacons)
a thing might be made manifest, from
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:103664:83"/>
whom also we have derived this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome,
that by their help we give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the invasion of a forein Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
But by by this means onely, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
to relate the exact number of
Men and Beasts, Nation, Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
and things needfull to be known,
seems to be a more abstruse and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
work than (as I think) to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by the subtilty of a barbarous
Nation alltogether ignorant of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy,
aswell Humane as Divine.
And let this suffice to be spoken about
Sight, which, not without just cause, the
Prince of Orators stiles the sharpest
of all the Senses.</p>
                  <p n="16">16 That now we may pass from the
eys the ears, by reading hitherto. I have
not yet found any way either invented
by the Ancients, or put in practise by
any of our time, whereby a man that
is a far distant may receive notice of
any business by the benefit of this
sense, unless by the speech of the
Messenger that goes to each.</p>
                  <p n="17">
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:103664:84"/>17 Yet to this belongeth that which
Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> the Son of all Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
(especially of our British) hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to publick view in these words;
The Inhabitants of the Picts Wall
(which <hi>Severus</hi> built at the Northerne
part of <hi>England</hi>) do report that there
was a brazen Pipe put into the wall,
with that rare artifice that it run
through each Tower and Castell,
(Pieces, whereof they now and then
find) that if any one did but sound his
voyce into it, let him be in what Tower
soever, presently the sound went into
the next, and so to the third, so that the
sound passed through each of them,
without any interruption, to signify
where about they feared the assault of
the enemy; <hi>Xiphiline</hi> in the life of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verus</hi>
relates a wonder of the same
kind in the Towers of <hi>Constantinople:</hi>
but whereas saith he the Wall is now
demolished, and the Pipe is not to
be found, many here on every side
hold their Lands of our Kings suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103664:84"/>
in Cornage as the Lawyers
phrase is, that by the sound of a Horne
they should signifie to their neighbours
the irruptions of an Enemic, which
some think to be borrowed from the
old Roman custome: thus far <hi>Camb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
who in these words hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised
all the inventions of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
tending to this end.</p>
                  <p n="18">18 Perchance it will not be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
impertinent, that after we have
spoken somewhat about seeing and
hearing, we should say a little about
touching, by the help of which sense
that any thing should be signified to
them that are afar off, especially with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Messenger is not yet asserted of
any one as I think, neither doth it seem
credible, but for my part I dare say
that it may be done, and that with ease,
at the distance of a mile or perchance
two, although I have not tryed the
verity thereof by any experiment, and
I list not to say whether it wil be worth
our labour for the future.</p>
                  <p n="19">
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:103664:85"/>
19 But that which concernes those
senses (to wit, of seeing and hearing)
I dare say and do confidently assert,
that a man skilfull in this art may tell
whatsoever he pleases or thinks, may
conduce to his good, to another that is
afar off if a like skilfull (if he be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a quarter of a mile) though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged,
or lying hid, or perchance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in any place which is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
knowne to him that sends the
tydings, and if knowne, yet not to be
gone to; Let nobody come near him,
secure the body in a prison, let the
hands be bound, hoodwink the face,
but be not trouble some any other way,
and he shall understand the words of
his absent friends, if this liberty be
not taken away from him, that he may
be able to do those things which are
wont sometimes to be done by Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
or may do them without fear or
danger.</p>
                  <p n="20">20 I say moreover, that if the place
be known where a friend resides, to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:103664:85"/>
whom our message should be brought,
and if both enjoy a full liberty, the
causes being before agreed upon,
which conduce to the disposition of
the meanes, any thing may be told to
such a friend without any Messenger
going between each, or any living
creature, though he be a hundred, nay
perchance a thousand miles off, and
that in a short space of time, perchance
an hour, or it may be somewhat less.</p>
                  <p n="21">21 These things some whisperingly
say are strange and wonderfull, but
they are not so soone to be believed:
but doth this seeme so wonderfull and
uncredible. You have yet but this only
in the <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species,</hi> behold an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuall
is presented to thy eyes,
which thou wilt less believe. Tell unto
this my <hi>Nuncio</hi> at <hi>London</hi> in as few
words as may be, what you desire may
be told to me dwelling at <hi>Bristol, Wells,</hi>
or if you will rather at <hi>Exeter,</hi> for I
do not much regard the length of the
way, so it is but passable; I say tell him
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103664:86"/>
at <hi>London,</hi> and that just about noone
any one whole verse of the sacred
Scripture, I will see that he shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
our commands in the designed
place (marke what I say) before the
high noone of the same day.</p>
                  <p n="22">22 Do not rashly pronounce this
proposall impossible, for the course of
the Sun makes the noone later by some
minutes at <hi>Bristol</hi> than at <hi>London:</hi> this it
is you may wonder at, that this Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
should exceed the heavenly moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thereof in swiftness. This he will
do, will do it I say, if there be need,
or else I am the vainest person of all
that know how either to speake or
write.</p>
                  <p n="23">23 What speak I of Towers, or Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
that are besieged? our inanimate
Nuncio, not fearing any thing, will pass
through whole troops of enemies;
A trench digg'd almost as low as hell,
or a wall though higher than those of
<hi>Babylon,</hi> shall not hinder his journey,
but he will faithfully performe the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103664:86"/>
message (so it be in as concise termes
as may be) of him that sent him, though
besieged, or whether he would have it
told to him that is besieged, and that
with such an incredible swiftnes, if he
be to be found within 5. or 7. miles,
though I doubt not but it may be done
effectually within 20. miles.</p>
                  <p n="24">24 You have here 3. promises of this
my Nuncio, presented to your consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
perchance it will be worth
our while to shew how they differ a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
themselv's for perspicuities sake.</p>
                  <p n="25">25 In the first I set forth the subtlety
of deceiving: in the 2 <hi>d.</hi> the swiftness
of its passage: in the 3 <hi>d.</hi> its unconque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
power and strength in penetrating
all things.</p>
                  <p n="26">26 That in the first place will easily
be performed without any cost or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of any one, save him that sends,
but it hath this inconvenience, that its
frequent use will not be free from sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition.</p>
                  <p n="27">27 That in the second place is very
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103664:87"/>
often effected, without any help from
others, and in some places almost with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any charge, but for the most part
it will do little or nothing without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
and that such that for each
mile it will cost five pounds more or
less, if it be designed for perpetual use,
and nothing can be done without the
countenance and authority of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
who can easily, if he please,
hinder our Nuncios journey.</p>
                  <p n="28">28 As concerning the third, truely
it requireth no great charge, but it must
be observed, that he that doth act, be
setled in a place without danger, and
that not too far distant, where he may
resist his enemies force, untill he hath
perfected his work, and here we must
not deny, that the condition of him
that sends in, than of him that sends out
is the worst.</p>
                  <p n="29">29 You seem to me, O Reader, to
ask by what sense, a friend may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
those things that are to be told,
for the senses are the guard, Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103664:87"/>
and Messengers of the Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
(so <hi>Cicero</hi>) by which alone we
come to understand: I answer somtimes
by hearing, and sometimes by sight;
You ask a reason how? you shall have
it in few terms, and perchance not so
clearly, but that you require examples.</p>
                  <p n="30">30 If you desire to represent any
thing to the eyes of your absent friend,
I say absent, and at a great distance soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
than any sublunary body can come
to the place that is separated by so long
an intervall, for I undertake that) we
must see that the <hi>Idaeas</hi> or visible forms
be increased in quantity, multiplyed in
number, and be varied according to
the variety of the things, to be signified
in quality, quantity, position or order.</p>
                  <p n="31">31 There is none but knowes that
nothing can be perceived by the eares
without a sound, it is therefore necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
that he to whom any thing is to be
declared by the mediation of hearing,
should heare those sounds, and those
must be distinguished according to the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103664:88"/>
number of the things to be heard,
which because they are infinite, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of sounds that are to be echoed
forth must be infinite also: nevertheless
it will be sufficient, that they be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
either in the kind, or time, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and number.</p>
                  <p n="32">32 He that shall rightly understand
(and by examples they are more clear
than the Sun in its meridian splendor)
how sounds of this nature are repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to a place far distant will never
question the verity hereof.</p>
                  <p n="33">33 And here lest any one should ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merously
suspect these things to be
effected by unlawfull and condemned
arts, in the presence of that God who
is both the greatest and the best: I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test,
and openly denounce, that this
discipline contains in it nothing that is
unlawfull, or that is contrary to the
Laws either of God or man, and that
many things are done by the help of
Arithmetick, Geometry and Musick,
the rest if not by usuall, yet by lawfull
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103664:88"/>
means, and that at a very small cost, I
had almost said none at all, for certainly
many things may be performed in this
kind without the least expence or loss
that can be imagined.</p>
                  <p n="34">34 And seeing that it is so, I leave
it to the judgment of those that are
judicious to consider how much and
how far these our inventions may be
profitable to the Common-wealth for
the future: if they are defective, let
them dye, and as untimely birth let
them not see the light, or if they chance
to see the light, let them not enjoy a
little, but forthwith let them vanish
into nothing.</p>
                  <p n="35">35 Yet I my self think the use of
this art to be very great, as well in times
of Peace as War, and I thought it
my duty to bestow some pains in the
delivery thereof, which I will not do
so willingly, lest that when it shall be
made known to many, we cannot use or
practise these things in their due time.</p>
