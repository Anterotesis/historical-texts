            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>With these prophets the Church was so troubled and disquieted in S. <hi>Iohns</hi> time, that (as it seemed) some cared for no spirit, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, nor doctrine: and some were so giddy headed, that in a maner every spirit conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, which caused the Apostle to vse in effect these words: to the one sort, Beleev<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>After the Apostles times, as it were out of the ashes of these false prophets, there grew and sproong up so many other schismat<add>ikes</add> and heretikes: as <hi>Irenaeus, Tertullian, Epip<add>hani</add>us,</hi> and S. <hi>Augustine</hi> do testifie, that the <add>verie</add> name of Christ began to be odious <add>among</add>

            <p>Of this number I may verie well account the late obstinate heretike <hi>Francis Ket,</hi> who <note place="margin">Ket.</note> was within these two months brent at Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich.

            <p>Heere you see there is great vehemencie used, and very sharpe applications are urged,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8671:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
A man would thinke that if the grounde of this government were not more cleere then the sunne, and so determined of by all the godlie and learned in the worlde ever since Christs time, they could never be halfe so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute or earnest.</p>
            <p>But heerein they passe indeede the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of a modest mans conceite. For there was never ancient father since the Apostles times, were he never so learned or studious of the truth: there was never particular Church, councell or synode, or any man of judgement that ever lived till these latter times (as I thinke, and I have taken paines for the search thereof) that did ever so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and interpret that place: or that ever did so much as once dreame of anie such meaning.</p>
            <p>Besides, it is most manifest that there hath been a diverse governement from this used in the church ever since the apostles times: and these men themselves confesse that long before the councell of Nice this their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment began greatly to decay: and that since the said councell it was never heard of in christendome untill these their times.</p>
            <p>A verie strange matter if it were true, that Christ should erect a forme of governement for the ruling of his Church to continue from his departure out of the world untill
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:8671:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his comming againe: and that the same should never be once thought of or put in practise for the space of 1500. yeers, or at the least (to take them at the best) that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement and kingdome of Christ shoulde then bee overthrowne, when by all mens confessions the divinitie of his person, the vertue of his priesthood, the power of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice as he is a prophet, and the honor of his kinglie authoritie, was so godlie, so learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, and so mightilie established against the Arrians, in the councell of Nice, as that the confession of the Christian faith then set <note place="margin">Concil. <add>2 Nice</add>

            <p>Thus all heretikes and schismatikes have done from the beginning, wherein they are greatly to be woondred at. For this hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been reckoned a most certaine ground and principle in religion, that that Church <note place="margin">

But that you may yet farther see <hi>Martins</hi> boldnes (I might say either his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice or ignorance) it may please you to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande, what account was made in the church of God in those daies of <hi>Aerius</hi> gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saying and impugning of the superioritie of Bishops. For if then his opinion prevailed, the favorers of the same cause now have some what to boast of: but indeed it fell out far otherwise. For it appeereth in <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> after due triall and examination made by the learned fathers who then lived, of all his arguments and sleights which he used for the proofe of his assertions, that with a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall consent of the whole church his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were overthrowen, and he himselfe persisting in them was condemned for an heretike.

in the defence of religion against such here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes and schismatikes as the church of God did then abound and slow withal, did them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves take upon them the offices of Bishops: and till this day there was never any but he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes, and such lewd persons, who did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them antichristian.</p>

have reckoned this dotage to be the verie beginning and fosterer of heretikes: <hi>Initia haereticorum, &amp;c.</hi> The beginning of heresies is (saith <hi>Cyprian) Vt sibi placeant:</hi> When men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to please themselves. For then (as <hi>Ierome</hi>

            <p>Alledge against them the generall consent of all the ancient fathers, and they esteeme it not a rush. He is but of a meane conceite among them who will sticke to say (as <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi>

            <p>But I would to God this matter were not evident by experience amongst our selves.

For saie they (as it appeereth in the late admonition to the people of England, as I conceive by the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces there noted) our preachers ought to conforme themselves to the example of Christ and his Apostles. Their Master had not a house to put his head in. The apostles
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:8671:15"/>
their predecessors had neither gold nor sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, possessions, riches, goods, nor revenues: and why then should they being in gifts and paines inferior unto them, have greater pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments in the world then they had?

The earth is the Lords and the fulnes thereof. You have an equall portion with the best in the kindome of God: and will you suffer this unequall distribution of these worldlie benefits? Consider how in the apostles time the faithfull had all things common. They came and laid their goods at the Apostles feet, and division was therof made according to every mans necessitie. You can not but groane under the heavie burden which is laide upon you. Your land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords do wringe and grinde your faces for the maintenance of their pride in apparell, their excesse in diet, their unnecessa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

and such like vanities. They enhaunce your rents, they take great fines, and do keep you in very unchristian slaverie &amp; bondage. Why do you not seeke for your better releefe to renue the use which was in the Apostles times? These great possessions, lands, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venewes, which the richer sort have in their handes, do (as you see) make them verie proude, choake their zeale, hinder them in their vertuous proceedings, and will in deed (if order be not taken) mar and undo them.</p>

            <p>I have not used a worde of mine owne
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8671:17"/>
heerin, but have been a faithfull relator un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, what the clergie factious do thinke of their lay schollers. And is not then deere brethren the consideration heerof very piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto you? The one sort you see would bring us to the government which was, as they saie, in the Apostles times, but they would have the livings of these times: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sort not caring so much for the said go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, do greatly urge in the ministery the Apostolicall povertie, to the intent that they might obtaine the pray, which they looke for. Wherby I doubt not, but it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest unto you, that covetousnes in them both hath thrust them into this schisme.</p>
            <p>But yet a worde or two more unto you the factious of the laitie. I beseech you upon what groundes do you stand? Your owne teachers seeing your fetches do utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne you; and for mine owne part I do not absolve you. It is therefore very meete and agreeable to the reputation which you desire, either for your vertue or for your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that before you proceed any farther in your disclosed maske, first you provide you of teachers for your warrant therein: least otherwise you growe into hatred, as men for their commodity regarding neither God nor the word.</p>
            <p>Nay in my opinion you ought to be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:8671:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to open your mouthes ever heerafter against the present governement of the Church, and for the newe platforme, untill you can be contented to be so far from co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veting the goods of the church, as that you are both willing and readie to deliver out of your hands such spoiles and praies thereof, as you have alreadie.</p>
            <p>If I were urged, deerly beloved, to give my consent to the erection of these Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which both the sorts of these men do seeme so earnestly to desire, I could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent (so that first they agreed who shoulde have the present revenues of the church) for som short time (until they saw the mischiefe of them) to yeeld therin unto them. Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God graunt unto them and to everie one of us such grace from above, as that we may not wilfully infringe his holy commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, prohibiting us to covet other mens goods: but with all thankefulnes to satisfie our selves with those benefits which of his mercie he hath alreadie bestowed upon us. And thus much of these fower causes why so manie false prophets go out from the church.</p>
            <p>Now followeth the last point of the first <note place="margin">

            <p>It had beene good for the church, that when false prophets wil needs separate them selves from the communion thereof, they would have gone likewise and have dwelt in some strange countries; as <hi>India, Cataia,</hi> or to the farthest parts of <hi>Afrike,</hi> where they might have delighted themselves in all sorts of novelties, and erected such governments as should best have pleased their fansies. But they will none of that: for as <hi>Tertullian</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth; <hi>Illorum opus non proprio aedificio venit, sed ex</hi>

            <p>But indeed if they would be gone to dwel in strange countries: yet they could not be permitted. For (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith) where God doth build his citie, the divel wil have another hard by to confronte it: or as an other writeth; where Christ erecteth his church, the divell in the same church-yarde will have his chappell.

unitie and order, there the divel doth stir up his ministers by waies and meanes secretlie in corners to caste abroad their cockle and darnell of falshood, discorde, and confusion.

But he saw it not to be expedient: for as the apostle saith, by his directions, there must be heresies in the church: and that as the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fathers do note out of the Scriptures for three causes.</p>
            <p>First (as Saint <hi>Paule</hi> saith) that they which <note place="margin">1. Cor. 1<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>haberet etiam &amp; probationem:</hi> That faith by having temptation, might have also proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Secondlie (saith Saint <hi>Augustine)</hi> there must bee heresies, bicause God doth see it <note place="margin">Enchiri<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

more agreeable to his wisdome; <hi>Ex malis bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na elicere quàm nulla esse permittere:</hi> To bring good out of evill, then at all to permit no evill.</p>
            <p>The third reason heerof is this, that men might be driven thereby the rather to labor and search for the finding out of the truth. To that end God permitted the Iebusites to <note place="margin">
                  <add>Josu</add>. 15.</note> dwell with his people, and to the like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <hi>Scipio Nasica</hi> diswaded the league of peace betwixt the Romans and the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians, least thereby the Romans should grow to be slothfull. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> upon the 54. Psalm affirmeth, that the doctrine of the Trinitie was never so fully handled by the church, as when they were driven there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the heresies of <hi>Arrius:</hi> nor of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as when <hi>Novatus</hi> opposed himselfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it: nor of Baptisme, as when the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists labored to confirme their false opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
            <p>And againe, <hi>Multi sensus Scripturarum la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,</hi>

            <p>Seeing then (deerlie beloved) that there are many prophets and of false disposition, which through contempt of ecclesiasticall
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8671:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
governors, through ambition, self-love, and covetousnes have made a great schism in the church, and do continue amongst us for the trial of our faith, the glorie of God, and that we might more carefully search out &amp; hold faste the truth: you see how necessarie this exhortation of the apostle is: <hi>Deerely beloved, beleeve not everie spirit, but trie the spirits whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be of God.</hi> And thus much of the first part.
<q>
                  <l>Trie the spirits whether they be of God.</l>
               </q>

               </note> you therefore conceive me rightly, and do not pervert my meaning. Some forbid the children of GOD to proove any thing.

But neither of them both in a right good sense, do deale therein as they ought to do.

            <p>The Popish false prophets will suffer the <note place="margin">The slei<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> of popi<add>sh</add> rits</note> people to trie nothing, but do teach them wholie to depende upon them: and to that
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:8671:20"/>
purpose they have indeede three notable sleights.</p>
            <p>First they forbid them the reading of the scriptures. And the better to be obeied ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, they will not permit the Scriptures to be translated into their vulgar toong. Whereof it came to passe that the people were so easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie seduced and drawen from Christ to the Pope; from his merits, to the saints and their own merits; from his bloody sacrifice, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by onely sins are remitted, to their most drie and fruitelesse sacrifice; from the spirituall food of his bodie and bloode, unto a carnall and Capernaicall transubstantiation; from the calling upon his name, to the invocation of saints: and from their sure trust and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in his death, to a vaine imagination of the vertue of their masses, pilgrimages, pardons, and I knowe not to what intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble superstition and idolatrie.</p>
            <p>Against this their falshood and very lewd dealing all those places of Scripture may be alledged, wherein we are commaunded to search the Scriptures, <hi>To proove all things, and to hold tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> which is good:</hi> and likewise in this place to try <hi>and examine the spirits whether they be of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the like purpose an infinite number of places out of the ancient fathers may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied (as you may finde them collected togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:8671:20"/>
by doctor <hi>Buckley</hi> in his answer to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine reasons in the Preface of the Remish testament) where they are verie earnest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this point. <hi>That all Christian men should read the Scriptures, buy unto themselves Bibles, and meditate continually upon the word of God: so as thereby their eies might be opened, their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces comforted, their faith nourished, and their hope lifted up to a full assurance of the promises therein contained.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second shift which these false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of the Romish church do use, is this: Now that they perceive the scriptures to be translated into the language almost of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie nation; and that the bookes are now so common in every mans hands, as that with their former devise they are no longer able to cover their nakednes: they labor with all their might to bind us to the fathers, to the councels, &amp; to the church of Rome, protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verie deepely, that we must admit of no other sence of any place of the scriptures, than the Romish church shall be pleased to deliver unto us: according to the saying of <hi>Hosius; Si quis habeat interpretationem ecclesiae Romanae de loco aliquo scripturae, etiamsi nec sciat</hi> 
               <note place="margin">De expr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               </note> 
               <hi>nec intelligat an &amp; quo modo cum scripturae verbis conveniat, tamen habet ipsissimum verbum Dei:</hi> If a man have the exposition of the church of Rome touching any place of scripture,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:8671:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
although he neither know nor understand, whether and how it agreeth with the words of the scripture, yet he hath the very word of God.</p>
            <p>To refell the grossenes of this absurd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, all that is very effectuall which is brought, to proove that the church is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the scriptures. Besides, we saie that the fathers do in manie points dissent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst themselves: and their generall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels have been oftentimes repugnant one to another. But yet we joine with them upon a nearer issue. Where the fathers do all agree togither, we do not dislike them; and for the first fower generall councels we allow and approove them.</p>
            <p>And heerof it commeth to passe, that we do the rather condemne manie points of Poperie, in that they have of later daies bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and taught us sundrie very strange and dangerous opinions: which as they are not to be found in the scriptures; so are they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant as well to the fathers, as to all the foresaid generall councels.</p>
            <p>Whereupon ariseth their third shift. They wil not stick to confesse, that they teach ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie things now which are not to be prooved either by the words of scripture, fathers, or councels. Mary saie they, if the Apostles and fathers had lived in our times they would
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:8671:21"/>
have taught and decreed, as we have done.</p>
            <p>For you must understand (saith Cardinall <note place="margin">Epist. 2 Bohemo<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>To refell these blasphemous assertions, all those authorities of Scripture are verie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall, wherin God is shewed to be immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and his word an everlasting word, and a word of truth. Likewise those sentences of the fathers, wherin they appeale as occasion serveth, to the Scriptures, accounting them as the verie touchstone and rule of all truth. Which coulde not be true, if (as the Papists
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:8671:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
say) they were like a nose of waxe, or a sword of lead, that might be turned as a man list: or like to the Cameleon that changeth his colors according to his seate: or as though the scriptures were to yeeld to the fantasies of men: that as they changed their minds, being by nature mutable: so the scriptures should change the sense &amp; meaning of God, who is not subject to any alteration or change. It were but a deceitfull touchstone that would apply it self unto the goldsmiths pleasure: and he that should trust it, were not unlike oft times for pure gold to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with copper. The Lord open their eies that they may see the grossenes of this their great sinne: or otherwise I can saie nothing farther of them, but that if needs they will be filthie, let them be filthie still.</p>

Now they are caried hither, now thither. They are alwaies learning (as the apostle saith) but do never attaine to the truth.

            <p>They will take upon them to be masters, before they deserve the name of schollers, and to be in the greatest matters of Gods law, judges, being far unmeete to be called to the barre. <hi>Si verbum nacti sunt subito prosili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt,</hi>

            <p>And surely it is a very true doctrine, that when councels and synods being lawfullie assembled and directed with Gods spirit do resolve upon matters in question: that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men should content themselves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall. Neither can I see, now that popery is banished and the truth of christian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (maugre the malice of all sorts of eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies) is godlie planted amongst us, why in these daies we should not attribute as much to the decrees of our learned fathers in their lawfull assemblies, as other men in times

past of as great judgement as we are of, have done.</p>
            <p>Is it not very absurd that we should seeke everie way to discredite them in matters of lesser importance, who have most notablie sealed unto us the verie grounds and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of religion with their blood? Or is it likely that that Church which was able to discerne betwixt truth and falsehood in so great pointes of doctrine being wrapped through continuance of time in so deepe an obscuritie; should be unable to judge of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, forms of praier, decencie, order, edification, and such like circumstaunces of no greater waight? You would not, I thinke, take it in good part, that men should nowe begin to sift and quarrell at the articles of religion, set out and approoved in the yeere 1562. and yet I see no reason why they may not as well do it, as to carpe and controll at such orders, as were then likewise established for order and government.</p>

of our synods and councels; as also for the avoiding of such confusion as <hi>Calvine</hi> hath before mentioned; you shal understand that there is not a reformed church in chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom which doth not in this case require subscription (at the least) of their ministers. <hi>Calvine</hi> refusing to administer the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in Geneva, and to use therein unleave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bread or wafercakes, was compelled to <note place="margin">Bexa in <add>Vit.</add> Calvin.</note> depart the citie, and was not received thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther againe, until he had allowed of the same kinde of bread; <hi>De quo postea restitutus nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam contendendum putavit. minime tamen dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simulans, quid alioqui magis esset probaturus:</hi> Whereof afterwarde being restored, hee thought never meete to contende, not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling in the meane while what other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he rather approoved.</p>
            <p>In Germanie likewise subscription is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired verie streightlie unto the confession of <hi>Augusta,</hi> of al that take degrees in any of their universities, of all that are made mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, &amp; of all that are admitted to any eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall livings: neither is any suffered there to preach, who shall refuse the said subscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. True it is that one <hi>Osiander</hi> a notable heretike (as <hi>Melancton</hi> noteth and I doubt <note place="margin">Melanct.</note> not of his followers) did heerat take many exceptions, greatly inveighing against that order.

            <p>He likewise (as evidently it may be collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) did bitterlie inveigh against such as did subscribe: <hi>Et gloriatur se libertatem retinuisse nec admisissa haec vincula:</hi> And he gloried (saith <hi>Melancthon)</hi> that he had retained his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and not admitted these bonds. <hi>Atque hi clamores in tanta licentia &amp; anarchia hujus tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris, plausibiles sunt apud multos, qui infinitam licentiam sibi sumunt fingendi opiniones, &amp; Phir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronico more labefactandi omnia recte tradita:</hi> And these out cries (as it followeth in the same place) in so great licentiousnes and confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this time are plausible with many, who take to themselves an infinite libertie of coyning newe opinions, and in a Pirroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous sort of the overthrowing of all things which have been rightly determined.</p>
            <p>Howbeit notwithstanding this mislike of what schismatikes soever, that Church to this daie requireth this subscription. And <hi>Melancthon</hi> himselfe by sundrie good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments approoveth the same in his oration

            <p>I might heer adde how in times past Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, Kings, and generallie al Christians subscribed to the Decrees of the Church ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by themselves or by their substitutes: and I would to God the same order were yet observed, especially by our Iustices of peace in England. Peradventure it woulde make them more carefull than they are in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of their othes which they take (as it is reported) when they are admitted unto those roomes: especially concerning the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of such persons, as are complained of unto them, to be common depravers and contemners of the orders of the church. For heerin (I am afraid) they take as great liberty to dispense with themselves, as ever the pope did with any by his fonde and grossest par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons.</p>
            <p>But touching Ecclesiasticall persons it was commaunded about 1270. yeeres ago, that certaine men, having by schisme and heresie devided themselves from the church of God, and rent in sunder by their factions the peace thereof, should not againe be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived or admitted before they had subscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the constitutions of the church.

Thereupon it was againe reviewed, and after published with such approbation, as that it was accounted the worke of God. But yet not long after there were againe, who affirming the same to resemble the Masse booke, <hi>Divisionis occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionem arripiebant:</hi> Did greedily hunt (as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesius</hi> saith) for occasion of division. <hi>Vocabula</hi>

Latin, and requiring M. <hi>Bucers</hi> judgement of it, received this his approbation: That there was nothing therein contained, which was not taken out of the word of God, or at the least which was against it, <hi>Commodè acceptum,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <add>Bu</add>cer.</note> being well understood.

            <p>Vpon this occasion the booke was againe <note place="margin">

            <p>Master <hi>Iohn Oulde</hi> a very learned man writ <note place="margin">
                  <add>I</add>o.

            <p>Doctor <hi>Grindall</hi> late Archbishop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terburie, being there in banishment with <note place="margin">Grindall</note> them, certified Bishop <hi>Ridley</hi> condemned to die, and then in prison in Oxford, of Master <hi>Knoxes</hi> perverse behaviour.

               <hi>Knoxe</hi> could not beare with our booke of Common praier, in matters against which; although I grant a man (as he is) of wit and learning, may finde to make apparant rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, yet I suppose he cannot be able sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the word of God to disproove any thing in it.</p>
            <p>Afterward when it pleased almighty God to blesse this Realme with the happie go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement of our Soveraigne Ladie the Queenes most excellent Majestie that now is (whom almightie God long preserve, with all health and prosperitie to rule &amp; governe us) the saide booke in some points bettered togither with the truth of christian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, established in hir brothers daies, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine through Gods favor and hir goodnes restored unto us.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Heerby you see, deerly belooved, what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count was made of this booke in times past, &amp; that by men neither for life nor learning, to be any way contemned. But now the case is altered: and many are growen to such a hatred of it, as they scarcely have patience to heare the booke once named. <hi>Cranmer, Ridley, Bucer, Peter Martir</hi> with many other, as famous men as ever this lande brought foorth: notwithstanding they imployed their whole times verie diligently and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullie in the studies of Divinitie, and other good learnings therunto appertaining, were compassed about, belike with such thicke clouds and mistes of papable darknes, that they could in a maner see nothing.</p>
            <p>Marie nowe, two or three yeeres studie is as good as twentie. It is woonderfull to see, how some men get perfection. One of fower or five and twentie yeeres old, if you anger him, will sweare he knoweth more then all the ancient fathers. And yet in verie deede, they are so earnest and fierce, that either we
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:8671:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
must beleeve them, or else account their boldnes to be, as it is, most untollerable.</p>
            <p>For they are not afraid, even as hath been saide, with the same faces, that the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies of the holie Ghost were sometimes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led dreames, the doctrine of the Apostles heresie, and our Savior Christ a Samaritane, to publish in their writings, that the foresaid booke so notably approoved, hath in it at <note place="margin">
                  <add>1 A</add>dmonit.</note> the least above 500. errors. That <hi>It is full of corruption, confusion, and prophanation: that the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders therein prescribed are carnall, beggerly, dung, drosse, lowsie, and antichristian.</hi> They saie, <hi>We eate not the Lords supper, but play a pageant of our own, to make the poore feelie soules beleeve they have an English masse: and so put no difference betwixt truth and falsehood, betwixt Christ and antichrist, betwixt God and the divell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If this were true beloved, then had we cause to looke about us: But (God be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) there is no such matter: it is but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, ambition, and selfe-love that decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them: their toongs and pens are their owne, they will write and speake what they list: and yet who shall controll them? Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes in former times looking upon the Scriptures with their eies have condemned them of follie. There was never any thing so exactly written in the worlde, which is not subject to malice &amp; slander. We desire these
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:8671:32"/>
men in as milde &amp; gentle sort as we are able, that they would not deale in this maner.</p>
            <p>The very heathen might teach them better modestie. He that by wresting of lawes esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished (saith one of that crew) doth seeke to pervert their meaning, <hi>Dum sophos esse cupit, fit planè sycophanta:</hi> Whilest he woulde seeme wise, he prooveth in deed a sycophant.</p>
            <p>I have read, that if any thing, fact, writing, lawe or whatsoever may in reasonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction admit two interpretations, the best and the mildest is ever to be received. And the civill lawyers have these rules; <hi>Semper in dubiis benigniora sunt praeferenda:</hi> Alwaies in doubtfull matters the more benigne are to be preferred. <hi>Non op<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

Another saith; <hi>Non sunt rejiciendae leges quae interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one aliqua possunt convenire:</hi> Lawes must not be rejected, which by any reasonable interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation may be reconciled.</p>
            <p>By these and many other the like perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions we labor to withdraw them from their wringing and wresting (with such bitternes) those things in the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion booke: which either they mislike without cause verie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly, or else do pervert upon some false col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection verie extreemely. But nothing will serve them: for now some of them through
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:8671:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a swelling pride of their own conceits (which as it is commonly noted, hath cast them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a kind of frensie) are not afraid to lay this slander upon the church, and upon hir most excellent Majestie, that since hir Highnes raigne, there hath not been in England anie booke of publike praiers, and order for the administration of Sacraments, or any open forme for the outward profession of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, allowed at all hitherto by the lawes of the Realme.</p>
            <p>Another sort likewise there are, that will not give their heads for the washing, who of their goodnes are content to allowe us a booke and forme of publike praier confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by law, but yet in another sort, even for good natures sake, and bicause they would be thankefull to the time, they wholy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne <note place="margin">

For say they, though there were never an evill worde or sentence in all the forme of our praiers, yet to appoint that form to be used, though the words be good, the use is naught. As if a man should saie) if I attaine their meaning) although the words in the Lords praier be good, yet to appoint such a forme of praier, the use it naught.</p>
            <p>Good Lord, if the fathers before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, deerely belooved, were now alive to see their dealings heerein, how every boy, in a maner, doth take upon him (as though he

onely were learned, zealous &amp; wise) to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol, condemne, and to rage thus at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure: surely I suppose they would wish at the least, as <hi>Gregorie Nazianzen</hi> somtime did, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his daies, the like pride and sawcy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepartnes of many.</p>

               <hi>raigneth at this time: and how men by their owne voices, as it were, Vnius diei spatio, do make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves divines, and challenge the commendation of learning and wisedome: Quibus una voluntas ad hoc sufficit ut docti sint, whom their will alone is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to make learned: I cannot choose but wishe with all my hart, with the prophet Ieremie; That I might go and dwell in the wildernes, that so I might leave the societie of men, and give my selfe onelie to contemplation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for you my brethren, I am plainly out of doubt, that if they said not of them, <hi>Vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam abscindatur qui vos perturbant:</hi> I woulde <note place="margin">Gal. 5.</note> to God, they were cut off who thus do trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you: they woulde advise you from the bottome of their harts, to be ruled by the Apostle in this place; <hi>Nolite credere omni spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tui:</hi> Beleeve not these spirits.</p>

of their owne making. I beseech you marke and observe their course taken to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. About fower yeeres since, some two or three private men in a corner framed a booke of the forme of common praier, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration of the Sacraments, &amp;c. And without any authoritie published the same, as meete to be imbraced and used in all the parish churches of England.</p>
            <p>This booke they tolde us was a verie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect book, agreeable to Gods word, and the use of the reformed Churches: and in the end therof, a <hi>proviso</hi> is made in these words: Provided that nothing be done contrary to any order set downe in this booke. The po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie which they have chosen to set in the fore-fronte of their booke, thereby insinuating the excellencie of it, is this. No man can laie any other foundation then that which is laid, even Christ Iesus.</p>
            <p>In this booke they seeme to set downe a breefe sum of christianitie, and the verie ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute forme of ecclesiasticall government: which they saie, Christ hath prescribed onely to be received with the godly in the church. And heer you shall see (my brethren) a verie strange and woonderfull stratageme. For woulde you thinke that in a booke of this nature describing so perfect a platforme of Church governement, the civill magistrate
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:8671:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
should bee quite forgotten? Was there e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver untill this daie anie publike confession set foorth by any true church in the world, since the prophesies were fulfilled (as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith) that Kings and Queenes <note place="margin">August.</note> shoulde bee the fosterers and nurses of the church, where for any supremacy or govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of persons, and in causes ecclesiasticall the civill magistrate is wholie left out? Can there be in a christian common-weale such an absolute order of ecclesiasticall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as they brag of, set downe for the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forme, which is necessarie to be observed without anie mention of the civill magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate? Let this sinke into your harts as it shall please God: what if they had obtained their purpose, for the allowance of this booke? But I will proceed with the historie farther.</p>
            <p>The next yeere another booke of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon praier, &amp;c. with the like authoritie and commendation that the other had, was cast abroad: or you may call it the same booke if you list, so you understand what violence &amp; torments in so tender an age it hath sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The whole forme &amp; order of it, was in a maner changed (they are so constant) and in other places and points of matter, there are not so few as 600. alterations. The wise man speaking of such resolution, saith that <hi>Stul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eccles. <add>27.</add>
               </note>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:8671:35"/>
               <hi>ut Luna mutatur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the last page of this booke for maners sake (as it seemeth) they have remembred the civill magistrate: but that in so cold and sparing a sort, as in my opinion, there is not a priest in Wisbich who will refuse (the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances thereof being considered) to subscribe unto it.</p>
            <p>But to goe forward: Within another yeere a third booke is begotten and brought foorth, differing in some points from both the other: and they have beene very earnest that this should be allowed of by publike authority. Howbeit if you thinke their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be, as they seem to pretend, you are wholy deceived.</p>
            <p>For a simple man would conceive there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that their purpose is, we should have a prescribed and set forme of publike praier to be used from time to time in our severall congregations: so as poore men by often hearing of them might the better know and understand them, and peradventure have them by hart, or at the least be so cunning in them, as that when the minister shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with any praier, understanding before the drift thereof, their harts might fullie concurre with him in every particular sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and with a better resolution in the end say, Amen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:8671:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But in deede they have no such intent: for you must imagine, though (as the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent before mentioned) they have many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications and turnings, yet they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies means and waies to shift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. If they should in deed prescribe unto us a set form of praier, it might be said that though the words were good, yet the use were naught: and therefore you shall find it a generall rule in their Rubrickes, that the minister shall either pray as there it is set downe, or else as the spirite of God shall moove his hart, to that effect, framing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe according to the time and occasion.</p>
            <p>So as you see your selves in this point left to the ministers discretion. If he conceiving a praier upon the sudden, shal after say it was to the same purpose that is prescribed in the booke, you may not controll him.</p>
            <p>And how by such kinde of praiers you are like to be edified, and in what danger you are thereby left, he is of simple judgement that cannot discerne it. A great man and Ringleader in this faction (at the least heer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore so accounted) though otherwise of a giddy disposition and verie uncertaine: yet heerof upon his good experience he writeth upon occasion, after this sort.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Now what worship or praiers do you use? I am <add>ashamed to name the boldnes and follie of some who</add>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:8671:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
scarce able to utter three words orderly, will yet take upon them to bable out a tedious, long and stut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering praier, wherein every tenth worde shall be the repeating of, O heavenly father, O mercifull father, O deere father, O good Lord, O mercifull God, &amp;c. and all things so foolishly packed togither, that their praieng seemeth rather to be the prat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an infant that would tell some great tale but can not hit of it.</hi>
               </q> Thus far the reformer: and yet he saith not all.</p>
            <p>For sometimes they will so wander either by error or malice, in framing their praiers answerable to their affections (which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes malitiously bent against any thing or matter wherewith they are displeased;) that no true christian, if he had time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of their meaning, ought in charitie when they have done, to say, Amen.</p>
            <p>These inconveniences have been long since foreseen, and for the avoiding of them, the church hath ever tied hir ministers in their ordinarie and publike service, unto a prescript and certaine forme of praier.</p>
            <p>About 1200. yeeres ago it was decreed in the councell of <hi>Milevitanum: placuit, ut pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>

               <hi>&amp;c. Quae probatae fuerint in Concilio, ab om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus celebrentur, nec aliae omnino dicantur in ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia nisi quae à Prudentioribus tractatae in Synodo fuerint:</hi> It pleased the councell, that those praiers should be generally used of all men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:8671:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which are approoved in a councell: and that no other should at all be said in the church, but such as have beene sufficiently conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of by wise men, or allowed of in a synod. And the reason which the councell addeth, is most effectual: <hi>Ne forte aliquid contra fidem, vel per ignorantiam, velper minus studium sit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positum:</hi> least peradventure some thing be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered or framed, either through ignorance or want of due consideration, which may be against the rules of faith.</p>
            <p>And therfore deerly belooved, seeing these spirits would draw you from the church, and from those praiers which you knowe to be godlie, and carie you, yea teach you, they knowe not whether nor what themselves, I beseech you beleeve them not.</p>
            <p>Thirdlie they crie out, that the governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">1. Admonit</note> of the church now established in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, is both antichristian and divelish: and that (as I can collect out of their writings) in two respects: First, bicause where we had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Dialog of white divels</note> a spirituall Pope, nowe the civill magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate is made a temporall Pope: which they shew to be far more discommodious to the church, then if they had kept their spirituall Pope still: secondly, bicause bishops in their severall dioceses have a superioritie and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie over the rest of the clergie.</p>

No pettie Popes ought to be maintained or tollerated in any christian common weale: but our Archbishops and Lord-Bishops, &amp;c. therefore, &amp;c. Thus <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> hath reasoned against one part of this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian governement. But why staied he there? Indeede it was time for him to staie. He saith he is a courtier: howbeit I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded there is none there of so undutifull a hart to his soveraigne: For though he cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly would seeme to shew his malice onely against bishops: yet hath he left to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the verie same reasons against the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill magistrate.</p>
            <p>So that upon his principles a man may frame this rebellious argument; No pettie Pope is to be tollerated in a Christian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: But hir Majestie is a pettie Pope: Therefore hir Majestie is not to be tollerated in a Christian common-wealth. And his <hi>Minor</hi> may thus be prooved; Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever doe take upon them, or usurpe the same authoritie in causes ecclesiastical with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their dominions, which the Pope had, they are pettie Popes: But hir Majestie doth so: Therefore hir Majestie is a pettie Pope: and so consequently not to be tollerated in a Christian common-wealth. Now surely if <add>Martin were well examined, he is like to</add>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:8671:37"/>
proove a verie good subject. But for me he must be as he list, seeing neither in respect of God nor his prince he wil be as he shuld be.</p>
            <p>Touching the Bb. as you have heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of <hi>Ierom,</hi> and as Master <hi>Calvin</hi> upon <note place="margin">Inst. lib. 4. cap. 4.</note> his report seemeth to confesse: Bishops have had this authoritie, which <hi>Martin</hi> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ever since the evangelist S. <hi>Marks</hi> time. Besides, in the most flourishing time of the church, that ever happened since the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles daies, either in respect of learning, or of zeale, <hi>Martins</hi> and al his companions opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath heerin been condemned for an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie. Lastly, there is no man living, as I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, able to shewe, where there was anie church pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted ever since the apostles times, but there the Bb. had authoritie over the rest of the ministerie. The place of <hi>Ambrose</hi> will no way serve their turne. But I wil leave this matter, and come to the second part of this their divelish and antichristian governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>When it pleased almightie God to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver this Realme of Englande from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and thraldome of the B. of Rome, it was thought agreeable to the word of God, by the chiefest and best learned men of the religion in all Christendome, that not onely the title of supreme governor over all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and in all causes, as well ecclesiastical
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:8671:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as civill, did appertaine, and ought to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed unto the crowne: but likewise all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, dignities, preeminences, jurisdictions, privileges, authorities, immunities, profits, and commodities, which by usurpation at any time did appertaine to the Pope.</p>
            <p>In this supremacie, these principall points <note place="margin">
                  <add>S</add>upremacy.</note> were contained; that the king hath ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie authoritie in causes ecclesiasticall: that he is the chiefest in the decision and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of church causes: that he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie authoritie for making all lawes, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, and constitutions of the church: that without his authoritie, no such lawes, ceremonies, or constitutions are or ought to be of force: and lastly, that al appellations, which before were made to Rome, should e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be made heerafter to his Majesties chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie to be ended and determined, as the maner now is, by delegates.</p>
            <p>This preeminence and authoritie was greatly impugned by the Pope and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents: but notwithstanding it was so nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly defended by the sundrie writings of rare and speciall men in all gifts of pietie &amp; lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as that hitherto (Gods name be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for it) the truth therein hath notablie prevailed. Amongst manie bookes which have been written to this purpose, you shall finde these very learnedly penned: one <hi>De
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8671:38"/>
vera differentia Regiae potestatis &amp; ecclesiasticae:</hi> another written by Master <hi>Bekinsawe, De su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premo &amp; absoluto Regis imperio:</hi> a thirde, <hi>De vera obedientia,</hi> written by a man at that time in this point well affected. Likewise (as you may read in Master <hi>Foxe) Cutbert Tunstall</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Duresme, and <hi>Iohn Stokeslie</hi> Bishop of London, write a short treatise in forme of a letter to cardinall Poole then resiant in Rome, very effectually compiled to the same effect. Lastly, you cannot but remember with what learning and authoritie this matter hath been defended by Bishop <hi>Iewell</hi> against <hi>Harding,</hi> by Bishop <hi>Horne</hi> against <hi>Fecknam,</hi> by the Deane of Paules against <hi>Dorman,</hi> by doctor <hi>Ackwoorth</hi> (as it is supposed) against <hi>Saunders,</hi> and by divers others, as occasions have been offered by the Papists.</p>
            <p>I am perswaded there was never cause more throughly handled; and the issue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them was ever this, whether the king within his dominions, or the B. of Rome, might by the word of god rightly challenge the foresaid authoritie.</p>
            <p>Marie now a third sort of men are risen up in the world: who do affirme that they al joined upon a wrong issue: and that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie which both sides labored for, doth indeed appertain unto their presbyteries, and ecclesiasticall senates.</p>

               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:8671:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I would be loth deerely beloved, to abuse you with untruthes: and therefore I have thought good to make this matter more <note place="margin">A <add>d</add>eclara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <add>tion.</add>
               </note> plaine unto you by a very manifest example, authorised in a declaration published by the king of Scots.</p>
            <p>About some sixe or seaven yeeres ago (as <note place="margin">
                  <add>Scot</add>land.</note> I do imagine) certaine men of the new go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, intending the erection of these presbyteries in Scotland, began their parts and proceeded as followeth.</p>
            <p>They did greatly inveigh against the supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioritie of Bishops, and likewise repined at the kings authoritie in causes ecclesiasticall: whereupon in his minoritie, a certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ministers gathering to themselves certaine gentlemen, and divers others, did erect by their owne authoritie their ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall senates: and usurping all the whole ecclesiasticall jurisdiction, did alter the lawes at their owne pleasures, without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and approbation, either of the king or state.</p>
            <p>They likewise tooke upon them to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the estate of Bishops, and to declare the same to be unlawfull: directing their commissioners to the king, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him and the counsell, under paine of excommunication never afterwards to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point any more Bishops, bicause they had
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:8671:39"/>
concluded that estate to be unlawfull.</p>
            <p>They prescribed lawes to the king and state, &amp; appointed general fastings through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Realme when they thought good: especially when som factioners in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie were to moove any great enterprise.</p>
            <p>Besides, divers of the ministers having preached very factious and seditious doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and being in that respect called before the king to answer the complaints made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, they utterly disclaimed the kings authoritie, as an incompetent judge, alleaging for themselves, that for such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as were spoken in the pulpit, they ought to be exempt from the judgement and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of princes, denieng his authoritie flatly in causes ecclesiasticall.</p>
            <p>The king giving co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement upon the saterday, to certain noble men for the feast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the embassador of France in Edenbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough the next monday after: a number of the presbyterie understanding thereof: as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled themselves togither on sunday in the morning, &amp; presumptuouslie caused the ministers to proclaime a faste to be held the same monday, and could by no means be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to alter their determination therin. So as whilest the lords &amp; the chiefe of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, according to the kings commandement, were about the intertainment of the embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:8671:40"/>
the ministers one after another all the daie long in their severall sermons were bitterlie inveighing against them: and had it not been for the kings, great importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, they had been all excommunicated.</p>
            <p>But yet another pranke which they plaied passed all these. The king with the advice of his Estates in Parleament, having resolved upon a certaine fact committed by some of his subjects, that it was treason: these men in their assemblie (esteeming their judgement to bee the soveraigne judgement of the Realme) did not onely approove the same fact as lawful, contrary to the said act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leament, but ordained al them to be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, who woulde not subscribe to their determination therein.</p>
            <p>When the king saw what course these men held, and how notwithstanding the equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie they pretended, they sought altogither their owne advancement: how they erected that in themselves, which they had dejected in the Bishops: how they tooke more upon them then ever the Bishops had done: how they did imitate preposterouslie the papall jurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: how under the pretence of their presbyteries, they trod upon his scepter, and labored to establish an ecclesiasticall ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of an infinite jurisdiction, such as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the law of God or man could tollerate:
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:8671:40"/>
and perceiving withall, that the new erected governement was the mother of all faction, confusion, sedition, and rebellion: that it was an introduction to Anabaptisme and popularitie: that it tended to the overthrow of his state and Realme, and to the decaie of his crown: and that he must either discharge himselfe of the crowne, or the ministerie of that forme of government, by the consent &amp; act of Parliament, 1584. he overthrew their presbyteries, and restored the Bishops again to their places. All this you may finde more at large set down by the king himselfe in his said declaration.</p>
            <p>It may heer be said (for they dare say what they list) that nowe the king is of another minde: and that this declaration was made when he had conceived some displeasure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them.</p>
            <p>For the king, he is not altred. <hi>Ictus piscator sapit.</hi> His crowne and their soveraigntie will not agree togither. And what cause he had to proceed against them as he did, although it be great boldnes in such a case, not to rest satisfied in the worde of such a king: yet for your better understanding, what to thinke of this kinde of government (for never a barrell will proove the better herring) you shall heare the opinion of one of our owne countrie-men, who was in Scotland about
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:8671:41"/>
the same time, and observed verie diligentlie the woonderfull pride and insolencie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I judge</hi> saith he (writing of this Parlea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment now assembled) <hi>that if the Parleament should establish such names, and those the officers according to those names which seeke their owne discipline, that then in steede of one Pope we shoulde have a 1000. and of some lord Bishops in name a 1000. Lordlie tyrants in deed, which nowe do dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine the names. This I have found by experience to be true: I can testifie by triall of Scotland, which have travelled it over in their best reformed pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: as in Doude, Saint Andrewes, Edenborough, &amp; sundrie other townes: and have knowen the king in great danger, and feare of his life by their lordlie discipline, &amp;c.</hi> And againe: <hi>I have seen all maner of wickednes to abounde much more in their best places in Scotland, then in our woorser places heere in England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore it may please you brethren to heare the same mans judgement of such, as do labor so busily in this matter: in a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise of his against one <hi>Barowe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereas you charge us</hi> (saith he) <hi>in denieng Christ in his offices, and consequently not to be come in the flesh: it shall appeere by your presbyterie or eldermen, that indeede you are and will be the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen even to pull the most ancient of all, Christ Iesus himselfe by the beard: yea and seeke not onely
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:8671:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to shake him by the lockes of his haire out of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, but also all his ancients under him, I meane the lawfull magistrates and ministers, which have lawfull authoritie from him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wherefore not we but you rather seeke the glis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering blase of great name: and if once you might get up the names of Elders and Presbyters, what mischiefe, crueltie, and pride would not streame from that name, even as fire from a blasing star to set on fire the whole worlde? For every busie foole, the more busie he were in discrediting others, and seeking mastership among the people, the better el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he should be judged. Yea and this new name of an elder given him, were even as a sacrament of grace, and woulde seale up all his knaverie: that whatsoever filthines dropped from him, yet the skirte of his ancients gowne should cover it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This mans opinion heerin I know will be greatly contemned, bicause I thinke he hath bin of another judgement. But yet they may give him leave to speake, as his experience (which is no foolish master) hath taught him. For commonly it comes to passe, when rash men run hedlong into any new devises, that <hi>Posteriores cogitationes solent esse sapientio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res:</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Cice<add>ro.</add>
               </note> their after wits are best. How beit let him finde what favour at their hands he shall. I must indeed confesse, that if this matter had onely depended upon his report, or opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I would not at this time have made men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:8671:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of him. But it is far otherwise. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede if their proceedings be better consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that which he hath saide, either of his judgement touching their presbyteries, or of his experience in Scotlande concerning their practises, and that even against the king it is in a maner nothing.</p>
            <p>I beseech you brethren, especially you that have beene brought up in learning, and are able to looke into this cause, do but consider how the cheefe magistrates have beene used and dealt withall, wheresoever this absolute government which they speak of, hath been erected. Reade the writings of the chiefest pillers of these platformes, as the booke <hi>De jure magistratuum in subditos:</hi> the booke inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled <hi>Vindiciae contra tyrannos:</hi> another <hi>De jure regni apud Scotos:</hi> The dialogs of <hi>Eusebius Philadelphus,</hi> with sundry other of that sort: and you shal find in them these most strange and rebellious propositions stiflie maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, dilated and amplified.</p>

            <p>I dare avowe it unto you brethren, and I thinke no man will make exception against it: that if all were laide before you that the Popes have done against Princes: it is not more then these men defend may be put in execution when they thinke good by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and the people.</p>
            <p>I might make this thing verie plaine unto you by divers particular examples, which they greatly allow and propound to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for their imitation: were it not that the very naming of them would grow offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive unto you all. Onely in generalitie it may please you to understand what is written to this purpose in a booke printed at <hi>Geneva,</hi> &amp; compiled by three or foure whose names I know not. <hi>Although</hi> (say they) <hi>The Popes for sundry enormities have deposed princes by their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull authority, yet the reason that mooved them so to do was honest and just, and meete to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and executed by the bodie or state of every common wealth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any do heer object, that I stand too long upon this matter, considering that
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:8671:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
these things do touch mens dealings and writings in other countries, and cannot in any sort be applied to our reformers in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: my answer is, that I wish from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of my hart it were so, but I greatly feare, by that which already is done, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there be in time verie good order ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, it will fall out far otherwise.</p>
            <p>For it seemeth to me, that whatsoever hath bin done heerin abroad, is labored for to be put in execution heer with us at hom.

               <hi>come to passe</hi> (saith he to the Bb.) <hi>by that means which will make your harts to ake, blame your selves. Martin</hi> in his first booke threateneth <hi>Fists:</hi> and in his seconde, he wisheth that our Parleament, which is now assembled, would put downe Lord Bishops, and bring in the reformation which they looke for, whether hir Majestie will or no. Let the place be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, whether I have attained to his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Surely whilest he talketh much of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, I feare he wil be found a traitor himself.</p>
            <p>For how can he conceive that such a thing should be brought to passe (if hir majesty do hir best to withstande it) without a rebellion at the least, that I may go no farther. Hath not hir highnes in making of lawes a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive voice? Is not <hi>Lex principis opus?</hi> hath not every law <hi>Vim cogentem</hi> of the king?</p>
            <p>I assure you (my brethren) these are despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate points to be stoode in. And I do verilie feare, that except good order be taken, and <add>that in time, these things will grow to some</add>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:8671:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
extremities. For seeing these spirits of ours do follow so exactly, and with such hot pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite, the outlandish precepts, touching the forme of their new governement, is it not to be provided for, least they fall to the outlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish meanes likewise (mentioned before in their traiterous propositions) for the erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and establishing thereof?</p>
            <p>I was enformed by a magistrate of right good worship, that a preacher of this facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the presence of certaine Iustices of the peace, and in a verie great congregation did without controlment, convention, or bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over either to sessions or assises, set on broch the doctrine of the former propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for violent reformation.</p>
            <p>He greatly complained of the manifolde imperfections, wherewithall (as he said) the church of England was greevously oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: and laboured verie earnestly to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade his auditorie, that in France it was lawfull for the people or inferiour magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, to compel their prince to a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any such deformities: or else whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would or no to do it themselves. As though he should have said: if by the word of God it be lawfull in France, it is likewise lawfull in England: the dutie of subjects to their kings in that respect being one in <add>both.</add>

If these things deerely beloved, which I have reported unto you (in sort as I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted upon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) be not true, let me be called to mine answer: but if they be true, then I trust you will confesse the necessitie of this exhortation (so far as concerneth your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) which heer the Apostle maketh: <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rissimi nolite omni spiritui credere.</hi> Take heed of such spirits least they seduce you, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve them not.</p>
            <p>Saint <hi>Paule</hi> in his epistle to <hi>Titus</hi> doth straightlie in him commande us, that after <note place="margin">Cap. 3 An exh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">

               </note> one or two admonitions, we should avoide the companie of an heretike. Vpon which place some learned men do observe, that the Apostles doctrine there appertaineth but unto private men. For saie they, if he had written the same to civill magistrates, he would have bidden them after one or two admonitions, to have punished with due severitie all such kinde of persons. And even so saie I touching this place. The apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth you that be private men, that you beleeve not everie spirit, but concerning you that be magistrates, I am assured the apostolicall doctrine doth commande you, that by your authoritie you carefullie inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to suppresse such spirits. <hi>Martin</hi> affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Bishops are in fault, that there are so manie schismes this daie amongst us,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:8671:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and I confesse, I am my selfe in some part of his opinion. But yet no farther, then the same reprehension is to be extended gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally unto all other magistrats.</p>

            <p>Saint <hi>Basill</hi> in his time finding the like jars, and disorder that we have now amongst us: how (as it is in the booke of Iudges) everie man did even what he list himselfe, he saith, he perceived this was the cause: for that (as it is there noted) in those daies there was no king in Israel, that is, God was not regarded, or as it may truly be saide, the magistrats did not their duties. For there is no great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt having none at al, and having of such as do neglect the charge which is committed unto them.</p>
            <p>Nay surely mine opinion is, that if there were not some, (whether Bishops or men of as great or greater authoritie) that doe in some sort favor these spirits, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have growen either in number so manie, or in their dealings to have been so violent.</p>
            <p>That which Master <hi>Calvine</hi> writeth, may <note place="margin">Epist. 171.</note> verie fitlie be applied to this purpose: <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini verbum facere in mentem veniret, nisi quis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiliae hominum viderent se proceribus officium praestare, ac paratam sibi esse maledicentiae mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedem: subitóque evanescerent mendacia, nisi ab eisdem illis in quorum gratiam conficta sunt, foverentur:</hi> None woulde ever have ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

their mouthes in this sort, except the base and rascall sort of men had seene that thereby they shoulde gratifie some men in authority, and were to be rewarded: for their evill speaking and lies would soone have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if they were not nourished by those, for whose pleasure they were published.</p>
            <p>Be it that hitherto you have been mooved to spare them with their great shew of zeale. <note place="margin">Ad Q. <add>fra</add>trem.</note> For as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith: <hi>Vt quisque est vir optimus, ita difficillimè esse alios improbos suspicatur:</hi> The best men, do least of all suspect others to be evill. Yet now that you see into how despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and dangerous a course they are fallen, your farther bearing with them will not be well excused.

I may never behold the miseries and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which of necessitie thereby must fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the church. He exhorteth the magistrats that they would more diligently looke unto their duties then before time they had done. <hi>Cur enim unicuique quicquid lubet scribere, &amp; in quemvis pro sua libidine debacchari, eaque ratione ecclesias perdere permittitur?</hi> For why is everie one suffered (saith he) to write what he liste, and to raile upon everie man at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and so by that meanes to destroie the church?</p>
            <p>Naie surely if you looke not to this geare in time, this judgement doth but begin at the house of God, and it will proceede far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the overthrowe of all government. God of his infinit mercy open your eies that you may see these dangers, and grant you both grace and courage, that you may in due time prevent them.</p>
            <p>And nowe unto you all deerely belooved, <note place="margin">To the <add>peo</add>ple.</note> who having no authoritie to represse these spirits, must carefully looke about you, that you be not deceived: I beseech you with the apostle, Do not beleeve them.</p>
            <p>The doctrine of the church of England, is pure and holie: the government thereof, both in respect of hir majestie, and of our Bishops is lawfull and godlie: the booke of common praier containeth nothing in it

contrarie to the word of God.</p>
            <p>All these points have been notably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooved and maintained not onely against the Papists, but likewise against some other schismatikes, and you your selves with great joy and comfort have in time past imbraced them accordingly.

            <p>They wil furthermore (the better to creep into your harts) pretend great humilitie, and bitterly exclaime against the pride of Bb. as though they affected nothing else by their desired equalitie, but some great low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, and to prostrate themselves at your feet for your service: whereas in deed they shoote at greater superioritie and preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

challenge unto them: and would no doubt tyrannise by their censures over both prince and people at their pleasure, in most untol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable and popelike maner. As partly you may gather by the premisses, and partlie fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore understand in that not onely they do use the verie same arguments for the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne authoritie of their presbyteries (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the prince) in causes ecclesiasticall: that the Pope doth for his principalitie in the same (and none other so far as I can read, or I thinke can be shewed by any:) but do likewise make to all our arguments for hir majesties supremacie against them, the very same answers, (if not word for worde, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in effect) that <hi>Harding, Stapleton, Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and <hi>Saunders</hi> have made to the same ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, used by Bishop <hi>Iewell,</hi> Bishop, <hi>Horn,</hi> Master <hi>Nowell</hi> and others to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and against the Pope. I cannot stande to enter into any particular examples of this matter, onely I thought it necessarie at this time to advertise you of it (take his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage thereof who list) that you might the better beware of such kind of spirits.</p>
            <p>You have heard them, I am sure, greatly exclaime against our Bb. livings, as though they had too much, therby to perswade you with what simple allowance they could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:8671:50"/>
they reckon all the livings of the church too litle for themselves: condemning you of the laitie, who either have or would have part with them, for cormorants, <hi>Dionysians,</hi> and for such wicked traitors against the church, as <hi>Iudas</hi> was against Christ.</p>

            </p>
            <p>If they set foorth a booke of common praiers, then caution is made that nothing be done contrarie to any thing set downe in the same. If they decree any thing in their synods (yea though it be in civill matters) against an act of Parleament, that treason is not treason, yet if you withstand them, you are foorthwith accursed: or as touching church causes, except it should so fall out, that they do erre in their determinations, and that in some great matter of faith, all men must stand unto their orders, decrees lawes and constitutions,.</p>

            <p>They sift, they search, and condemne at their pleasure. This is too much, that is too little: this is too long, that is too short: this is idolatrous, that is superstitious: this is wanting, that is superfluous: this is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, <note place="margin">

the interpretations of all the ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who ever lived, yet we must beleeve them (as <hi>Hosius</hi> spake of the church of Rome) that what they saie, it is the verie word of God.</p>
            <p>If they alledge unto us the authorities of fathers and councels, to proove the equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ministers, the authoritie of their laie governors, &amp; the continuance of their pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries since the Apostles times: though therein they pervert them all most grossely, (&amp; I feare of purpose to deceive you my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, even against their owne consciences, and contrary to the expresse meaning of the said fathers and councels, even in those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which they bring and infinte others:) yet they will face out the matter with verie strange boldnes, &amp; be more then offended that any should examine or seem to mistrust them. I could bring you divers examples heerof, but one of ech sort shall suffice.</p>
            <p>To proove the equalitie which they saie ought to be in the ministers of the worde <note place="margin">T.

word and sacraments) was a Bishop: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the whole course of their writings the contrarie is most manifest: never man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides themselves (to my understanding) did so expound them: the ecclesiasticall histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries report of those times otherwise, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in lesse then an hundreth yeeres after <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> and either before or in <hi>Ambrose</hi> daies, it was condemned as an heresie, for any to hold that opinion.</p>
            <p>Againe to proove the authoritie of their <note place="margin">

               </note> Aldermen, (which do neither preach nor administer the sacraments) with the use and practise thereof in everie church long after the apostles times, they alledge certain pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces out of <hi>Ignatius, Tertullian, Hierome,</hi> &amp;c. where mention is made of priesthood, of colledges, counsailes, and companies of priests, that joined with the Bishops for the better governement of the church, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of certaine particular duties.</p>
            <p>Whereas besides that Master <hi>Calvin</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe writing of the state of the church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after the Apostles daies confesseth, that those priests were ministers of the word and sacraments: <hi>Habebant singulae civitates</hi>

            <p>But of all other in my opinion the last example appertaining to this purpose is most notable. For the better understanding whereof, you must know that the church of God ever since the apostles times, hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed the ecclesiasticall ministerie prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipallie into these three parts, Bishops, Priests, and Deacons: according as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the apology of the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: <hi>Credimus, varios in ecclesia esse ordines</hi>

            <p>This division our new reformers with one
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:8671:53" rendition="simple:additions"/>
consent do allow, for the very platforme of their desired government: But their exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parts therof, is agreeable to that which is before observed of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: even co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the profession which hitherto we have made to all the world, and contrarie to the testimonies of al antiquitie.

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:8671:53"/>
the councell of Nice.</p>
            <p>But you shall heare this skilfull man in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories, howe he applieth the authoritie of <hi>Eusebius.</hi> It is manifest (saith he) that the churches were governed under him (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Constantinus)</hi> as before, by Bishops, El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Deacons; by that which is cited of <hi>An infinite number of Elders, and Deacons, which came to the councell of Nice, with the two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth and fiftie Bishops.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heer you see how gladly this fellow would have you to beleeve, that this their governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment so earnestly now sought for, did most of al florish about the time of the councel of Nice, that then there was no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Bishop and a minister of the worde, but were both of them, of equall authoritie, and that then their laie Elders had their consistorie with the rest of their compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in every parish.</p>
            <p>Whereas all the world knoweth, that <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi> meaneth nothing els in that place, but to signify the great appeerance, from all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of the clergie men, of all sorts, in that most honorable synod. And it is likewise ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant by the sixt Canon of the saide Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, that long before that time, Bishops had verie large jurisdictions: as the Bishop of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria is saide according to an olde cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, to have authoritie or power over all
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:8671:54"/>
Egypt and Pentapolie.</p>
            <p>Nay it is manifest by the historie of those, and the former times, that as at the first for the repressing of schismes, Bishops had au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie given them over the rest of the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, so upon good experience and long proofe, that the Bishops being manie in number, did growe themselves likewise at some jarres; it seemed good unto that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, with the emperors consent, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter government of them in like maner, to devide the whole body of Christendome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fower Patriarckships: whereof the first was Rome, which had authoritie over <hi>Italy</hi> and other churches of the west: The second <hi>Alexandria:</hi> which had confirmed unto it the old jurisdiction before mentioned: The third <hi>Antioch:</hi> which was over <hi>Syria:</hi> and the fourth <hi>Ierusalum,</hi> that ruled the churches in <hi>Iurie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So as he that should dreame of any such presbyteries in <hi>Constantines</hi> time, as our new men talke of: must either be very much distempered, verie ignorant or verie maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. This I am sure of, that men of such a faculty, can never want authority to proove what they list. And therefore as I said, so I saie againe my brethren, that if they shall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any of the said ancient fathers, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels or histories to proove the equalitie of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:8671:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ministers, the government of their Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the continuance of their presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries since the Apostles times, they alwaies abuse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selves, falsifie their authors, &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to deceive their readers &amp; hearers: I beseech you deerly beloved, beleeve the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not.</p>
            <p>I might heere likewise put you in minde, how these prophets, who seeke to withdraw you from the church established, are rent in sunder, and divided amongst themselves. They have written bookes one against ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and do most bitterly condemne the dooings and proceedings one of another. You (saith one sort of them) in that you se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate your selves from the publike assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies in England, are growen to become plaine Donatists and heretikes: you (saith the other) in that you having laid the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations whereupon we stand, and yet do joine your selves with them, are become meere hypocrites and apostataes: it had been better for you never to have knowen the truth, than by such your dealings so to have betraied it.</p>
            <p>Do you see these things (deerly beloved) and will you not eschew them? Will you give your selves over to an unbridled course, the end whereof you know not? Shall men of such inconstancy lead you from the truth, and make <add>you to</add> imbrace those things,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:8671:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which you know to have been condemned with one consent by all the ancient fathers for heresies? If you will needes affect them still, bicause you have no stay of your selves; yet let me, I beseech you, prevaile thus much with you, that untill, at the least, they agree amongst themselves, you will be content to give over any longer to follow them.</p>
            <p>In so doing, I doubt not, but you shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to your old love of the truth, imbrace with your former joies this your present re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation (which your neighbors adjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning would thinke themselves most happie to attaine:) and with all sobrietie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, willingly and obediently submit your selves to obey these and the like exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, penned by the holy Ghost, and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to persuade you to perseverance in that godly doctrine which you have received. <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut accepistis Iesum Christum Dominum, ita in</hi>
