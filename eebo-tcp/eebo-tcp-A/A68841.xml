         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<hi>Temperament</hi> is either generall or ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all;

ſpeciall, then when the Elements are
proportioned as euery kind doth require,
be it man, beaſt, or plant. To theſe you

               <p>If Piſmires offend you, take the roots
of Gentian, &amp; boyle them to a decocttion,
and therewith ſprinckle the places where
you ſee them begin to build or reſort, and
they will be deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>Where ſnailes are offenſiue, whether
they bee blacke or gray, take the corrupt
dregges of the ſtrongeſt Traine oyle, and
mixe it with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aſhes of holly bark burnt,
&amp; ſprinckle it about or vpon your corne,
and no ſnaile will come neare it; and yet
the graine will be the better, and the ſoyle
the fatter.</p>
               <p>As for wormes, if they trouble your
corne, the firſt and chiefeſt preuention,
is to Summer-ſtirre your land in the
greateſt drouth or drieſt ſeaſon you can
finde in the ſummer; &amp; though the ground
be neuer ſo hard, rather aduenture your
plow breaking, then the abſtaining from
that order; for it both kils worms, wéeds,
and thiſtles. Or if not this, then take the
<pb facs="tcp:19738:15"/>
in néede of further helpe, then take Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke
and Mercury ſublimate, and ſew it
cloſe and faſt in a leather bagge, and hang
it in or elſe near your garner, and no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
will at any time approach it.</p>
               <p>Oyle lees ſprinckled on corne will do
the ſame, ſo will the pouder of chaulke,
dried Wormwood, the earth of <hi>Olinthus,</hi>
or <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> or the dried leaues of Yewe
or Cypreſſe; laſtly vinegar, and <hi>Lacerpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>
mixt and ſprinckled in a moderate
manner, infinitely preſerueth all manner
of pulſe whatſoeuer.</p>
               <p>As for veſſells to keepe graine in long
and without putrifaction, your ſalt fiſh
barrels inwardly well dawbed with pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
is the beſt, or pitched barrels ſprinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with vinegar; ſo are Oyle barrels
dried and dawbed as afore-ſaid, or for
want of plaſter to dawb them with pitch
and ſope aſhes, or lime vinegar and ſope
aſhes. Laſtly, the dry hutch, cheſt, or bing

will keep corne an hundred yeeres with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
putrifaction: and where they are not
to be got, there if the ſoyle be dry &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
