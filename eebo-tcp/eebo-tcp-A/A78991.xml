            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>VHen a generall Faſt was firſt propounded unto Vs, in contemplation of the miſeries of Our Kingdome of <hi>Ireland,</hi> We readily gave Our Conſent unto it, and in Our Court, and in Our Perſon have duely obſerved it, as a Religious duty, fit to be exerciſed in a time of common Calamity. But when VVe have ſeen what ill uſe hath been made of thoſe publicke meetings under the pretence of Religion, in Pulpits, and Prayers and Sermons of many ſeditious Lecturers to ſtir up and continue the Rebellion raiſed againſt Vs within this Kingdome; And that thoſe who firſt moved and ſeemed to affect the reliefe of Our diſtreſſed Subjects of <hi>Ireland,</hi> have deſerted the care thereof, and diverted the Meanes ordained for the ſupport and preſervation of that Kingdome, to the deſtruction of Vs and of this Kingdome of <hi>England:</hi> VVe have thought it fit to Command that ſuch an Hypocriticall Faſt, to the diſhonour of God, and the ſlander of true Religion be no longer continued and countenanced by Our Authority, which hath been too long continued already, to ſuch falſe and Traiterous ends. And yet VVe being deſirous (as by Our duty to Almighty God VVe are bound) by all poſſible meanes to expreſſe Our own Humiliation, and the Humiliation of Our People, for Our owne ſins, and the ſins of this Nation, (as VVe have great cauſe) are reſolved to continue a Monthly Faſt, but not on the day formerly appointed and ſo much abuſed by thoſe who are in Rebellion againſt Vs, by uſing it as a principall Engine to their owne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes. VVe doe therefore hereby Command, that from henceforth no Faſts, or publicke Meetings under that name be held on the laſt VVedneſday of the Monerh in any part of this Our Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> as for many Moneths it hath been, nor upon any other day, then as hereby is appointed by Vs, which VVe are well aſſured, none of Our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may or ought to doe without, much leſſe againſt Our Command: but inſtead thereof VVe doe expreſly Charge and Command, That in all Churches and Chappells in all parts of this Our Kingdome of <hi>England</hi> and Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> there be a ſolemne Faſt held, and Religiouſly obſerved on the ſecond Friday in every Moneth, with publicke Prayers to God, and Preaching in all places where it may be had, when and where we may all both Prince and People as one man, earneſtly powre out Our Prayers to God, for the diverting of his heavy judgements from Vs, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing of his Gracious <hi>Protection</hi> over Vs and this Nation, for the avoyding of all Malitious practices againſt Vs, and the ſetling and eſtabliſhing of a happy Peace amongſt us. And to the end that with one heart and voice we may performe ſo Religious an Exerciſe, we have cauſed devout formes of Prayers to be Compoſed and Printed, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to diſperſe them into all the parts of this Our Kingdome, and doe Command that they be uſed in all Churches and Chappells at the ſolemne and publicke meetings. And if thus we ſhall heartily and unfainedly apply Our ſelves to Our good God and Gracious Father, whom we have offended, and praiſe him for his many and even miraculous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances paſt, we may with Comfort and Confidence hope that he will in mercy looke upon Vs, and be reconciled unto Vs.</p>
