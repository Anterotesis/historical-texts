            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

fights against
Vanity is justly
yours, because you
have overcome it; we sight
against it in words, you
overcome it in actions; acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
so much better than
words, as health is better
than Physick, and Victory
than the Battell. Your name
alone in the front of my
<pb facs="tcp:40891:6"/>
Book shal give me my lesson,
for if I will paint out Vices
with my pen, your life is a
pattern of opposite Vertues:
Nay to speak truly, you teach
me what to write, for when
I would picture out vices, I
set before me the contrary of
that which I behold and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire
in you, To have often
the word of God in your
hand, but more often in your
mouth; To be dayly praying;
To be adorned with modesty
without art; To open the
hand to the afflicted, and
shut the ear against vices;
To be freely religious with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
scruple (which makes
Christian wisdom affected
austerity) are vertues which
<pb facs="tcp:40891:6"/>
the greatness of your family
makes more remarkable,
and the corruption of this
age more admirable; an
age wherein vices are man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
wherein prophane
vanity and vilany become
Nature, and turn into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion;
amidst all this
darkness you shine as a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
in the night. I know well
your modesty likes not this
discourse, but the publique
utility requires it, that all
may know what esteem we
make of vertue, and that
vices which come up of
themselves, and grow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
watering, may find ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
from you either to
amend or condemne them;
<pb facs="tcp:40891:7"/>
this is also an honour to us,
that the sacred seed which
we sow falls upon so good a
ground, and proves so fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and that there are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
among us, shewing
the difference btwixt true
Godliness, and that super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious
devotion which
thinks to amuse God with
gestures, and binds it self
strictly to certain numbers
of reiterated words, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
Religion to the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
end.</p>
            <p>Having now <hi>Madam</hi> so
many just causes to present
this book unto you, yet I
durst never undertake it,
had not you commanded it.
I am not stuffed with orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb facs="tcp:40891:7"/>
according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stastfull
humour of this age;
I cannot ruffle it out in
swelling termes, and full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blown
bubbles of words, which
are for none but brave spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits;
I cannot talk of <hi>Barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadoes</hi>
of vices, or <hi>Scala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does</hi>

Iesus Christ the <hi>Daulphin</hi>
of heaven;<note place="margin">As Father <hi>Cotton</hi> in his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</note> I do not compose
prayers upon a Fan or a
Nosegay; I am content to
speak French, and aym at
nothing but to be understood,
and in deciphring vices to
plant in mens minds the
contempt of the World, and
the love of God; in low
tearms I discourse of high
matters, and paint out light
<pb facs="tcp:40891:8"/>
with a coale; a fault which
partly may be imputed to
mine own dullness, partly
to my tossed and troubled
condition; It is not easy to
study among gunshot, nor to
mount the spirits high, when
a thousand things interpose
and pluck them down again
and stop their flight: But
the same your goodness
which moved you to perswade
me to write, will perswade
you to bear with my imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,

snatcheth away some part
of our life; No time is ours
but that which we steal from
our selves, robbing some hours
to examine our selves a-part,
and confer with God; there
is work enough to be found
in these solitary Meditations:
But the first work to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
of is the vanity and
misery of our life, not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex

us to leave it: None aspires
as he ought to the life to
come, but he that despiseth
the present. None despiseth
the present, but he that hath
throughly known it; None
can throughly know it, but by
beholding it a far off, and
by withdrawing the heart,
and removing the affections
aside; for worldly pleasures
nigh at hand dazle &amp; distract
the judgement.</p>

Now if we would enquire

            <p>This great Prince, who had
riches without parallell, peace
without trouble, honour
without envy; who was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed
of his Subjects, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of his Neighbours; whose
reign of 80 years gave him
full scope to satisfie his mind
in buildings, in multitude of

written of Plants from the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar

he had done, considering
how much these sweets were

stedfastness in all these things,
how small contentment in all
this travail, concludes thus

            <p>

               <head>Vanity in the Nature of
Man.</head>
               <p>First,<note place="margin">Birth.</note> To take Man from
his beginning, the Noblest
of all Men (be he the Sonne
of an Emperour) is formed
betwixt the Vrine and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure,
nourished with the
most impure bloud of all,
might easily be crushed by
the least fall of the Mother,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40891:12"/>
or smoothered with the stink
of a candle snuff.</p>
               <p>His Birth is shamefull, for
no woman would be openly
delivered; on the other side
it is a glory to kill a man, and
Duels bring men into reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Thus it is a shame to
bring a Man into the world,
and a glory to send him out;
a plain proof that the life of
a Man is an <hi>evill,</hi> since it is a
shame to give it, and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to take it away.</p>
               <p>We see also he begins his
life with tears, and when he
is born he cannot help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
but crawles for some
years in his own filth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
other creatures as soon as
they come forth fall upon
their feet, and run after their
food as soon as they are out of
the shell, Man is born under
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40891:12"/>
the necessity of maintaining
his life with the sweat of his
brows, when all other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
find their cloath laid;
onely man hath need of clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
He that is Lord of all
the World is ashamed to
be seen, and therefore clads
himself in the spoyl of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Man alone is subject to
more diseases than all the
Beasts together; they are
not hurt with <hi>Dewes,</hi> nor
bleed at the Nose, though
they hang it alwayes down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
to the ground, they
know not what Rheumes
mean, the <hi>Stone, Tertian,</hi>
or <hi>Quotidian</hi> Agues; Man
onely knowes these diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
and feels them: those
Beasts that are more domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
are more diseasefull
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40891:13"/>
than others, as infected by
Contagion.</p>
               <p>Man indeed hath Reason
above Beasts, but he devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
therewith how to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
himself, and strains the
uttermost of his wit about
painfull and pernicious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
to be subtill in sutes
of Law, to entangle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in other mens business,
when he is glutted and full,
to raise up an artificiall sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
and a desire to drink,
without thirst; and I know
not how it comes to pass, but
we are more sensible of Evill
than Good, and troubles
fret us more than all plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
can content us: scarce
any one finds a generall
health, but ach in the teeth,
or pain in the fingers end
torments us; a drop of gall
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:40891:13"/>
bitters a sea of sweet, and
how much hapiness doth one

how long and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

end of all this travel, who sees
not a froward humor, and a
despightfull perversity; and
in a Child all the vices of a

the onely way to quiet a

him: if any touch but

the rest for anger; the

such are the Children of the

which hide their bitter under

               <p>Godliness cannot live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
so dainty a dominion;
the knowledge of God (which
comes from Heaven) will
not be subject to the Belly,

               <p>These Evils make men ever

upon the future; alwayes
travelling to get a good,

               <p>There are many men who
hazard their life to get their

obtain the Means, as he that
sells his Sword to buy a Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berd,
or his Horse for Hay,
and again, to get money, and
not therwith to serve his turn,
but rather to serve his money;
to have Goods as one hath
an Ague, which rather gets

like the Dogg in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger

who live poor to die rich, who
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40891:16"/>
covet most when they are
most in years, that is, make
greatest provision when they
are at the end of their journy:
He that fears God to disman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

will consider with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
what the price &amp; valew of

The Devil offers these,
but he never offers Piety, or
the knowledge of God; God
shewes what account he
makes of Riches, when he
gives them most abundantly
to the Wicked, into whose
bosome they fall, as a Purse in
to a privy. Our Saviour shews
what account he made of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
when he gave <hi>Iudas</hi> his

he gave his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
had he thought riches
the true Good, sure he would

have provided enough for
himself; but he had not where
to rest his head; he honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
poverty by his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
and the Lord &amp; So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign

have nothing in the World, to

                  <hi>Godliness is great gain
if a man be content with that he
hath; Naked we came into the

out.</hi> Quiet poverty, is better
than troublesome Riches, yet
such is the silly nature of
man, that he had rather
fetch water from a raging
and violent stream, with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
and perill, than from a
small Brook or rivulet with
ease and safety; To get a mass
of money with danger and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:40891:17"/>
disquiet, rather than a small
summe with peace and secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
and at the end, he shall
be nothing the more satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
nay still further off, and
thinks all is lost that he gets
not; and this greediness is
alwayes mixed with Envy; If
he happen to lose his goods
(as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Riches ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

it is as much as if he
lost his sences; for to rob and
spoyl a covetous man, is as it
were to flea him; and to take
away his money, is to pluck
out his heart, because he sets
his heart all upon his money.
The Godly man when he

<hi>Vanity</hi> displayes it self most,
because many of those Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
are but Vices Brats:
<hi>Choler</hi> whets on Valour;
<hi>Cowardise</hi> makes a Man ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised

Avarice,</hi> and <hi>Envy,</hi> are spurs
to Study and Industry; fear

makes many Women Chast;

others, necessity;
friendships are contracted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

whereof the first is
a Frippery, the last a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket.</p>
               <p>Religion it self is often used
to serve our covetousness;
many follow <hi>Christ</hi> in the
<hi>Wilderness</hi> for bread, this is to
make the Vnderstanding a
slave to the Belly, and the
Prince and Commander of all
Virtues, a Servant to the basest
of Vices: Nay, I know not
which is worst, to forsake
<hi>Christ,</hi> or to follow him for
gain; to serve <hi>Christ</hi> for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
or the Devil for nothing;
unless we doe God less injury
to forsake <hi>Christ,</hi> than to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
him to doe him injury,
and to make him a Servant
to our Avarice. If these be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:40891:25"/>
our Virtues, what shall our
Vices be? and what Virtues
can these be that thus dance
after the Devills pipe? <hi>This
is also Vanity, and a vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Corruption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This makes some men,<note place="margin">Solitary life.</note>
(when they consider that
<hi>Vanity</hi> hath over-spred all
Worldly things, that Vice
and Wickedness have infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all estates and conditions
of men, to the intent to wind
themselves out and get away)
confine themselves to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts
and a perpetual solitude,
there to remain in extreme
silence, and to speak with
none but God and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and though this soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
humor in diverse proceed
from a savage disposition, in
others from a weakness, and
spirit not capable of the socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:40891:26"/>
of men; in others, from
an ambitious desire to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for some extraordinary
profession, because they could
not be seen enough in the
Common Crowd; in others,
from anger and despite, that
they have so long tyred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in striving against the
stream, and to be crossed in
every thing; So I doubt not
but there are some who pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely
withdraw themselves,
and take upon them this soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
condition, to get out of
the crowd of Vices, and to
serve God with more liberty;
but even these are deceived,
and when they think to goe
out of the World at one
door, they come in at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
for griefs of mind, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40891:26"/>
Melancholy,</hi> despair, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
and self-admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
steal insensibly into the
mind under a profession of
extraordinary Sanctity, which
pines the spirits of the peevish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
arrogant, and of peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
devotion, which degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
oftentimes into folly or
brutishness.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Solitary Man</hi> hath
none to comfort him in his
heaviness, and having none
to compare withall, thinks
himself the most excellent:
then also inordinate desires
multiplie upon him, for Man
ever thinks that best that is
furthest off. So St. <hi>Jerome</hi>
in the midst of the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,<note place="margin">In his Ep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Eustoch.</hi>
                  </note> and in abstinent solitude,
yet burnt with incontinent
affections, and his mind ran
most on dancing with Maids,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:40891:27"/>
and when the Devil followed
<hi>Christ</hi> into the Wilderness, he
thought that the fittest place
for temptation and if the
Devil set upon the Sonne of
God in the Desert, what
Monk or Cloysterer thinks
to goe free? The safest way
is to goe out of the World,
not with feet, but affections,
and first to keep the World
from nestling in our hearts or
near us, lest when we goe out
of the World we carry it with
us; for as a Man may be
Worldly and Wicked, though
he make a shew to live out of
the world, so he may leave
the World and yet never
come in the Wilderness, and
live among a multitude as if
he were alone, and even in a
Court or Palace behold the
evill travell of men, and have
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40891:27"/>
no share with them, and
where the greatest talk is,
there to talk with himself a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
and confer with God;
and to imploy himself to the
edifying of the Church, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
those right that are
wrong, and to bring them
again into the way to Heaven,
and by no means to hide the
talent in the ground, and to
lop himself off (as an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
branch) from the
Bodie of <hi>Civill Society,</hi> thus
the Apostles did, and all
those lights who brought so
great glory to the Church,
and yet shine after their
death.</p>
               <p>I know that <hi>Aristotle</hi> spake

                     </gap>.</hi>
that he that is disposed to So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litariness
is either of a divine,
or a base spirit, as much as
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40891:28"/>
to say, He forsakes the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of men, either because
his Virtues are above them,
or he inferiour and not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to come among them;
But I say, that he that loves
Solitude because he excells o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in Virtue, or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
ought to subdue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and to descend (by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
and gentleness) to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
imperfections, bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself every way in
word and action to the
good of the Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</p>
               <p>For what are all our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
but poor shadowes
and obscure traces of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of <hi>Christ?</hi> yet he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
like unto men, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed
among men, that he
might save men: From all
which I gather this conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40891:28"/>
That if it be a <hi>Vanity</hi> to
forsake the World, then much
more to follow it, and if Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(with all their mischiefs)
nestle in the Deserts, much
more in the common crowd:
Surely if <hi>Vanity</hi> be thus found

               <p>Now,<note place="margin">Old Age.</note> while Man busies
himself about all his vain

forward with the Shoulders,
every day begins a-fresh to
rise up, and lye down again,
to fill and empty his belly like

a Mill-horse in the circle of
of the same tedious occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Behold old Age comes
stealing on, which yet but a
few attain unto; Every one
desires to come to it, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40891:29"/>
when they are at it they wish
it farther off: This is as it
were the sink and setlings of
mans life, the worst of all to
the Worldly, and the best to
the Godly; then are World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
men more way-ward than
ever, then they grow fearfull
and froward, and (to speak
truly) weak in Judgement<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
for we cannot properly call
that humour wisdom, which
is any way irksome, nor want
of power, Sobrietie; an old
Man does not leave pleasures,
but they leave him; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
without cause, that the
Fashions and Manners of Men
are changed into worse; 'tis
himself that is altered: when
he was young, every thing
pleased him, though never so
had, when he is old, nothing
can please him, though never
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:40891:29"/>
so good; like a Man in a
Wherry, who thinks the shore
moves, when 'tis himself. It
is also a fault of old age to
talk much, because they can
doe little, therefore they
think 'tis their part to teach
young Men, and to tell of old
matters done a great while
agoe; So towards the decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of a <hi>State</hi> (as of the
<hi>Roman Empire)</hi> much talke
but little actions. In the
Worlds old age, many curious
Disputes, but little piety and
solid Religion. Old Age is
covetous, and worldy cares
then come a fresh, every thing
growes gray and withered
save onely Vice. The old
Man the <hi>Apostle</hi> so often
speaks of, growes not old to
the World, but is then in his
prime; he sees Death at hand,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:40891:30"/>
and holds Life but like an Eel
by the tayl, yet he devises
long-breathed plots, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
and heaps up riches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
as if <hi>Death</hi> were a
great way off; then is Man
loath to leave his Life when
it is least worth, and little
left but Lees: He never thinks
of <hi>Death,</hi> though his Age
gives him warning of it and
every grey hair serves for a
Summons: Nay, <hi>Death</hi> often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
takes an earnest of him,
by the loss of an Arm, or an
Eye, or a Legge, to put him
in minde that shortly after
he will have the rest. Again,
old Men are besotted with
the World through long
custom and acquaintance,
and are loth to leave it,
though they find no good
in it; <hi>This is also a Vanity

<hi>Death</hi> comes,<note place="margin">Death.</note> which takes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

knowes how to live in the

most men goe out of the

why they came in; they
would fain adjourn time, but
<hi>Death</hi> will not listen to any
composition; His feet are of
Wooll, but his hands of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron;
he comes stealing in,
but what he layes hold of
he never lets goe. Man
makes as slow hast thither as
he can. If a Ship split 100

not so much to save himself
from drowning, as to set the

clock a little back for some
minutes, and perswade <hi>Death</hi>
to give Nature a little longer
time to pay the debt; this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

can resolve himself; The very
remembrance of <hi>Death</hi> or Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,

is a Song of the Sabbathday,
to teach us that this Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
requires a setled and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questred

of the crowd of worldy
thoughts to enter into Gods

That <hi>he was grieved at

               <p>All that which is already
said is but a rough draught,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40891:37"/>
or the first traces to represent
superficially the vanity and
misery of our nature, and the
actions of men; we will now
consider their thoughts. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
in the 94th. Psalm saies
thus, <hi>God knoweth the
thoughts of man that they are
but vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If a man could at night ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
together all the thoughts
which have run through his
fancy in the day, he would
wonder and be amased at
their number and vanity,
much more at their folly;
<hi>Painters</hi> antick works come
nothing neer them.</p>
               <p>One locks himself into his
study, where he resolves to
study very hard, but when he
is in he does nothing else but
tell the quarrells of his win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,<note place="margin">Sutton.</note> or (like <hi>Domitian)</hi>
hunts after flies:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:40891:37"/>
Another walkes up and
down sad and solitary, and
begins to rave in his own
thoughts what he would do
if he were a King; or if he
had a million of Crowns how
bravely he would spend them;
or thinking of his domestick
business, linkes together a
chain of long hopes, and by
little and little becomes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
rich in his own wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
dream, and when he
comes to himself and sees his
own poverty, he flings away
and bites the lip at it.</p>
               <p>Nay even in the times of
preaching and prayer, when
God speaks to us, or we to
him, our minds wander up
and down; and if our best a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
be thus besmeared,
and mixt with vanity, how
much more our idle and
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:40891:38"/>
unprofitable houres?</p>
               <p>These foolish thoughts ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with vain desires
and ignorance suitable, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moyl,
and toss so the spirits
of Man, that he can never rest.</p>
               <p>When man is in his brown
study then he gathers and
heaps together all the evills
that ever befell him, he frets
and fumes at the present, falls
to calculate what is to come,
and more than ever shall
happen, he changeth doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
fears for certain miseries;
Fear makes many miserable
before they come at it; many
dye out of fear to dye; every
day hath affliction enough of
its own; who can ever be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
in himself, that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
sets before him all the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills
past, and to come, the
one by memory, the other by
fear?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:40891:38"/>
This naturall restlesness
makes a man toss and tumble
up and down, as a sick man
is ever changing his Bed, and
ever worse at last, and finds
no rest but when he is weary
of stirring; he carries the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
allwaies about him, and is
never the better for remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving:
Nay I verily believe
that if God had set man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
good and bad to take
his choice (and to cut out of
the whole cloath) he would
chuse the bad, he is so blind
in judgment; or if the good,
he would make it bad, his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is so perverse; if God
sent him no evill, he would
provide some for himself; if
his own evill could not vex
him, he would be grieved at
anothers good, for envy frets
him more than affliction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:40891:39"/>
Hence it comes that men
are alwaies coveting, but they
know not what, they are hot
in desire, but cold in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
like a bird that would
flie, and can flutter but with
one wing, nay they are often
distracted with a desire of
contrarieties.</p>
               <p>One complaines that his
wife is dead, another that
his wife will not dye; one
grieves for the loss of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
another that his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are so leud as he counts
them, all lost; one tired with

               <p>But alas in this vanity of
our thoughts,<note place="margin">Weakness and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> and variety
of our affections, we shew
great weakness of Spirit, for
the face and fashion of things
move us more than the things
themselves.</p>
               <p>One sees a tragedy acted
which he knows to be but a
fable, and nothing concerns
him, yet he cryes for pitie,
but for his own miseries ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
sheds a tear.</p>
               <p>Another hangs himself with
despair, who at the same
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:40891:40"/>
time would have run away as
fast as he could if another had
offered to run him through
with a sword; the difference
is this, the last comes with a
horror and fear, the first is
felt before tis seen.</p>
               <p>Opinion moves more than
the things; Many eat they
know not what, but find they
like it, and being told what
it is, streight it goes against
their stomacks, and they cast
it up again.</p>
               <p>Others are more afraid of
Mouse or a Toad than of a
Sword; sure our conceipts are
often moved and transported
with very childish toyes and
fancies.</p>
               <p>Again (but I cannot give
the reason of it) sometimes a
man studies to cozen himself;
one tels a tale which he knows
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:40891:40"/>
to be false, yet he tells it so
often, and with that assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
that at length he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
tis true.</p>
               <p>Some husband knowes his
wife but hard-favoured and a
blowse, yet when he sees
her sophisticated and painted
he begins to think her fair,
and she her self too begins to
think she is well-favoured and
beautifull.</p>
               <p>What a number there are
that believe a religion because
they will believe it? who
strive against their own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and whose Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
tells them thus, Me
thinks that seems absurd, and
agrees not with Scripture, but
I will have it so, and I will
thinke it so too; this is to
have Faith in a string, and not
subject Will to Religion,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:40891:41"/>
but Religion to Will.</p>
               <p>Above all things mans
judgement shews it self wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
in religion, for outward
actions demonstrate what is
inwardly apprehended of the
service of God; in matters of
news, we give more credit to
one eye-witness than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of a Country, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
we are caryed with the
common opinion, and love
to follow the fashion, and
to go with the croud; when
a man puts out money he will
be as sure as he can to lend
to honest and sufficient men,
and to take good security,
but in matters of Conscience
he nere looks farther than to
the priest; I will now shew
you some damnable trifles of
reverend estimation.</p>
               <p>1 To clad pictures of men
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40891:41"/>
in silk and gold, when the

picture of God.</p>
               <p>2 To put off the hat at the

               </p>
               <p>3 To carry a flaring Cross
upon the belly, when the belly
is the enemy of the Cross of
Christ.</p>
               <p>4 Going to a Bawdy-house,
or returning from some
ill act, to rumble over the
beads.</p>
               <p>5 To kneel as well before
the empty Pix, when the
Priest comes from a sick man,
as if it were full.</p>
               <p>6 To adore the Host in
the Pix, and not as well to
adore it in the stomack of
him that received it.</p>
               <p>7 To make his Creator with
a few words, and then to eat
him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:40891:42"/>
8 To revell and riot one
day in Shrovetide; and the
next day to be very grave and
reserved.</p>
               <p>9 To imploy some blessed
Beads for the remission of

               <p>11 To Whip ones self o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly

               <p>12 In honour of Saints to

               <p>These and many more such
toyes man hath devised in his

not dislike them; Nay he
goes so far as he bestows the
Offices in <hi>Paradice,</hi> he makes
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:40891:42"/>
one a Patron of one Country,
another a Physitian for one
disease, another for another,
as if the <hi>Ants</hi> should dispose
the affairs of a Kingdom, all
this (to say no worse) is a
vanity and an extreme want
of understanding.</p>
               <p>We who have only the
word of God for our rule are
not exempted, for we mingle
our one folly, and vanities,
with the sacred verities of
Gods word.</p>
               <p>In Civill actions when we
need advise we go to our
friends, but in matters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
we consult only with
our own sense and inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
desires, which are our
domestique enemies.</p>
               <p>If a man owe us money we
had rather have the money
than his word; In matters
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:40891:43"/>
concerning God it is quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise:
For the Gospel is
the obligation whereby God
promiseth salvation to us, sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with the blood of his own
Son, yet we had rather keep
the obligation, than be payd
the debt when we die, and
then we would fain give a
longer day.</p>
               <p>One tels a childish weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in <hi>Honorius</hi> the Emperor,<note place="margin">Zonaras.</note>
who made so much of a Hen,
(which he called <hi>Roma)</hi> that
when it was told him that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
was lost, Alas! (said he
with a sigh) <hi>Roma</hi> was here
even now. Sir, sayes one to
him, we talk not of a Hen,
but your City <hi>Roma,</hi> taken
and sack'd by <hi>Alaric</hi> the

heard that, he was prettily
cheered again, as esteeming
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:40891:43"/>
that loss farre more tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Such is our weakness, we
give none leave to meddle
with our money, but we give
any man leave to draw us to
Vice, to seduce us with Error,
and to poyson our Souls: I
will proceed, and shew more
of the like.</p>
               <p>None are so fond as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse
to take Physick but of a
man of excellent language;
Yet many refuse to hear a
Preacher of the Gospel unless
he be eloquent, and the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
is the Souls Physick; were
it not a brutish madness in a
Malefactor to refuse a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
because it is not Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically
penned? and why may
not the Word of God please
well enough, although It be
not flourished over, and trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:40891:44"/>
with the graces of art,
since it is the Letters Patents of
Grace and Pardon, and the
doctrine of our reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with God; As if we should
like our Fathers rod best
when it is tyed with silk? this
is a peevish vanity, and a chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish
humour.</p>
               <p>It is strange to observe how
vain, absurd, and foolish our
Judgement is of others, and
in the esteem or dis-esteem of
our selves.</p>
               <p>If we talk of burthens, he
is best, that bears most;
if of injuries, he that will
bear none; so we change
strength and valour into
weakness and impatience.</p>
               <p>In matters of Ornament,
we judge not of the Blade
by the beauty of the Scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard,
nor of an Horse by his
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:40891:44"/>
fine Bridle or Saddle; why
then doe we esteem of a man
by his good or bad cloaths?
If we salute a man for his
Apparrel, we might as well
complement with the Stuff in
the Shop: why are we so
considerate in slight matters,
and so inconsiderate in our
judgement of matters of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>We esteem well of a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
or Auditor, that is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and exact in accounts,
though he live so as he can
give God no good account of
his life; one orders his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and grounds handsomly,
and himself lies rude, wast
and out of all order.</p>
               <p>We are no less vain and
childish in our feares;<note place="margin">Vain fears.</note> for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
as little Children play
with fire and burn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:40891:45"/>
and are afraid as soon
as their Father comes sodain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon them; so men play
with pleasures (because they
glister and look gay) till at
length they hurt themselves.
As Children are afraid of
their Father, when he comes
to them with a vizard on, we
are frighted when God comes
suddainly upon us under the
mask of afflictions, sickness,
or death.</p>
               <p>Man also forges to himself
dangerous or foolish fears;
One fears that his Wife likes
another better than himself,
and hunts and seeks for that
he would not find, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the Wife grows angry,
and revenges herself, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as much as he feared.</p>
               <p>Another fears he shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
rise to Honor, and does
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40891:45"/>
somewhat to bring him to the

memory with perpetuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy.</p>
               <p>Another fears he shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

it, and dies before he tasts the

               <p>Another feares to die a

him a Wife that makes him
more miserable than he was

               <p>And when I consider the

bargain, and to undermine
one another, but let me see
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40891:46"/>
him that is best seen in all
these things, and bring him
before the Sun-shine of Gods
Word, and the Brightness of
the Gospel, and then he is
stark blind, and will be so
still; and though he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casts
what future changes and
chances shall be in the State,
yet he sees not how nigh at
hand his own destruction
is, and though he can talk
and discourse of matters of
State, yet he is but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
slave; and this weak-sigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
knowledge dares contest
with God, and the folly of
the children of darkness with
the wisdom of the Father of
lights; and mans prudence
with Gods providence: for
the wicked cover themselves
with silence, subtilty, and
dissembling, like little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40891:46"/>
who think they are hid,
when they shut their eyes;
and that no body sees them,
because they see no body; but
God sees them all bare and
naked, better than they see
themselves. God who is not
only all hand (as holding and
guiding all) but also all Eye,
(as seeing or searching all
things) he sees through the
thickest substance, and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is light unto him, and
therefore the Royall Prophet
Ps. 94. justly taxes this sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish
wisdom, <hi>Take heed ye
unwise among the people, ye
fools when will you understand,
he that planted the ear, shall
not be hear? or he that made
the eye, shall not he see?</hi> In
this place the Prophet calls
them unwise, not the fools
that run mad up and down
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40891:47"/>
the streets, not the Idiots, not
the gross common people, but
the great Politicians, who
manage all their matters so
smoothly, as if they thought
to hide themselves from the
All-seeing wisdom of God,
or to dazle the eyes of his
providence; but as those are
the fiercest Fevers that have
the coldest Fit at first, so that
is the most desperate folly
that is vizarded with wisdom
and greatest discretion.</p>
               <p>Thus the Godly man must
observe the actions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
of men, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
all the unprofitable tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
of this life, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
frame his Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>There are two sorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the life of man, as there
is in a Fair; Some come to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40891:47"/>
buy and sell, others only to
look about; He that fears
God is but a looker on;
he comes not to buy or
sell, but onely to observe
the workes of God, and the
actions of men, that when
he sees the glitter of vaine
curiosities, which men ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to view, he may say,
Oh! what a number of things
there are in this world, that I
have no need of? but if
(while he be thus looking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout)
he happen to get some
hurt, or be justled, or have
his purse cut, (that is, if he be
troubled, or afflicted) he
will presently be gone, and
remembring that he is but a
stranger in this world, he
will set forward towards his
own Countrie, his home in
the Heavens, ayming always
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:40891:48"/>
(as the Apostle saith) <hi>towards
the mark of the high calling of

<hi>better part,</hi> which cannot
be taken from him; conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all his Meditations of
Vanity, as <hi>Salomon</hi> did in the
end of his <hi>Ecclesiastes, The
End of all is this, Fear God,
and keep his Commandements,
for this is the whole duty of,
Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>After this Meditation we
must rest our selves upon
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:40891:48"/>
those two</hi> Maxims <hi>and</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
<hi>which are the two
Sanctuaries of Religion, the
first,</hi> That to love God we must
contemn the world; <hi>the second,</hi>
that to contemn the world we
must be think our selves of our
own worth and dignity, and the
excellency of our vocation.</p>
               <p>The first <hi>Maxime</hi> is taken
out of the Epistle of St. <hi>John,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 16. 11.</note>
                  <hi>Love not the world, nor the
things of the world; If any love
the world, the love of God is not
in him, for all that which is in
the world, as the lust of the
flesh, the lust of the eyes, &amp; the
pride of life, is not of the father
but is of the world, &amp; the world
passeth away,</hi> &amp;c. Nothing
drives us further fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the love
of God than the love of the
world, for the Scripture calls
the world the Kingdom of
<hi>Sathan;</hi> and as the Moon
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:40891:49"/>
hath no light but by oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
to the Sun, so our Souls
are in darkness but when we
look unto God; So again it
followes, that as the Moon
hath no light in the shadow
of the earth,<note place="margin">Luke 16. 8.</note> so our Souls
lose their light (as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
calls us Children of
light) when they are obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and eclipsed with the
love of earthly things,<note place="margin">Eph. 1. 8.</note> as
worldly cares and covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which we ought to tread
under our feet, like the
Church in the <hi>Revelation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rev. 12.</note>
which hath the Moon under
her Feet, that is tramples up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all the unchangeable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steadiness
of these sublunary
things. And as <hi>Christ</hi> would
have the penny paid for
Tribute to <hi>Caesar</hi> because it
bare his Image, so we must
give our selves to God because
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:40891:49"/>
we bear his Image; the misery
is this, we often deface the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage,
and batter it against
the ground, bemiring our
selves with base thoughts and
dirty desires.</p>
               <p>Therefore to the end we
may contemn the world, and
all the World can promise
or doe for us, we must come
to the second point, which
is to know the worth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of Godly men; for
when men by Fox-friendship
and cruell subtilty would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
a godly man to doe ill,
and to sin against God and
his own Conscience, then let
him look into himself and
thus Argue; I that am a
child of God, of heavenly
parentage, one of the first-born,
whose names are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in heaven, shall I value
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:40891:50"/>
the promises of the world
any thing worth, which (if
they were certain) yet they
are too mean for me? Win
a Kings Son with apples?
tempt the Son of the great
Prince of Heaven with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to offend his Father? and
like <hi>Esau</hi> sell his birthright
for a Mess of potage? I will
never doe it, God will never
suffer me to be so hood-winked;
He is not worthy
of <hi>Christ</hi> that doth not think
the world unworthy of him;
was not the world made for
the Godlies sake? and will
not God destroy it again, and
provide an house far more
glorious for us, and a more
beautifull heaven than that
we now behold, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
too mean for the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Gods children? thou
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:40891:50"/>
that fearest God, and hast
faith in his Son, I would have
thee know, that it is thou
that upholdest the world, and
for whose sake the wicked
are yet suffered to live; so far
are Gods enemies indebted
to thee. And God suffers the
world to continue for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects
sake, whereof some are
mixed with the wicked, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
are not yet born, and
(as it is in the 6th of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation)
God stayes untill the
number of our Brethren be
fulfilled;</hi> and that is one of
the causes why our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
calls his disciples the
Salt of the Earth,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 31.</note> as a small
part among men that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
the rest, and retards the
dissolution; God continuing
the Bad for the Goods sake,
that the bad may profit at the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:40891:51"/>
example of the Good, and
by that means be driven to
fear God, and trust in his
promises; this being the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of Gods children,
they must esteem of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
riches, and glory of
the world but as trifles,
and like the painted King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
which the Devill offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When men look down
from the top of the <hi>Alpes</hi>
to the plains below them, the
greatest Towns would seem
no better than little Cabins,
how much would they seem
far less to be seen from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
The Godly man must
think he is in Heaven, and
look down upon earth from
thence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he will still keep his
heart above, and thence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
the Palaces of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40891:51"/>
they will seem to him lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Ant-hills: and the tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
tossing up and down of
Nations as the swarming of
Bees, when they are disquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and then well observing
what is most remarkable, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
and conspicuous
upon earth, he will say,
<hi>Vanity of Vanities, all is Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This blessed magnanimity
shall nothing hinder <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
humility, for we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
our selves unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
but are made worthy by
<hi>Christ Iesus;</hi> If repentance
cast us down, faith sets us up
again; If of our selves we be
nothing, yet through God
and his Fatherly love unto
us we are made something;
thus the Godly quite differ
from the worldlings, the last
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:40891:52"/>
lifts up his Pharisaicall eyes
to heaven, but his heart is
on earth, and set upon lust
and covetousness, the first
looks alwayes downward in
humility like the <hi>Publican</hi>
who durst not look up to
Heaven,<note place="margin">Lu. 18. 31.</note> yet by faith and hope
hath his heart there, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temns
the world not for the
love of himself, but for the
love of God.</p>
               <p>Wickedness that now reigns.</p>
               <p>This is not all, for if we
contemn the world for the
love of God, it will at last
make us hate the world, when
(besides the misery and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
thereof,) we see the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
wickedness that reigns,
and stands in defiance with
God; when (besides the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
that is set to open sale)
we are to consider the villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:40891:52"/>
that is kept close, <hi>Treasons,
Murders, Adulteries,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in secret, and when
we consider the viols of the
wrath and curse of God pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out generally upon all
men; For when we will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into a due consideration
of the world, we must set it
before us all at once, and
behold it together, and then
at one glance run over all the
people of the world, among
which a number are <hi>Pagans,</hi>
who worship the Devil, and
that not in Ignorance (not
knowing what they do) but
in expresse profession: the
<hi>East-Indians</hi> build him Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and doe him all service;
The <hi>West-Indians</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
tortured and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with wicked Spirits; in
most parts of the North they
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:40891:53"/>
make a sport to be <hi>War wolfs,</hi>
and it becomes a tollerable
custome; <hi>Witcherie</hi> is also a
common profession there;
there the <hi>Devil</hi> domineers
without contradiction.</p>
               <p>In the flourshing Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
(where the Apostles so
happily planted the Gospel)
the Churches are turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Mosquees,</hi> and Temples
of Idolatry.</p>
               <p>In the West, the outward
face of the Church is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
an earthly Monarchie,
and great Money-banks are
set in the place where Gods
house was once seated.</p>
               <p>Amongst all these so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
sundry and severall Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
the <hi>Iewes</hi> are scattered,
who blasphemed, and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
<hi>Christ</hi> while he lived,
and have continued to doe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:40891:53"/>
him all wrong ever since he
died.</p>
               <p>In the Countrey from
whence the <hi>Decretals</hi> come,
(and which rules Religion
at this day) Bawdy-houses
are common, and <hi>Sodomy</hi>
grown a fashion, and yet the
decision of the doubts of
Faith must be coyned in the
place of all this villany.</p>
               <p>The other part of the
world who serve God truly,
are but an handfull, who
have much a doe to live in so
bad an ayr, who are upon
earth as Fishes out of the
water; the remainders of
Massacres, and as scattered
shivers of a broken ship. Yet
for all this (even among this
small number of people pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of the rest of the
world) evil increases, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:40891:54"/>
spreds like a Canker or Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene,
Quarrels, Vanity,
Excess in apparell, Ambition,
(which lavishly layes out)
Covetousness (which Idlely
locks up) infect a part of
Gods flock, God ill served in
housholds, cold charity, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
of Gods word, to be
short, a Contagion of Vices
by the unwearied Industry
of our Adversary, which is
a step to superstition, from
Vices we passe to errour, and
from corporall to spirituall
whoredom; If then God be
so ill served where he is so
well known, what will he
be in other parts of the
world? If vices lodge in the
Pulpit how much more in the
Porch and in the house of
the wicked? therefore <hi>Christ</hi>
calls the <hi>Devil</hi> fitly the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:40891:54"/>
                  <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> and St.
<hi>Peter</hi> justly cryes out in the
2d. of the <hi>Acts, Save your
selves from this froward gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi>
for <hi>Sathan</hi> lyes in wait,
seeking whom he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
this Age is infectious,
vices stick fast, temptations
are powerfull, our enemies
strong, and subtile, our selves
weak and simple, the way to
heaven straight and ragged,
few there are (sayes <hi>Christ)</hi>
that find it, and many that
have found it cannot keep it,
but having known the truth
forsake it again, and return
to their vomit, let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
take heed of the world,
and keep our selves from so
dangerous a place, let us pass
by it (as Strangers) leaving
the world and leaning to
God; we are never truly at
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:40891:55"/>
rest, but when we rest wholly
upon God and his promises:
Heaven is in continuall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and that is the place of
our rest; and on the other
side the earth doth alwayes
rest, and that's the place of
our agitation; <hi>Dyalls</hi> and
<hi>Clocks</hi> follow the motion of
the heaven, but the faith of
the Godly imitates the rest
above the heavens, for that
teacheth us to set our rest up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
God; <hi>Ulisses</hi> liked bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the smoke of his own
house than the fire of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
yea how much more
liked he his own fire than
anothers smoke? we are
strangers here, this is none
of our house, our house is in
heaven, shall we then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the smoke of our strange
habitation in another Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40891:55"/>
and the darkness of the
earth, before the fire of our
own house, and the glory
of our own home which is
the Kingdom of Heaven?</p>
               <p>This is the Kingdom of
<hi>Satan,</hi> that the Kingdom of
God, this a vale of Teares,
that the top of all bliss, here
we sowe in sorrow, there we
shall reap in joy; here we
see the Suns light through
two little holes, which we
call Eyes, there we shall see
Gods light on all sides as if
we were all Eye, Then when
God shall be all in all, to
whom be Honor and Glory
for evermore.</p>
