            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

things, are yet in the ſtate of miſery.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe a man is in the ſtate of
miſery till he hath repented: Now, until
a man have forſaken his <hi>old thoughts,</hi> that
man hath not repented. <hi>Oh Jeruſalem, waſh
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:38284:10"/>
thy heart,</hi> Jer. 4. 14. A man muſt not only
rid himſelf of vain thoughts, but he muſt
waſh his heart clean, with this Emphaſis,
<hi>That he may be ſaved:</hi> No ſalvation without
this. <hi>How long ſhall vain thoughts lodge within
thee?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. As a man is in the ſtate of miſery,
till he have repented, ſo alſo till he is in
Chriſt. Now when a man is led by his
own vain <hi>thoughts,</hi> his <hi>thoughts</hi> being not
ſanctified; ſo long that man is not in Chriſt;
if he were in Chriſt, Chriſt would ſanctifie
his <hi>thoughts.</hi> I, but may ſome man ſay, He
hath wronged me, <hi>ergo,</hi> I will think thus
and thus. Nay, but Chriſt caſteth down
the ſtrong holds, and if thou wilt not yield,
Chriſt will caſt thee off; but if thou belong
to Chriſt, he will caſt all down before
thee.</p>
            <p>3. That man is in the ſtate of miſery,
that doth not love God, that walks not
with God in his thoughts. <hi>Thou ſhalt love
the Lord thy God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 22. 37. So I do,
ſayes one, and yet I think on my vanities
too: And thus carnal men think they love
God. But if thou love God with all thy
heart, thou loveſt him with all that is in thy
heart; for what is a mans heart, but the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:38284:10"/>
purpoſes of his heart? Now if a man give
not over vain purpoſes, he loves not God
with all his heart.</p>
            <p>4. That man that cannot forſake ſinne,
is in the ſtate of miſery, and can never
enter into life; (ſee the Text) <hi>the wicked
must forſake his wayes.</hi> A man muſt deny his
own words, and ſpeak according to Gods
own warrant: the <hi>actions</hi> of mens lives
are the wayes of their <hi>thoughts;</hi> the Tongue
muſt not only <hi>forſake his way,</hi> but the Heart
his way alſo; elſe a man is a wicked man,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 26. He is wicked whoſe <hi>thoughts</hi>
are not ſanctified. But what will men ſay?
ſhal we be condemned for a <hi>thought?</hi> words
are ſmall ſins, and <hi>thoughts</hi> are leſſe: Muſt
a man then ſo ſtrictly look to his <hi>thoughts?</hi>
I will make it plain, that for a man to be
vain-thoughted, is a grievous ſin.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe if the ſin of vain thoughts
be pardoned, it will ask <hi>abundance of mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mark the Text, <hi>Abundantly pardon:</hi>
No repentance, no mercy, without abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance;
<hi>ergo,</hi> it is not ſo ſmall as the world
takes it to be.</p>
            <p>2. Thoughts are the <hi>ſins of the highest
part of a man;</hi> for they are the ſins of the
heart; and ſurely the ſins of the chiefeſt
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38284:11"/>
part are greater then any other. A King
counts it not much for a Rogue to ſteale by
the wayes ſide, but for a Knight or a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
it is a foul matter: So the Lord would
not have the <hi>lordly part</hi> to ſin againſt him;
He would not have the <hi>longue,</hi> much leſſe
the <hi>heart,</hi> that is the Kingly part of a man,
to tranſgreſſe. And this is the reaſon why
<hi>Deborah</hi> calls them <hi>great thoughts of heart,
Judg.</hi> 5. 15. Sins in thought, are great ſins:
the Heart is the lady, the miſtreſſe, or high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
part of a man; and He that hath made
us, looks that we ſhould ſerve him with the
the Maſter-part; That muſt be afforded
him.</p>
            <p>3. Becauſe <hi>thoughts</hi> are breaches or every
<hi>Commandement;</hi> Other ſins are but againſt
one, but all the Commandements condemn
vain thoughts. The firſt Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods but
me;</hi> But thou ſetteſt an Image up in thy
heart, when thou thinkeſt of thy pleaſures,
&amp;c. So, <hi>Thou ſhalt keep holy the Sabbath day:</hi>
Now if thou think thine own thoughts that
day, thou breakeſt this commandement;
and ſo of all the reſt: The ſin of <hi>thought</hi> is
therefore a heinous ſin.</p>
            <p>4. Becauſe they are the ſtrength of a
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38284:11"/>
mans heart and ſoule, the firſt-born of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
corruption. A man by nature is a
child of wrath, a ſoul and a body of death.
Now what doth the heart firſt break out in?
It firſt ſhews it ſelfe in its thoughts; and if
it be the firſt-borne, it muſt needs be the
ſtrength: as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid to <hi>Ruben</hi> his firſt-born,
he was his <hi>ſtrength;</hi> and therefore all Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
lies in the heart; A man may more
eaſily part with all other ſins then with this,
becauſe the bent of the heart runs this way;
the heart will part with any ſin, rather then
with his pernicious <hi>thoughts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Becauſe they are the <hi>deareſt acts of
men.</hi> We count a man preferred, when he is
preferred to the <hi>thoughts</hi> of a man, <hi>Gen</hi>
40. 14. <hi>Think on me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Joſeph</hi> to <hi>Pharaohs</hi>
Butler: I count it thanks enough, if thou
preferred me to thy <hi>thoughts.</hi> We prize that
moſt, which we think moſt on; That which
a man ſcorns, he ſcorns to beſtow his <hi>thoughts</hi>
on; but that which a man ſets his heart on,
that is his dearling. Now that any thing
ſhould be dear to a man, ſave God, this is a
horrible ſin; when a man makes his Dogs
his dearling, his Whore his dearling, &amp;c.
For look what thou moſt thinkeſt on, that
is thy dearling: Why? Becauſe thou
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38284:12"/>
dandleſt it in thy heart; therefore it is a
horrible ſin for a man not to ſet his heart
upon God.</p>

thou muſt have more <hi>thoughts;</hi> Thou art

be fuller. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 59. When <hi>David</hi>

thought on his wayes on both ſides.</hi> The curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

full of ends and ſhreds. So the Prophet
looks on <hi>his way</hi> on both ſides; he ſtrives
to walk curiouſly, preciſely, and accurately

            <p>Firſt, Becauſe it is a hard thing to <hi>reform
ones ſelf;</hi> one thing may reform another;
but here is the difficulty, for a thing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it ſelf: it is an eaſie matter for a mans
<hi>heart</hi> to reform his <hi>tongue,</hi> but it is hard for
the heart to reform it ſelf, in correcting its
own <hi>thoughts:</hi> it is hard for a man to deny
himſelf. A hell-hound may reform his
tongue; but here is the difficulty, for
his heart to reform it ſelf, for <hi>thoughts</hi> are
are the heart, <hi>Phil. 3. 19. who mind earthly
things;</hi> thoughts of earthly things are
called the mind; a mans <hi>thoughts</hi> and his
<hi>mind</hi> are all one, ſo that if it reform <hi>thoughts</hi>
it muſt reform it ſelf.</p>
            <p>2. It is hard to reform <hi>thoughts,</hi> becauſe
they are <hi>partial acts;</hi> if they were full acts,
a man might reform them, rather then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
partial acts: my reaſon is, becauſe
they are in every action he doth; <hi>thoughts</hi>
run on all mens actions; if <hi>thoughts</hi> were
alone, men might mend them: but they
buſie themſelves about all actions; if a
man pray, <hi>thoughts</hi> run along with him in
prayer, nay men pray with twiſted <hi>thoughts,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:38284:13"/>
ſo that before he comes to an end of his
prayer, he ſhall have abundance of glance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
on other things. See it in old <hi>Eli,
1 Sam. 1. Hanna</hi> was praying; Old <hi>Eli,</hi>
ſaith the Text, <hi>thought ſhe had been drunken.</hi>
Either he was, or ſhould have been pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alſo; yet you ſee he had wandring
<hi>thoughts</hi> to mark the lips of his neighbours.
So, as <hi>John</hi> was preaching, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. there
came a <hi>thought</hi> into his hearers hearts, that
<hi>they were the ſeed of Abraham.</hi> What did
make them think ſo? <hi>John</hi> ſpake of no ſuch
matter; but he ſaid, <hi>Every tree that brings
not forth good fruit, &amp;c.</hi> They had, it
ſeems, by-thoughts in the duty of hearing:
therefore ſeeing <hi>thoughts</hi> do thus <hi>twiſt</hi> them
ſelves about mens actions, hence it is that
they are ſo hard to be rooted out.</p>
            <p>3. It is hard for men to forſake their
own <hi>thought,</hi> becauſe they are in mens
hearts, <hi>Their inward thoughts,</hi> Pſal. 49. 11.
Every man hath two kinde of <hi>thoughts,
inward,</hi> and <hi>outward; explicite,</hi> and <hi>impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite;</hi>
implicite thoughts are thoſe that
never ſhew themſelves in the heart, but at
ſome deſperate attempt; Explicite, are
thoſe which are in the heart every day:
as in <hi>Pſal. 49, 11. They think their Houſes
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38284:13"/>
ſhall continue for ever.</hi> Would you think
that men ſhould have ſuch <hi>thoughts</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
their <hi>ourtward thoughts</hi> were, they were
mortal; <hi>We ſee</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>that
men die, &amp;c.</hi> and yet they think inwardly
<hi>that they ſhall live for ever.</hi> Now according
to theſe <hi>inward thoughts</hi> men act; and
hence it is that men neglect repentance,
and other holy duties, as if God would
never call them to an account; they have
not theſe thoughts above-board, but they
are <hi>inward,</hi> and theſe ſpoile the heart, and
theſe are the cauſes why men cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
their own <hi>thoughts. Epiphanius</hi> ſpeaks
of a fig-tree which grew in a wall, &amp;c. Bad
thoughts will be alwayes ſeizing on a man
till he dies, and then <hi>all his thoughts periſh.</hi>
But ſo long as a man is alive in <hi>old Adam,
theſe thoughts</hi> are rooted in the bottom of
the ſoul, which hinder good duties; and this
is the cauſe why vanity of mind ſprouts up.</p>

               </label>
               <hi>Examine your ſelves then;</hi> for it is one
of the beſt wayes for a man to try his eſtate
by, even to examine his <hi>thoughts.</hi> If a man
would ſee whether the ſea be ſalt, he need
not drink all the water that is in it; one
drop will ſerve his turn. So a man may ſee
whether he be a child of God, or of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38284:14"/>
Devil, even by his <hi>thoughts.</hi> I will make it
appear by theſe Reaſons:</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe <hi>mens thoughts are the free
acts of their hearts.</hi> Many times you ſpeak
not as you would, you do not as you
would, but a man <hi>thinks</hi> always as he will.
Favour of Great men, and deſire to pleaſe
them, makes men doe many times what
they would not; but <hi>thoughts are free.</hi>
I may ſay ſo, and ſo, but I will think what
Iliſt: <hi>Ergo,</hi> if thou wilt <hi>judge</hi> a man,
judge him by that he does <hi>freely,</hi> and not
by that which he does by compulſion.
But now thy <hi>thoughts</hi> are <hi>free,</hi> they are thine
<hi>own</hi> act; nothing can <hi>force</hi> thy <hi>thoughts</hi>
but thy ſelf: <hi>ergo,</hi> in them thy heart ſhews
it ſelf whether it be carnal or ſpiritual.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Peter</hi> denied his Maſter, could a
man have judged him by <hi>that,</hi> then he
might have judged him an Apoſtata: but
that was his <hi>paſſion;</hi> he diſcovered what
his <hi>fear</hi> was, not what his <hi>heart</hi> was; For
if a man might have but looked into <hi>Peters</hi>
heart, (though it was a fearfull ſin, and
without Gods mercy might have damned
him) Yet there you might have heard him
ſay, <hi>Oh it is my Maſter! Oh that I had never
come hither! It is my Maſter and Saviour,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38284:14"/>
I have none but he.</hi> It was for feare of his
life, that he denied him: For, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 7.
<hi>As a man thinketh in his heart, ſo is he.</hi> A
covetous Uſurer may make a rich feaſt, and
ſay with his tongue, Sir, you are welcome;
he muſt give good words, the ſhame of the
world and ſpeech of people will make him
do it; yet his <hi>thoughts</hi> it may be are not
towards thee. Sory thy ſelf, how go thy
<hi>thoughts?</hi> at home or abroad? Are thy
<hi>thoughts</hi> on heaven or heavenly things,
or are they below? Sure I am, if a mans
<hi>thoughts</hi> were on heavenly things, then his
heart would be there alſo; for <hi>as a man
thinks, ſo is he,</hi> Prov. 23. 7.</p>
            <p>2. As they are the freeſt acts, ſo they are
the <hi>immediate acts</hi> of the heart. Can a man
judge of the fountain by the water that
runs ſeven miles off, as well as by that
which runs immediately from it? The
water ſeven miles off, may have tincture
from the ſoyle, and ſo it may be bad there,
though good at the fountains head; <hi>ergo,</hi>
judge of the fountain by the water which
comes immediately from it. Now, <hi>thoughts</hi>
come immediately from the heart, nothing
is between them and the heart, and <hi>out of
the heart</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>proceed evil
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38284:15"/>
thoughts, &amp;c.</hi> Mark 7. 21. Other ſinnes
come from the heart too, but it is at the
ſecond, third, or fourth hand; abundance
of <hi>circumſtances</hi> come between them and
the act; as in the act of murder, it may be
there were baſe words offered, yea and
blows too, &amp;c. but <hi>thoughts</hi> come immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
from the heart: <hi>Ergo,</hi> if thy <hi>thoughts</hi>
be proud, carnal, &amp;c. ſo art thou; if thy
<hi>thoughts</hi> carry thee away in the cares of
this life, ſo is thy heart, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Thoughts,</hi> they are the <hi>continued acts</hi>
of the heart, a man is always doing them.
Can a man judge of an Uſurer, and ſay he is
liberal, becauſe he makes <hi>one</hi> great feaſt
unto his neighbours? No; but he may
ſay it is a <hi>Vſurerve feaſt,</hi> a great feaſt.</p>
            <p>By what a man doth <hi>alwayes,</hi> by that
judge him: Thou art not alwayes <hi>praying,</hi>
&amp;c. or in good company; but thou art
<hi>alwayes</hi> thinking good or evil thoughts:
thy thoughts are <hi>continued</hi> acts of thy heart.
Can a man judge a horſe for ſtumbling
once in a long journey? At ſuch a place
he went well, and at ſuch a time, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes;
yet perhaps once in a year he may
ſtumble: Can you, or will you judge him
by that? No, rather judge him by that
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38284:15"/>
which he is alwayes doing. Thou art
alwayes <hi>thinking;</hi> now that is thy <hi>God</hi>
which thou art <hi>alwayes</hi> thinking on: If on
riches, then that is thy god; or whatſoever
it be, then that is thy god.</p>
            <p>Examine then thy heart by thy <hi>thoughts;</hi>
for out of the abundance of thy heart thy
mouth ſpeaketh: yea, for one <hi>word,</hi> there
is abundance of <hi>thoughts;</hi> for one good
duty, there is abundance of thoughts; <hi>ergo</hi>
if thou wilt examine thy <hi>heart,</hi> examine
thy <hi>thoughts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. Thoughts are the <hi>Vnivocal acts</hi> of
the heart, ſuch as wherein the heart ſhews
its own nature. As for example: the
Univocal act of Light is, to lighten the
room: but now you cannot judge of the
Light by the <hi>heat,</hi> ſo well as you may by
the <hi>ſhining.</hi> So an ill ſavour muſt be judged
of by the ſtinking, which is the univocal
act of it: It cauſeth abundance of other
effects, but this is the proper act whereby
it ſhews it ſelf. So the <hi>thoughts</hi> of men are
the univocal acts of their hearts, therefore
in Scripture called the <hi>way of the heart:</hi>
juſt as the heart is, ſo are the thoughts:
if the heart be proud, ſo are the thoughts:
juſt according to the nature of the heart,
ſo are the thoughts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:38284:16"/>
5. They are the <hi>ſwifteſt acts</hi> of the
heart. If I judge of a <hi>Scholar,</hi> I will judge
him by that which he doth <hi>ex tempore:</hi>
if a fool ſtudy, he may ſpeak to purpoſe;
but look what a man doth by his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination,
that a man diſcovers himſelf to
be; Thoughts are the <hi>extempore</hi> acts of the
heart; if thy heart be heavenly, it will
ſcatter out heavenly meditations; if car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
then thy thoughts are carnal: <hi>thoughts</hi>
are as the viſions in the night, <hi>ergo</hi> we uſe
this proverb, <hi>his thoughts are gone a ſutering.</hi>
If then they be the ſwifteſt acts of mens
hearts, then are they moſt fit to expreſſe the
nature of the heart.</p>
            <p>6. Thoughts are the <hi>peculiar acts</hi> of the
heart, peculiar to God only: the world
may ſee what thy <hi>outward</hi> life is, but thy
<hi>thoughts</hi> God only ſees; neither Angel,
Devil, nor Man can ſee them: and as they
are <hi>peculiar</hi> to Gods eye, ſo he moſt regards
what mens <hi>thoughts</hi> are; and therefore the
beſt way for a man to <hi>judge</hi> himſelf, is, to
judge himſelf that way which God doth,
even <hi>by his thoughts.</hi> The <hi>Lord knowes the
thoughts of man,</hi> Pſal. 94. 11. Examine
your ſelves in this then, concerning your
<hi>thoughts,</hi> whether they be metamorphoſed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:38284:16"/>
or no: A man may ſay, he hath good
thonghts of God; but let him examine
himſelf whether it be ſo or no.</p>
            <p>7. Thoughts are the <hi>conſcional acts</hi> of
the heart; they are the greateſt accuſers,
or excuſers of the heart: they are Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
Noſe, as we may ſo ſpeak: True it is,
the words of the tongue, and the actions of
the hands, are all in the light and ſight of
the conſcience; but the nearer a thing is
unto the conſcience, the more able it is to
judge of the conſcience: And therefore
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> puts the <hi>accuſing,</hi> or <hi>excuſing,</hi>
eſpecially on the thoughts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15.</p>
            <p>We grant, a wicked man may have good
thoughts, but they are thoughts <hi>deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
not <hi>aſcending;</hi> they are caſt into the
heart by God, not raiſed out of the heart.
<hi>Moſes thought in his heart to viſit his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>
Acts 7. <hi>ver.</hi> 23. Good thoughts
<hi>grow</hi> out of the heart of the godly, they
come from the bottome of it: a wicked
man may have good thoughts <hi>caſt</hi> into his
minde, but he will fling them out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we grant wicked men may
have good thoughts; but examine whether
they be <hi>cloſe with the heart</hi> or no; all the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38284:17"/>
proper thoughts of a man are the poſſeſſions
of the heart, <hi>Job</hi> 17. 11. They take hold of
the heart, and they are at home in the heart.
Here then examine thy heart, whether the
thoughts of God <hi>cloſe</hi> with thy heart: Doth
repentance <hi>cloſe</hi> with thy heart? doſt thou
think of death, and do the thoughts thereof
make thee die daily? Or doſt thou think of
death, &amp; doſt thou not love to be holden with
that thought? Doſt thou think of hell, and
wilt thou not be holden with that thought
of hell, but thy thoughts are on thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures?
So then, if thy thoughts cloſe not
with thy heart, it is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, there may be good thoughts
in thy heart, but tis queſtionable whether
good thoughts, or no; if they come out of
<hi>due ſeaſon,</hi> it is nothing to the purpoſe: If
a Printer print never ſo well, and make never
ſo good letters; yet if he place one word
where another ſhould ſtand, he marrs all:
So, good thoughts, if they be <hi>ſeaſonable,</hi>
and in their proper place, they are the effects
of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> but if <hi>out of ſeaſon,</hi> they may
be the <hi>thoughts</hi> of Reprobates: As if thou
be at Prayer, and then to be thinking of a
Sermon, is nothing to the purpoſe. They
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38284:17"/>
muſt be ſeaſonable, and bring forth fruit
in due ſeaſon, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. 3. When thou art
at prayer, thou muſt have thy thoughts
ſuteable to prayer; for it thy thoughts be
never ſo good, yet if they be not <hi>ſeaſonable</hi>
and <hi>ſuteable</hi> to the action thou haſt in
hand, they are not actions of grace;
grace cannot away with them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, thou haſt good thoughts in
thy heart, but the queſtion is <hi>whether they
be counſelled thoughts, ſuch as thou haſt
determined to think on.</hi> Thoughts are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the counſels of a mans heart, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 5.
it may be thou maieſt ſtumble on a good
thought now and then, it may be when
thou art ſwearing, thou wilt ſay God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
me; when thou haſt been drinking
all the day, it may be a good thought ſteps
in and cries God mercy, but thou goeſt
not to <hi>ſchoole</hi> to learne the <hi>arte</hi> of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
or the ſcience of holy thinking,
or to ſay with <hi>David, O God my heart</hi> is
fixed.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Tis a wicked diſtinction to ſay that</hi>
ſome <hi>ſing are</hi> Contra legem <hi>or</hi> Praeter legem;

Gods creatures, a ſpending of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
a weakning of his parts, a ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall

ſin; ſee <hi>Eſay</hi> 65. 2, 3. &amp;c. that

And as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to <hi>Philemon,</hi> receive him
now a ſervant and more then a ſervant; hee
was a ſervant when hee was <hi>carnall,</hi> but
now being a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> he is more then a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;
if you have grace, it is an <hi>addition</hi> to
your riches, <hi>riches and more then riches;</hi> ergo
give your hearts to God, and it will be the
better for you.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>the Lord hath made thy thoughts
thy Jewels,</hi> thy thoughts are precious, the
Lord keepeth them under lock and key, hee
will not let any ſee them; if all men ſhould
obſerve a man and look into him, yet they
cannot ſee his <hi>thoughts;</hi> no; God hath lockt
them up and made them thy <hi>Jewel;</hi> wilt
thou then caſt them into the myre? wilt
thou preferred Haukes and Hounds in thy
thoughts before God? canſt thou ſit at
dinner and not once thinke of God, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
on baſe pelfe? why thy thoughts are
thy Jewels.</p>
            <p>Againe, A man that is wiſe, will be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
what <hi>companions</hi> he keepe: your thoughts
are your <hi>only</hi> companions; you never go out
nor in, but your <hi>thoughts</hi> go along with
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:38284:20"/>
you: and for this cauſe <hi>Solomon</hi> would have
us place the word of God in our thoughts,
<hi>Pro.</hi> 6. 22. See <hi>Pſal. 139. 15 16. when I am
awake I am preſent with thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men will be carefull what meat they
eate, becauſe ſuch meat as they eate
ſuch is their blood; and as their blood
is, ſo is their body; now as the body feeds
on <hi>meat,</hi> ſo doth the ſoul on <hi>thoughts;</hi> if we
look not to our <hi>thoughts,</hi> they will be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to abundance of corruptions; a man
muſt give an account of <hi>every idle word he
ſpeakes,</hi> and thoughts are the <hi>intrinſecall</hi>
words of the heart: now if men muſt give
an account of every idle word, then of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very

            <p>Let this then teach all and every one
of us in the feare of God to conſider our

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Text contains the <hi>firſt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
performed of every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
viz. <hi>to deny himſelf;</hi>
concerning which you may
here ſee,</p>
            <p>Firſt the <hi>grounds</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Secondly the <hi>reaſons</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:38284:22"/>
Thirdly, the <hi>occaſion</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the <hi>parts</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Faſthly and laſtly, the neceſſity of
it.</p>
            <p>I intend to handle theſe words as they
are in relation to the context.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>the grounds</hi> of this truth, <hi>viz</hi> that
<hi>every man muſt deny himſelfe</hi> And it is here
expreſſed to be twofold, <hi>viz.</hi> the contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
that is between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>a mans ſelfe;
mee,</hi> and <hi>himſelf,</hi> theſe two termes are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictorie
one to the other; <hi>if any man will
come after me, let him deny himſelf;</hi> theſe two
cannot ſtand together.</p>
            <p>Secondly. The contrariety that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>ſelf</hi> and <hi>ſelf;</hi> if a man be in Chriſt he
hath two ſelves; he hath a <hi>ſelf in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi>
and <hi>a ſelf out of himſelf;</hi> the ſelf in
himſelfe is <hi>old Adam;</hi> the other in Chriſt,
which is the new <hi>man;</hi> there is ſelf denying
and ſelfe-denyed; if a man will <hi>find</hi>
himſelf, he muſt <hi>loſe</hi> himſelf. <hi>Paul</hi> muſt
not be found in <hi>Paul</hi> having his <hi>owne righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,</hi>
but he muſt find himſelf <hi>in Chriſt;</hi>
for <hi>ſalvation belongeth unto the Lord Pſal.</hi>
3. 8. And <hi>ergo</hi> let him deny himſelf.</p>
            <p>Secondly, you may ſee the <hi>reaſon of it,</hi>
which is <hi>threefold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:38284:22"/>
               <hi>Firſt, Chriſts own example</hi> verſe 22. the
ſon of man muſt ſuffer, muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
Chriſt himſelf denyes himſelf;
he might have commanded himſelfe, hee
might have demanded credit, honor, or
riches, &amp;c. he might have done thus;
yet though he had no wicked ſelf, but
good ſelf, yet he denyed <hi>himſelf;</hi> and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if we will goe after Chriſt, we muſt do
to.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>here is Chriſts merit,</hi> he hath
merited this dutie; Chriſt did not humble
himſelfe <hi>for himſelfe,</hi> but he did it <hi>for us,</hi>
and therefore we may well deny our ſelves
for him. This is included in this word <hi>And.</hi>
And if I have done this for you, I would
have you doe the like for mee.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>here is Chriſts command too;</hi> let
him deny himſelf; Chriſt enjoynes this
to all that will come after him, <hi>let him deny
himſelfe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now fellows the occaſion, and that is
threefold.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Peters offence;</hi> when Chriſt had
told <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of his Apoſtles how
that he muſt ſuffer; <hi>Peter</hi> was offended
ſaying, <hi>Maſter, favourthy ſelfe;</hi> even like
a ſervant that out of love to himſelfe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:38284:23"/>
would be loth his Maſter ſhould be troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
becauſe then he thinkes himſelfe ſhall
be troubled alſo; oh ſaith Chriſt, art thou
offended at this? I tell thee, neither thou
nor any other can come after mee unleſſe
you deny your ſelves. <hi>If any man will come
after me, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Secondly, <hi>as Peter was offended, ſo alſo
were the reſt of the Apoſtles.</hi> They were very
ſorrie, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. 22. they thought to have
gotten credit in the world, and riches
and worldly preferment, and now it grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
them to heare that they muſt have a
ſuffering kinde of trade of it; <hi>ergo</hi> Chriſt
ſaid not only to <hi>Peter,</hi> but to them all, <hi>if any
man, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, <hi>like as his Apoſtles, ſo likewiſe he
did foreſee that all the world will be offended at
this;</hi> for many would faine have Chriſt and
their ſelfe-will too; but Chriſt gives a
watch-word before-hand, <hi>if any man
will, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>the parts of it.</hi> The whole
dutie is this, <hi>Let him deny himſelfe. Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi>
on the text ſaith, not onely deny
himſelfe, but in the originall <hi>deny away him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe;</hi>
not onely deny credit, &amp;c. but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre
it; if it cannot be had but with the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:38284:23"/>
loſſe of Chriſt, we muſt not only barely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſelfe reſpects, but <hi>abhorre</hi> them and
trample them under our feet.</p>
            <p>The parts of this duty are two.</p>
            <p>Firſt, let him take up his croſſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, let him deny himſelfe and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
mee.</p>
            <p>The firſt is oppoſed to <hi>ſelfe-favouring,</hi>
the ſecond to <hi>ſelfe-doing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>let him take up his croſſe,</hi> let him
not favour himſelfe; hee muſt be content
to part with ſelfe-means and maintenance,
and ſelfe ends too; he muſt be content to
part with all theſe; <hi>hee that will come after
me,</hi> muſt loſe many good friends, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
a good bit and ſweet morſell to the fleſh;
<hi>he that will come after mee,</hi> muſt not ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
theſe termes; ſuppoſe a croſſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace,
come, <hi>take it up</hi> and weare it as thy
crowne, nay thou muſt be willing to take
a croſſe before it is offered, and when thou
haſt it, thou muſt be willing to bear it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>he muſt follow me too;</hi> ones
ſelfe will doe as ones ſelfe would have him;
that is true; but you muſt <hi>follow me,</hi> not
your ſelfe; looke to <hi>me,</hi> and frame your
ſelves to walk in my ſteps, <hi>take up my
croſſe, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:38284:24"/>
Laſtly, here is the <hi>neceſſity of it.</hi> It is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
true a man may go to hell if he be ſo
minded, he may follow himſelf to hell; but
if a man tender his ſalvation, then here is an
<hi>hypotheticall</hi> neceſſity, a neceſſity with an if.</p>
            <p>Firſt, if he mean to <hi>come after me,</hi> hee
muſt take up his croſſe and deny himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if a man would <hi>ſave</hi> his life,
he muſt <hi>loſe</hi> it: if hee will <hi>loſe</hi> it, he ſhall
<hi>ſave</hi> it. If a man <hi>will</hi> keep his old relation,
he may; but if he will find credit and life in
<hi>heaven,</hi> hee muſt deny all <hi>ſelfe-reſpects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, if a man will gaine himſelfe,
let him deny himſelf. But what ſay ſome,
how ſhall we live then? how then ſhall I
hold up my head? Theſe men would faine
have the gaine of the world, but what is
a man profited, if he win the world and
loſe his ſoule? &amp;c. verſe 25. if you ſtand
upon theſe termes, if you can <hi>baulke</hi> a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
for ſelfe reſpects, you may
loſe your ſouls; but if you will ſave your
ſoules, thus you muſt doe. Again the text
ſaith, if a man be aſhamed of me and of my
word, of him ſhall the ſon of man be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med;
<hi>ergo</hi> if ever you looke that the ſon of
man ſhould not be aſhamed of you, <hi>deny</hi>
yourſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:38284:24"/>
Now for the Expoſition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deny himſelf;</hi> there is the difficulty. A
man cannot deny himſelf, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 13. for
<hi>affirmare &amp; negare</hi> are contradictions; <hi>ergo</hi>
ſomewhat muſt be meant by <hi>ones ſelf:</hi> yet
by ones ſelf is not meant the Devill, as
<hi>Micarius</hi> would have it; for ſince man
hath ſinned, ſaith he, the Devill is got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, and is as neer unto him as himſelf,
he is another ſelf within his own ſelf, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
heart within his own heart: <hi>ergo,</hi> if
he will come after Chriſt, he muſt forſake
the Devill; though this be true, yet this is
not the meaning of the text.</p>
            <p>But firſt, a mans <hi>corrupt will, wit, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
and all a mans corrupt ſelf muſt be put
off. <hi>Put off concerning the former converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the old man, &amp;c.</hi> Epheſ. 4. 22. which
is a mans ſelf. <hi>Viz.</hi> thou muſt lay aſide the
man that thou art, thou muſt not be the
ſame man if thou wilt follow Chriſt,
thou muſt be a new ſelf in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>2. Here is not only meant a mans cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
will, wit, reaſon, and affections, but
alſo <hi>all mens luſts and corruptions,</hi> all ſinnes
that cleave ſo cloſe as if they were himſelf,
as fornication, uncleanneſſe, evill concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence,
&amp;c. <hi>mortifie therefore your earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:38284:25"/>
members, Coloſ.</hi> 3. 5. the Apoſtle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
a mans luſts to as cloſe to him as his
<hi>members;</hi> for untill a man be brought
home to Chriſt, he and his ſins are <hi>all one,</hi>
he muſt <hi>deny himſelf, viz.</hi> all his luſts.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, By <hi>ſelfe</hi> is not onely meant a
mans corrupt ſelfe as ſinne and iniquity:
but alſo a <hi>mans good ſelfe in ſome reſpects;</hi>
not only ſins, but alſo <hi>Father, Mother,
Children, Friends, &amp;c.</hi> yea, <hi>life it ſelf,</hi> all,
if they be hinderances to him from Chriſt,
<hi>ſo farre</hi> he muſt deny all theſe, <hi>nay grace</hi>
it ſelf; for a man may make a God of grace,
or of prayer, &amp;c. a man I ſay muſt <hi>deny</hi> all
theſe ſo farre as they are ſtumblings and
offences in his way to hinder him from
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But oh ſayes one, my father will diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit
me, I muſt humour him, he cannot
endure a Puritan; If I muſt live as you
would have me, I ſhall never have foot of
his land; ſo the ſervant ſaies, I have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
maſter and he will turne me out of
doors if I be ſo preciſe; yea, but what
ſayes Chriſt? <hi>if you will come after me,</hi> you
muſt deny <hi>Father and Mother and all;</hi> better
it were that thy Father diſinherit thee
then that Chriſt ſhould reject thee;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:38284:25"/>
therefore you muſt <hi>deny all</hi> and <hi>take up his
croſſe</hi> and make it thine owne.</p>
            <p>And ſo I come to the words Let <hi>him
deny himſelfe;</hi> becauſe <hi>juſtification</hi> is after
<hi>regeneration,</hi> it is neceſſarie to ſhew what
<hi>ſelfe-ſeeking is,</hi> before you underſtand
what ſelfe-denyall is.</p>
            <p>By <hi>ſelfe-ſeeking,</hi> I meane a man that
hath a <hi>head luſt</hi> whereby he is ſelfe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
of himſelfe.</p>
            <p>There are five things in ſelfe-ſeeking.</p>
            <p>For firſt, <hi>ſelfe</hi> is a head luſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it's a luſt of ſelf-conceit.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, of ſelf-will.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, of ſelf-wit.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, of ſelf-confidence.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Selfe</hi> is a <hi>head luſt,</hi> it is the main luſt
that keeps men from coming unto Chriſt;
all ſeek their owne, not that which is Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſts, <hi>Philip,</hi> 2. 21. What is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?
why becauſe they ſeek <hi>ſelfe,</hi> they
follow their owne thoughts; and becauſe
they are ruled by their owne ſelves, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they art not ruled by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That it is a head luſt,</hi> I prove it by five ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
            <p>1. Becauſe it is the <hi>leading luſt to all
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38284:26"/>
luſts;</hi> no luſt in the world but <hi>ſelfe</hi> leads
the dance; why is man <hi>proud,</hi> but becauſe
<hi>ſelfe</hi> would get credit? why is a man <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous,</hi>
but becauſe <hi>ſelfe</hi> would have means
and maintenance? why is a man <hi>revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi>
but becauſe <hi>ſelfe</hi> will not put up
wrongs? Chriſt bids us of all luſts to
take heed of <hi>ſelfe, Luke</hi> 21. 34. Chriſt
knowing what a deceitfull thing <hi>ſelfe</hi> is,
he bids us have a care of ſelf-beguiling;
<hi>Take heed to your ſelves</hi> (ſaith he) for if
you do not, <hi>ſelfe</hi> will bring you into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
noyſome luſts, as <hi>ſurfeting</hi> and <hi>drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
and the <hi>cares of this life, &amp;c.</hi> and
ſo that day will come upon us unawares.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Selfe</hi> is the cauſe of all other luſts
of the heart; it is the plotter and the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
of all, it is the maſter of Arts; it was
<hi>ſelfe</hi> that found out all luſts. <hi>Selfe</hi> found
out pride, ſecurity and covetouſneſſe, and
all other noyſome luſts; <hi>ſelfe</hi> is loth to take
the paines that God would have it, and
therefore <hi>ſelf</hi> ſets his wits on the tainters,
and hence it is that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith <hi>God made
man upright, but he</hi> (viz. ſelf) <hi>hath found
many inventions,</hi> Eccle. 7. 21. Man was
upright, and God was the cauſe; He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
wicked, how? why <hi>ſelfe</hi> found out
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:38284:26"/>
many inventions. <hi>ſelfe</hi> is the inventer of
all, and when <hi>ſelfe</hi> cannot get meanes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
by that way which God hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
then <hi>ſelfe</hi> ſeekes out for credit,
wealth, pleaſure, &amp;c. then it deviſes
wayes of it ſelfe to get reputation, ſo
that <hi>ſelfe</hi> is the cauſe of luſt.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Selfe is an inluſt,</hi> it runnes along
through all the luſts of the fleſh, there is
in <hi>every</hi> luſt of the fleſh an ounce of <hi>ſelfe.</hi>
There would be no ſecurity in man but
that <hi>ſelfe</hi> would faine live at eaſe. So that
as <hi>David</hi> ſaid unto the woman of <hi>Tekoah,
hath not</hi> Joab <hi>a hand in all this?</hi> ſo may
I ſay, hath not <hi>ſelfe</hi> a hand in all this? <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas</hi>
ſaith it is called <hi>ſelfe</hi> out of an inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
love that a man bears to himſelf and
to thoſe things which ſeem good to mans
ſelfe: A man hath not onely luſt to <hi>pride,
pleaſure, &amp;c.</hi> but a man looks alſo to
things for <hi>ſelfe,</hi> either for ſome profit for
<hi>ſelfe,</hi> or credit for <hi>ſelfe; ſelfe</hi> is alwayes
an inluſt. See it in the wicked Steward,
<hi>Luke</hi> 16. he ſaid within himſelfe, &amp;c. hee
was to be <hi>turned out of his ſtewardſhip.</hi>
Now, what did he? He ſaid to himſelfe, or
within himſelfe; what ſaid he? why, he
ſaid <hi>to begge he was aſhamed,</hi> and <hi>dig hee
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:38284:27"/>
could not; ſelfe</hi> was too lazie to work, and
too proud to beg, and ſo he brought his
maſters two hundred pounds to fifty; and
what was his reaſon for it? why, ſaith he,
<hi>that they may receive me into their houſes,
verſe</hi> 2. &amp;c. and it is ſaid, <hi>the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
the unjuſt Steward,</hi> not as if he had
commended the <hi>ſinne,</hi> but as if he ſhould
ſay, I commend his <hi>wit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>It is a make luſt;</hi> a man would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
break out into luſt if it were not for
<hi>ſelfe. Doeg</hi> had a luſt of <hi>confidence</hi> in his
riches, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52. 7. and this made <hi>Eſau
comfort</hi> himſelfe againſt <hi>Jacob;</hi> hee had
a murthering luſt to comfort himſelf, <hi>Gen.</hi>
27. 42. The Jewes had a luſt of <hi>formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
to pray, to hear, to bring offerings, to
obſerve all the new Moones, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of God, ye they had no delight
in theſe things; no, their mind was on
their imaginations, they loathed the word
of God; why then would they do this?
why <hi>ſelfe</hi> was the cauſe, and they thought
thereby to ſtay themſelves upon God, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay</hi>
48. 2. And for this cauſe many amongſt
us come to <hi>Church;</hi> this is a damnable
luſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Haman</hi> would not have vaunted of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:38284:27"/>
invited to the <hi>Queenes banquet,</hi> but
that the Queene invited none but <hi>himſelfe</hi>
with the <hi>King;</hi> he would not have beene

thought he; <hi>ſelfe</hi> makes a man covetous,
injurious, and full of wrongs, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>5. As it is a make luſt, ſo it is a <hi>requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
luſt;</hi>
Other luſts are with ſome men
out of date; many reprobates cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
drunkenneſſe, nor pride, nor uſury;
theſe ſinnes are out of date; why, doth
not a man love a niggard? why, becauſe
<hi>ſelfe</hi> is not the better for him; he cannot
get ſo much as a <hi>dinner</hi> by him; many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſinnes may be out of date alſo with
men: but <hi>ſelfe</hi> is never out of date, it is
alwayes in <hi>requeſt,</hi> and ſo long as men do
well unto themſelves they ſhall be praiſed,
ſaith the Pſalmiſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. 18. he hath
none to make much of himſelfe but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.
<hi>Every man for himſelfe and God for
us all,</hi> ſaith <hi>ſelfe.</hi> But ſometime <hi>ſelfe</hi> is
out of love; but how? why hee will do
no good but unto himſelfe; this men
cannot abide; this they ſay is <hi>ſelfe</hi> out
of his wits; but <hi>ſelfe</hi> with the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:38284:28"/>
of the <hi>fleſh</hi> is alwayes in requeſt,
<hi>viz.</hi> when men will be kind to others that
they may be kind to them againe; this
<hi>ſelfe</hi> the world loves alife.</p>
            <p>2. Now I come to the ſecond, which is
<hi>ſelf-conceit;</hi> ſelf-ſeeking ſuppoſeth ſelfe
conceitedneſſe. There is a bird called S.
a faire bird, in French it is called the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils
bird, it is a black-bird, and yet it is
conceited with it ſelf that it is faire. By
<hi>S.</hi> I meane firſt the <hi>conceit a man hath of
himſelfe.</hi> What ſhall I (ſaith <hi>ſelfe</hi>) be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced
by one that goes to plough and to
cart, and ſhall I put it up? No, I am a
Gentleman, &amp;c. Another ſaith I am ſuch
and ſuch a Scholar, and ſhall I be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with ſuch a poor living? theſe men will
beare no reproofe, <hi>they will none of my
counſell, Prov.</hi> 1. 30. and <hi>therefore they
ſhall eate o the fruit of their own way, &amp;c.</hi>
verſe 31.</p>
            <p>Secondly, when <hi>a man is conceited of
himſelfe and of his owne gifts,</hi> as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
women are of their beauty, and
ſcholars of their learning. A hanſome
man, and I warrant you he knowes it;
diligent at Church, and he knowes it is
ſo, &amp;c. and he thinks his caſe the better;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:38284:28"/>
nay, you ſhall have men ſo conceited
of their parts, as that they will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
of their wicked parts, as <hi>Simon
Magus</hi> was of his Sorcerie, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 9.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, when a <hi>man is ſelf-conceited
of his actions;</hi> he doth as <hi>Siſera's</hi> mothers
Ladies did when they had given their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict
of <hi>Siſeras</hi> ſtaying; they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
conceited, oh what a wittie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
they made her; ſee <hi>Judges</hi> 5. 29. 30.
as if they ſhould ſay, we have anſwered
very wiſely; ſo a man cannot make a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
but preſently hee is conceited oh
what a learned Sermon it was; he cannot
break a jeſt, but ſtraight he is conceited,
oh what a wittie one it was; nay of
wicked actions; you ſhall hear many an old
man tell what prettie pranks (as hee calls
them) he played in his youth, and he tells it
laughingly, which is a ſigne that he is ſelf-conceited,
or elſe ſurely he would ſpeak it
wit ſhame and greife of heart.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and laſtly, <hi>ſelf-conceit is when
a man is ſelf-conceited of the eſtate he is in.</hi>
Many a man though he be the child of hell,
yet he is conceited that hee is the child of
God; who with the wretch in the Goſpel
have conceits that they love God and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:38284:29"/>
Chriſt, and therefore with him they will
come to the <hi>Sacraments;</hi> but Chriſt will
ſay to ſuch as he did to him, friends how
came you in hither? can you conceit your ſelves
to be friends? get you gon into ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
darkneſſe (<hi>ie</hi>) into hell, ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
            <p>Now if you would know what <hi>ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit</hi>
is, you muſt remember that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
<hi>foure things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, where there is ſelf-conceit, <hi>there
is no reall worth at all;</hi> hee that is ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
is a baſe man; take that for a rule.
A ſelf-conceited fellow is a baſe fellow, as
we uſe to ſay; there is no reall worth at all
in a conceited man; all the worth that hee
hath, is either <hi>reall</hi> as he thinks, or <hi>conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;</hi>
now what <hi>reall</hi> worth can <hi>ſelf</hi> have?
You know what the Scripture ſaith, tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in <hi>imaginations,</hi> and God ſcatters the
proud in the imaginations of their hearts.
<hi>Luke</hi> 1. 43. They it may be doe imagine
that they are Gentlemen, or that they
have faith, and yet God ſcatters theſe men
in their imaginations.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>as hee hath no reall worth in
himſelf, ſo hee will not ſtand to the judgement
of thoſe that can judge him.</hi> God can tell
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:38284:29"/>
the worth of every thing, but they will
not be judged by him; Gods Miniſters out
of Gods word can tell him that he hath no
reaſon to think his caſe good; but he will
not ſtand to the judgement of Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.
If a Miniſter ſhould come to a man
and ſay unto him, Sir, <hi>you are conceited that
you are a good Chriſtian, I pray what ſignes
have you for it; you pray, ſo doe Reprobates;
you heare the word and receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
ſo doe Reprobates; haſt thou no better
ſignes then theſe? no better arguments then
theſe? Why, I tell thee that a Reprobate hath
theſe and more then theſe too.</hi> A ſelfe-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
man will be judged by none but by
himſelf; A ſluggard is wiſer in his own
conceit then ſeven men who can give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 26. 16. The ſluggard is loth to
take more paines; why, he thinks he takes
paines enough, and ſo he is conceited, and
more he will not doe; let <hi>ſeven</hi> men come
and tell him that he muſt take more
pains, yet he will not, and that becauſe he is
<hi>conceited</hi> that hee doth enough. Even ſo
it is with the ſluggiſh Chriſtian, he is wiſe
in his own conceit; for let <hi>ſeven Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>
come and tell him that hee muſt take
<hi>more</hi> paines for heaven, or elſe he will never
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:38284:30"/>
come there; yet he will not <hi>beleeve</hi> them,
he is wiſer then ſo, they are fooles as hee
thinks, though hee have no reſon ſo to
thinke; he indeed is not as he ſhould bee,
and Gods Miniſters can bring reaſons out
of the Scriptures to prove it; for Wiſdom
is profitable to direct, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10. 10. But
every conceited man is a blinde man.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>A ſelf-concieted man as hee will
not ſtand to the judgement of thoſe that can
judge him, ſo he hath too high a conceit of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi>
be he never ſo little godly, he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
conceited he is a child of God; ſo
if a man have never ſo little humility or
patience, I hee come to Church, pray or
doe but a few good duties in religion, hee
thinks preſently it is as a high wall unto
him, and he ſhall goe to heaven cock ſure;
and let other men be never ſo holy, ſtrict,
religious, and pious in their waies, yet they
are apt to think them Reprobates. If he
ſee never ſo little ſlipps among them, hee is
preſently ready to ſay they are all naught;
if any be flaſe among them, hee is ready to
ſay they are all-hounds; but if him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
bee conceited that hee have never ſo
little faith, oh preſently hee thinks that is a
high wall.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:38284:30"/>
Fourthly and laſtly, <hi>hee reſteth in the
judgement of him ſelf;</hi> and this is the caſe
of thouſands in the world; they think
well of their own caſes, when they die they
ſhall goe to heaven, there is no queſtion
but Chriſt will ſave them, and from this
conceit they will never be put; let all the
Miniſters in the world come one after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
and diſcover unto a wicked man
his eſtate, yet hee will not come from his
<hi>own</hi> cenſure; for though you bray a foole
in a morter among wheat with a peſtle,
yet will not his fooliſhneſſe depart from
him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 22. So if you ſhould bray
theſe men with the threatnings of the law,
with the plagues contained in the Bible,
making theit conſciences black and blew
(as we uſe to ſpeak) yet they will not leave
off their conceitedneſſe.</p>
            <p>Now the reaſons hereof are foure.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Becauſe all ſinners are fooles;</hi> and the
fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in Gods ſight, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
5. 5. All that work iniquity are fooles;
a ſelf-conceited foole is a proverbe; and
our Saviour who knew the combination
of all ſinnes, joynes pride and fooliſhneſſe
together, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 22. a proud conceited
man and a foole are put together by our
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:38284:31"/>
Saviour. And this is the cauſe why ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thouſands in the world are conceited
of themſelves that their caſe is good when
tis nothing ſo, even becauſe they are fools;
none but fools will look more after pelf,
then jewels, and prefer <hi>tranſitorie</hi> things
before <hi>heavenly;</hi> yet ſuch are the wiſe men
of this world. That man is a fool that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
eate his meate; and ſuch is every
ſinner; his ſoule hath no food but Chriſt,
the word and his promiſes; yet he knowes
not how to feed on them; he hath no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to hide his nakedneſſe but Chriſt, &amp;c.
yet he knowes not how to put on Chriſt;
therefore he is a fool.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>men are borne fooles;</hi> of all
fooles none ſo ſelf-conceited as the <hi>born</hi>
foole; one that hath been a <hi>wiſe man,</hi>
knows how to hold his peace, but a <hi>born</hi>
foole is invincible; <hi>vain man would be wiſe,
though he be borne like a wild Aſſes colt,
Job</hi> 11. 12. Of all creatures the foal of the
Aſſe is the ſimpleſt; needs then muſt the
wild Aſſes colt be moſt ſimple. So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
a man be borne a foole, yet he
would be counted wiſe; he is <hi>conceited</hi>
that all the Miniſters in the world cannot
direct him; no, he is wiſe enough for that
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:38284:31"/>
mater; this folly is bred and borne in
him, he hath it by kind, and that is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that it is hardly clawed off, but they
are ready to ſay they are as wiſe as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
themſelves.</p>
            <p>I call not into queſtion the wits of
many; I know many of you are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
men and women; but I ſpeak
now of the Wiſdome of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and
how you may underſtand to <hi>ſave</hi> your
ſouls. What is it for a man to be <hi>worldly
wiſe,</hi> to get riches and honour, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
himſelfe like a Gentleman, and yet
a foole in ſeeking his ſalvation? this is
to be <hi>penny wiſe;</hi> but here is the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
are you not <hi>pound fooliſh?</hi> can you
go on in your ſinnes, ſwearing, &amp;c? then
ſurely you are <hi>pound fooliſh;</hi> all your
wiſdome and money availes nothing;
alas you are but penny Gentlemen. The
Sodomites, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. were blind, they
could not find the doore; they could
ſee well enough elſe, they were onely
blind in this; ſo man is <hi>ſtultus ad hoc,</hi>
wiſe enough for any thing in the world
but this; take him for husbandrie, and
his knowledge is good; for matter of
carriage he can behave himſelfe as well
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:38284:32"/>
as the wiſeſt; he is only <hi>ſtultus ad hoc,</hi>
for ſalvation he is a foole, a born foole,
and ſelf-conceited.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Men are ſelf-conceited for their owne
eſtate;</hi> thoſe that praiſe themſelves wee
uſe to ſay have ill neighbours; ſo if a
fool had a good neighbour to tell him
of his folly, and to laugh at him for it,
he would not praiſe himſelfe; ſo he that
praiſeth hmſelfe, it is certaine he hath ill
neighbours: ſo the reaſon why men are
well conceited of themſelves, is becauſe
they have ill neighbours; they think they
are honeſt, and ſo do their neighbours;
but now if a drunkard could go nowhere
but that every one would tell him that he
were a hellhound, he would not be drunk;
but an ill neighbour he tels him he need
not feare, by the grace of God he ſhall
do well enough, he is a good Chriſtian;
and hence it is that when fooles are not
anſwered according to theit folly, that
they are conceited of themſelves; when
men are ſoothed up, others thinke well
of them, and they alſo think their owne
caſes good; for ſay they, if I were not
a good Chriſtian, ſuch and ſuch would
not be acquainted with me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:38284:32"/>
Fourthly and laſtly, <hi>becuaſe the Lord
delivers many up to the ſpirit of ſlumber,
Rom.</hi> 11. 8. Black poppy ſeed will caſt a
man into ſuch a ſleep as that his eyes
ſhall be broad open, and yet he not ſee;
ſo the Lord hath caſt men into a ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
like a man betweene ſleeping and
waking; of all ſleep none like to ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
becauſe it is full of imaginations;
never is a man ſo full of dreams as then
when he is in a ſlumber. If a man were
a drunkard and in the deep of all evill,
and luld in the deep ſea of ſecurity, he
could not be ſo well conceited; but
now that his eyes are halfe open, halfe
ſhut, halfe awake, halfe aſleepe, halfe
out, halfe in, he thinkes his repentance
is good, his caſe good, and he hopes
he ſhall find mercie at the hands of God,
as well as the beſt Puritan in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh;
they are like the dreamer (as <hi>Ioſephs</hi>
brethren termed him) ſingular, in Hebrew
<hi>the Maſter Dreamer;</hi> they dreame they
ſhall have mercie, and they ſhall not
be damned, theſe men are in a ſlumber,
<hi>they have eyes and ſee not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Eſay.</hi> 28.
they ſee the judgement of God, but
<hi>perceive</hi> it not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:38284:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Conſider what a wofull caſe theſe men
are in, and how the Scripture calls this
<hi>ſelfe-conceit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, it calls it nothing but a <hi>thinking;</hi>
if a man think himſelfe to be <hi>ſomething,</hi>
he is <hi>nothing. Gal.</hi> 6. 3. to think thy ſelf a
Chriſtian, is a vain thought.</p>
            <p>2. The Scripture calls it <hi>ſuperſtition;</hi>
what a vaine thing it is for a man to be a
ſuppoſing? they ſuppoſe they ſhall goe
to heaven, they ſuppoſe they are better
then others, better then thoſe on whom
the Tower of <hi>Siloam</hi> fell; and ſo many
ſuppoſe they are not in the gall of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
not in the band of iniquity.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it calls them <hi>ſhaddowes;</hi> they
walk in a vain ſhew <hi>Pſal. 39. 6. viz.</hi> their
repentance ſhewes as if it were good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.
They can ſpeak lowly, there
is a ſhew that they are humble. Man
walks in <hi>vain</hi> ſhew, like a Tradeſman who
hath abundance of things which he makes
ſhew of, yet are none of his own; ſo hee
talkes of <hi>grace</hi> which was never his own.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, it calls them <hi>imaginations,</hi> Acts
4.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, it calls them <hi>appearances, Matth.</hi> 6.
16. So men appeare all at a Sermon, but
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:38284:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their hearts never lie down before the
Word, there are nothing but ſeemings,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. Thus you may think your ſelves
or ſuppoſe your ſelves to be in good caſe,
when as it were better thou didſt appeare
to be a hell-hound then a Chriſtian, and
not be ſo indeed; for then there were ſome
hope that thou wouldſt look out. If a
man be ſick, yet if he ſeem to be well, none
will look out for him as they would doe
if he ſeemed to be ſick indeed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this is the moſt dangerous ſickneſſe;
ſo if men did ſeem to be damned wretches,
that they were borne and continue in ſin,
and when they dye they muſt be damned,
if men feared thus, they would look out.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>conſider ſo long as thou art well
conceited of thy ſelf, Chriſt hath no commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to call thee;</hi> and Chriſt will doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but what he hath <hi>commiſſion</hi> to doe,
he will not runne into a <hi>Praemunire;</hi> Chriſt
doth proteſt to all the world that hee hath
no <hi>commiſſion</hi> from his Father for ſuch; <hi>I
am not came to call the righteous,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi>
9. 3. <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe that are <hi>righteous</hi> in their
owne eſteeme and thoughts, but are not;
if a man tell them that they are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for hell then for heaven, they are
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:38284:34"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

               </gap>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:38284:35"/>
better-conceited of themſelves then ſo;
if a man tell them for all their profeſſion
they may be hell-hounds, yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
better of their profeſſion then ſo;
now then conſider what a caſe thou
art in, if thou bee out of Chriſts road.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>as Chriſt hath no commiſſion, ſo
he is glad he hath not,</hi> and he gives thanks
to his Father that he put him not into
commiſſion, I thank thee O Father, &amp;c.
<hi>Luke 10. 21. q. d.</hi> thou doſt not convert
thoſe that are <hi>ſelf-conceited,</hi> thoſe that
think they ſhall not be damned, ſuch as
conceit that they need no ſummons, that
are righteous enough; Father, I am glad
of it, &amp;c. and it is ſaid there that Jeſus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced,
&amp;c. I rather rejoyce that thou haſt
ſent me to poor ſouls, ſuch as are the off-ſcouring
of the world, &amp;c. but he that is
<hi>ſelfe-conceited,</hi> is wiſer forſooth then ſo;
Chriſt tels thee that thou muſt <hi>take up</hi>
his croſſe; but thou thinkeſt that thou haſt
more wit, thou canſt goe a wiſer way
to worke; thou haſt an eaſier way to
heaven, thou wilt none of the Croſſe;
and I tell thee then that Chriſt will
none of thee, but he wIll be glad to
ſee thee damned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:38284:35"/>
Fourthly and laſtly, he is in the broad
way to hell that is ſelfe-conceited; there
be many wayes to hell; the covetous
goes one way, the Drunkard goes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
there are a thouſand wayes to
hell; though there by ſundry wayes to
hell, yet they all meet in <hi>ſelfe-conceit,</hi>
there is the broad high way where all
meet; <hi>ſelfe-conceit</hi> is not only the way
to hell, but it is the <hi>broad way</hi> where
all wayes meet. <hi>There is a way</hi> (ſaith
the wiſe man) <hi>that ſeems right, &amp;c.
Prov. 14. 12 but the end of it is death;</hi>
there is the wages, there all the wayes
meet. Oh then examine your ſelves.
I ſhould give you <hi>ſignes</hi> and <hi>tokens</hi> to
make it appeare unto you; but the time
will not give me leave. I will only name
one or two. That man that ſelfe-ſweares,
is conceited of himſelfe, that is one ſigne;
As I am an honeſt man, As God ſhall
help me, by my faith and troth, As I
looke that the Lord ſhould ſave my
ſoule, &amp;c. theſe men are highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited
of themſelves, they think that
their ſalvation is ſure, yea ſo ſure that
that they may ſweare by it, but theſe
are devilliſh and damnable ſelfe-conceits;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:38284:36"/>
it is Gods prerogative only <hi>tr ſweare by
himſelf,</hi> Heb. 6. l3, 14. I ſpeak this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I know it is a common practiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men, and a helliſh brand of a curſed
ſelf-conceited man.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ur Saviour CHRIST being
demanded by one of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
<hi>how they ſhould pray;</hi> He
here teaches them theſe two
things. Firſt, a <hi>Platform of prayer,</hi> in the
2. 3. 4. verſes; Say, <hi>Our father, &amp;c.</hi>
Secondly, he teaches them the <hi>importunity
of Prayer,</hi> which he ſets forth by the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
of a man who having a gueſt
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:38284:38"/>
come to him at midnight, and had nothing
to ſet before him, he went to his friend to
intreat him to lend him three loaves,
and at the firſt he nakedly intre<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ts, Lend
me three loaves: The door is ſhut, ſayes
his friend, and I cannot open it now. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
he falls to intreat and to beſeech
him to do him this favour, He had a gueſt
come to him, and he knew not what to do:
Why, 'tis <hi>midnight,</hi> ſayes he, is there no
other time to come but now? Thirdly,
he begins to <hi>knock,</hi> he muſt needs have
them, though it beat an unreaſonable hour.
Why, I tell you I am in bed. Then he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats
him as a friend. Friend me no
friends, ſayes he again. Yet the man would
not leave knocking: at laſt with much
adoe the man riſes, ſaying, Will you never
be anſwered? and he lends him three
loaves, becauſe of his <hi>importunity.</hi> Now,
ſaith our Saviour, <hi>I ſay unto you, though he
would not give him as a friend, yet becauſe of
his importunity he will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſimilitude is this: Thou art <hi>that
man,</hi> oh Chriſtian <hi>ſoul,</hi> this gueſt is thy
ſelf: Now then come home to <hi>thy ſelf</hi>
with the <hi>Prodigall,</hi> who when he was come
to himſelf, goes to his <hi>father and friend.</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:38284:38"/>
This friend is Chriſt, that thou art to pray
unto; theſe three loaves are <hi>grace, mercy,</hi>
and <hi>peace:</hi> Theſe thou art to pray for;
it may be Chriſt anſwereth thee in thy <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi>
It is <hi>midnight,</hi> thou commeſt too
late, there is no <hi>mercy</hi> for thee. The ſoul
<hi>prayes ſtill,</hi> Oh Lord awaken and help me:
it may be the Lord will anſwer thee by
<hi>terror</hi> in thy ſoul, The door of mercy is
ſhut, thou ſhouldeſt have come rather.
Yet Lord, open unto me, ſayes the ſoul:
Nay, ſaith the Lord, all my children have
mercy already; now mercy is aſleep, I have
converted them already; they came in
due ſeaſon, thou commeſt at <hi>midnight,</hi>
there is no mercy for ſuch a hell-hound as
thou art. Up Lord, have mercy on me,
ſayes the poor ſoule, and look on me, &amp;c.
Look me no looks, ſaith the Lord; I came
to ſave the <hi>loſt ſheep</hi> of the <hi>houſe of Iſrael:</hi>
there was a time when I would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<hi>thee,</hi> when I called unto <hi>thee</hi> early
and late: But now I am aſleep, and my
mercy is aſleep, it hath been awake as long
as it could well hold open its eyes; and
commeſt thou <hi>now?</hi> Oh the ſoul cries ſtill,
and will never give over: if mercy be to
be had at the throne of grace, he will have
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:38284:39"/>
it. Even as a begger being at a gentlemans
door, they bidding him be gone, there is
nothing to be had: nay, ſayes the begger,
I will not be gone, here is ſomething to be
had, and I will have ſomething, or elſe I
will die at the door: The gentleman hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him ſay ſo, thinks it would be a ſhame
for if him if he ſhould <hi>die</hi> at his door, and
gives him ſomewhat: So when the ſoul is
thus <hi>importunate,</hi> becauſe of importunity
it ſhall be granted. Verily I ſay unto you,
if you <hi>thus</hi> aske, it ſhall be given unto
you.</p>
               <p>Theſe words contain in them the <hi>main</hi>
duty of <hi>importunate</hi> prayer. <hi>Ask;</hi> if ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
will not ſerve turn, <hi>ſeek;</hi> if ſeeking
will not ſerve turn, then <hi>knock:</hi> try all
meanes.</p>
               <p>Another parable our Saviour put forth,
<hi>Luke 18. 1, 2. that men ought alwaies to
pray, and not to faint.</hi> There was a poor
woman wronged by her adverſary, and
there was no Judge to right her but a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
one, ſo that ſhe had but poor hopes;
yet ſhe reſolves to go, or elſe ſhe ſhall be
undone; therefore if ſhe periſh, ſhe will
periſh at his feet. He cals her all to nought.
Oh, for Gods ſake help me, ſayes ſhe. I
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:38284:39"/>
care not for God nor man, ſays the Judge:
Nay, good my Lord, ſaith the woman.
The Judge ſeeing her thus importunate,
ſaid, I ſhall be troubled with her if I do her
not juſtice. <hi>How much more</hi> (ſaith the text)
<hi>ſhall not God avenge his elect that cry day and
night?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>obj.</hi> But ſome man may demand, what
is <hi>importunate prayer?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, it is a <hi>reſtleſſe</hi> prayer, which
will take no nay, nor contumelious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe,
but is in a holy manner <hi>impudent</hi>
untill it ſpeed; and there are in it foure
things:</p>
               <p>Firſt, it is <hi>reſtleſſe:</hi> he that is importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
cannot reſt till he ſpeed in his ſuit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God: as the poor woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
ſhe ſought the Lord God of heaven and
earth, (ſhe was of the curſed ſtock of <hi>Cham</hi>
whom the Lord commanded to deſtroy;
yet ſhe repented, and became of the faith
of <hi>Abraham</hi>) to ſee if the Lord would own
her: but the Lord ſeemed to reject her,
and ſuffer'd the devil to poſſeſſe her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Now, what, might not this poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
think ſhe had made a ſorry change
of religion, ſeeing that God the author of
of it would not own her, but ſuffered the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:38284:40"/>
devil to poſſeſſe her daughter. But ſee the
<hi>importunity</hi> of this woman, ſhe would not
be quiet untill ſhe had found Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi>
7. 24, 25. Chriſt could not be hid. No?
What, could he not hide himſelf in ſome
corner? No, no, thinks ſhe, there is a
Chriſt, and if he be to be had under the
cope of heaven, I will have him. Even ſo
it is with the ſoul that is <hi>importunate</hi> in
prayer, it is reſtleſſe. What if Chriſt do
hide himſelf in the Word, &amp;c. and will
not owne a poor ſoule; yet the poor ſoule
knowes there is a Chriſt, and if he be to be
found in the whole world, he will have
him: I will, ſaith he, turn over all duties,
I will go to all the Miniſters that are neer,
I will uſe <hi>all the means.</hi> Now Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be hid from ſuch a ſoule that is thus
importunate.</p>
               <p>Now as it is a Prayer that will take no
<hi>nay,</hi> ſo firſt it will take no <hi>privative nay</hi> of
ſilence; Secondly, no <hi>poſitive nay</hi> of denial.</p>
               <p>Firſt, no poſitive nay of ſilence: A
man that is importunate in prayer, muſt
and will have ſome anſwer; he is not like
<hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, that could get no anſwer,
1 <hi>King.</hi> 18. 26. nor like wicked men that
pray in their pewes, they know not what,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:38284:40"/>
nor whether God hears them or no: but
an importunate prayer will have an <hi>anſwer,</hi>
like the woman of Canaan: <hi>Have mercy
on me O Lord</hi> (ſaid ſhe); but <hi>Chriſt anſwered
not a word.</hi> Hath ſhe done then? No, ſhe
cries ſo much the more; <hi>Have mercy on me
ô Lord:</hi> yea ſhe was ſo importunate, that
his Diſciples were aſhamed to heare her;
yet ſhe cryed, <hi>Have mercy on my daughter;</hi>
the devil hath my daughter, and miſery
will have me, unleſſe thou with have mercy
on us. Chriſt anſwered her never a word.
It was much trouble to her to have her
daughter vext with a devil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but this trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
her much more, that Chriſt in whom
all her hopes was, would not hear her, nor
lend her one look. What? might ſhe think,
Is this the mercifull Saviour, that is ſo full
of pitty and compaſſion? Is this he that
hath made proclamation to all the world,
ſaying, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary,
&amp;c?</hi> and I am tyred and wearied by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the devil that poſſeſſes my daughter
&amp;c. yet he regards me not. Thus ſhe might
have ſaid: yet theſe diſcouragements
could not put her off, but <hi>ſhe cried ſo much
the more,</hi> yea ſo that the Apoſtles were
aſhamed that Chriſt ſhould let her ſtand
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:38284:41"/>
on that faſhion; yet ſhe ſtood it out, and
prevailed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it will taken no <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of
denial: For when ſhe had an <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and
that flat againſt her, it was like bellowes to
the fire, ſhe was to much the more infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
ſhe doubles her forces, <hi>Have mercy
on me ô Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt put her off with a
denial, <hi>I am not ſent but to the loſt ſheep of
the houſe of Iſrael;</hi> I come for <hi>ſheep,</hi> not for
<hi>goats;</hi> you are of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> on whom
I have ſet a brand of damnation, a <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of ſervants,</hi> a ſlave of hell and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
Theſe are all of your blood; but
I come to ſave them of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
But the denial of an <hi>importunate</hi> ſoul is like
the ſtop in a paſſage of water; the more it
is ſtopt, the more violent it is: ſo this
poor woman is ſo much the more eager
with Chriſt; ſhe did but <hi>crie</hi> before, now
ſhe <hi>worſhips</hi> him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. 25. as if ſhe
ſhould have ſaid, Lord help me now, I am
one of thy <hi>loſt ſheep;</hi> I confeſſe I am a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanite,
I am of that damned blood; yet
Lord help me; I am perſwaded that thou
canſt take a courſe whereby to help me,
Thou canſt caſt ſome mercy on a Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anite.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:38284:41"/>
Thus you ſee, an <hi>importunate</hi> ſoul will
toke no denial, but will renew its forces at
the Throne of grace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>an importunate prayer will
take no contumelious repulſe;</hi> ſuppoſe God
ſhould anſwere never a ſyllable of thy
prayer, yet thou wilt pray; ſuppoſe he
doe anſwer, and that againſt thee, yet
ſtill thou wilt pray, Nay ſuppoſe he
call thee all to nought making thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
tell thee of all thy ſins and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations,
making thee think that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is ſhut up againſt thee, and God
hath ſhut his eares, calling thee Dog,
hell-hound, and wretch, &amp;c. yet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can breake thee off if thou be <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate</hi>
indeed. So this woman was
not beaten off with Chriſt ſending the
Devill into her Daughter, nor with
Chriſt hiding himſelfe when ſhe ſought
him; nor with Chriſts anſwering never
a word, nor with the Apoſtles frumps,
nor with his denyall, nor contumelious
repulſe, for he called her <hi>dog,</hi> verſ. 26.
Hence dog, I had as lieve fling my mercy
on a dog, as on thee. What creature but
an <hi>importunate</hi> one, could have gone ſo
far? But ſee here the nature of <hi>importunity,</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:38284:42"/>
it gets within Chriſt and takes advantage:
ſhe confeſt the cauſe, ſaying, <hi>Truth Lord,</hi>
thou haſt hit me right, I am a dog, or a
wicked woman; let me then have the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
that dogs have; though dogs may
not be equal with children at the table, yet
they may wait under the table: I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that thy children are ſo plentifully
fed, that ſome <hi>crummes</hi> fall from the table,
therefore let me have the <hi>priviledge</hi> of a
dog. <hi>Naaman</hi> the Syrian was a dog, as well
as <hi>I; Rahab</hi> the harlot was a dog, as well
as <hi>I; Ruth</hi> a dog, as well as <hi>I;</hi> yet theſe
got crummes: truth Lord, I am a dog,
yet thy mercy can metamorphiſe a dog:
Of theſe <hi>ſtones</hi> thou canſt raiſe <hi>children</hi> to
<hi>Abraham.</hi> Thus it is with an importunate
ſoul; though God call it all to naught,
and caſt all ignominious terms upon it, as,
I had as lief thou ſhouldeſt offer me ſwines
blood, as to ſpeak in my hearing; yet if
thou be <hi>importunate,</hi> thou wilt beare any
contumelious repulſe.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>an importunate prayer is in an
holy manner:</hi> And as an impudent begger
that is needy, counts it no manners to hold
his peace from begging, although he be
bidden; Or as a poor petitioner to the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:38284:42"/>
King, the King bids him hold his peace,
yet he will not, but ſtill he goes on: The
officers ſay, Thou filthy fellow, wilt thou
never have done? doſt thou not ſee that
the King is angry? Yet he ſtill cries, Help
me Lord, ô King. So the Canaanitiſh
woman, or an Importunate prayer, is an
<hi>impudent</hi> prayer, yet in a <hi>holy</hi> manner.</p>
               <p>I remember a ſtory of a poor woman in
<hi>Eſſex</hi> condemned to die: ſhe falls to cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ſcreeching, as if ſhe meant to pierce
the heavens; the Judge and thoſe on the
bench bid her hold her peace: O my Lord,
ſaid ſhe, it is for my <hi>life</hi> I beg, I beſeech
you, it is for my <hi>life.</hi> So when a ſoul comes
before God, and begs for mercy, he muſt
conſider that it is for his life, O Lord it is
for my life. Now though the Lord will
not anſwer, and though he call the ſoul
all to nought, letting it go up and down
with a heavy heart; yet the ſoul crying
out, 'Tis for my life; if I muſt go to hell,
I will go to hell from the throne of grace,
weeping and wailing for my ſinnes, and
catching hold on the horns of the altar:
this ſoul ſhall find mercy.</p>
               <p>I have wondered at the ſtory in the 5.
chapter of <hi>Luke,</hi> it is a ſtrange paſſage,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:38284:43"/>
where this godly kind of impudencie was
ſeen. Our Saviour Chriſt was preaching
in the houſe to the people, and there was a
poor man that could not tell how to come
to Chriſt; ſo the poor man got ſome to
lift him up to the top of the houſe, and to
untile it, and ſo to let him down; now the
rubbiſh could not chooſe but fall either on
Chriſts head, or on the heads of ſome of
his hearers; Was not this impudent
action? could not this man have ſtayed
untill the ſermon had been ended? But
<hi>importunity</hi> hath no manners: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he did interrupt Chriſt, yet Chriſt
asked him not why he did ſo, but ſayes,
<hi>Man, be of good comfort, thy ſins be forgiven
thee.</hi> Let us therefore come with boldneſſe
unto the Throne of grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 16.
with freedom to talk any thing; Not as
if God had given us leave to be irreverent,
but as to a loving generous man, of whom
we uſe to ſay, He is ſo kinde, you may ſay
any thing unto him; come to him at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
he will riſe up and hear you, or what
buſineſſe ſoever he be about, yet he will
hear you. Even ſo it is with God: he is
ſuch a God that all poor ſouls may be bold
before him to ſpeak what they will, they
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:38284:43"/>
may lay open their caſes, and ſhew their
eſtates. Now when ſoules come boldly,
and give the Lord no reſt till he eſtabliſh
them, <hi>Eſai.</hi> 62. 7. then ſaith God, How
now, cannot I be at reſt for you? &amp;c.
This <hi>holy</hi> kind of impudencie is in prayer,
and it will give the Lord no reſt.</p>
               <p>Reaſons <hi>why wee muſt ſeek importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately,</hi>
are three.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>in regard of Gods majeſty,</hi> he
loves to be ſought unto, and it is fit he
ſhould be ſought unto. Among men, we
account it a matter of too much ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe
to be <hi>much intreated;</hi> and we uſe
to ſay <hi>he loves to bee intreated;</hi> this is a
fault among men; yet for all this, <hi>Quis
veſtrum, &amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeaks, what man
of us can be content to be but once, or
ſleightly entreated? when a man comes to
intreat a kindneſſe of a man there is
<hi>Ifing and Anding</hi> and <hi>ſhall I, &amp;c.</hi> nothing
but <hi>importunitie</hi> can get a kindneſſe of a
man; and this is a ſinne among men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
men are bound to doe good; but
the Lord is not bound to us. If we ſinne,
he is not bound to pardon us therefore;
the Lord being a God of majeſty, lookes
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:38284:44"/>
to be <hi>ſought unto</hi> of us for his mercie,
and he lookes that wee ſhould be impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate;
and hence it is that God ſaith
<hi>I will give you a new heart,</hi> Ezechiel
36. I will vouchſafe you all theſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
yet <hi>I will look to be inquired for of
you.</hi> verſe 76. I will look that they ſhall
ſend to me for theſe things.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe a man ſhould need a 1000
pound; What, ſaith the gentleman, doth
he think a Thouſand pound is nothing?
<hi>I</hi> will have good ſecurity for it. So when
we come for ſuch high mercies as theſe,
for ſuch infinite compaſſions; theſe are
ſomewhat, and God looks to be <hi>ſought
unto</hi> for them; and Chriſt the ſon of God
is a great heire, and thoſe that are faulters
to him, muſt be <hi>importunate</hi> with him, if
they mean to be at peace with him.</p>
               <p>If one will marry a rich heir, who hath all
the preferment &amp; dignity that the country
can afford, he looks to be well ſued unto.
So the Lord Jeſus is a great heire, heire of
the whole world; if thou goeſt to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
unto him, thou muſt ſue unto him, and
he looks for <hi>prayer,</hi> he loves to heare his
children crie: this is one of his titles,
though he be a God, yet he is <hi>the hearer of
prayer,</hi> Pſal. 65. 2.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:38284:44"/>
Again, we have wronged his Majeſtie.
Suppoſe thy ſervant wrong thee, thou wilt
ſay thou wilt pardon him, but firſt thou
wilt make him humble himſelf unto thee,
he ſhall &amp; muſt know that be hath wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a good maſter: So God is willing to
pardon thee, but yet he will make thy
bowels know that thou haſt ſinned againſt
a good God; he will make it appeare by
thy prayer, he will make thy ſpirit melt,
he will fill thy face with ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
he will make thee know what a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
God thou haſt rebelled againſt, or
elſe the Lord will never pardon thee. Doeſt
thou think to pacifie God with a <hi>lazie</hi>
prayer, with comming to Church and
ſaying, Have mercy upon me, moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
Father? Doeſt thou think that the
Lord will have mercy upon thee for this?
No, no, he may ſend thee quick to hell
for all this; he will make thee cry and cry
again with groans; he will make thee cry
out and pray on another gates faſhion,
and he will make the ſoveraignty of his
mercy to be ſeen in thy ſalvation: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in regard of Gods majeſty, he loves
men ſhould be importunate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:38284:45"/>
Secondly, in regard of Gods <hi>mercy;</hi> it
is a diſgrace for Mercy to be begged <hi>fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidly;</hi>
'tis a diſgrace to Gods bounty, for
a man to beg it with <hi>lukewarm</hi> importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.
What makeſt thou of the mercy of
God? doſt thou think that it is not worth
a <hi>groan,</hi> with the running over of a <hi>Pater-noſter?</hi>
doeſt thou make Gods mercy of
ſuch baſe reckoning? this is a diſgrace to
Gods goodneſſe, to be ſo cold or frigid in
prayer. Thou haſt offered many offerings,
yet I ſcorn them, ſaith God, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 43. 23.
Thou haſt not honoured me with them,
thou haſt not called on me, thou haſt been
weary of calling on me, thou haſt too ſhort
a breath in thy prayers, thou careſt not
how ſoon thou commeſt to an end? Do
you come and lay <hi>lazie</hi> prayers upon my
altar? Thou haſt not honoured me.</p>
               <p>It was a cuſtome among the Romans,
when any was condemned to die, if he
looked for mercy, he was to bring father
and mother, and all his kinſmen and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
and they ſhould all come with
teares in their faces, and with tattered gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and kneel down and beg before the
Judge, and cry mightily; and then they
thought Juſtice was honoured. Thus they
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:38284:45"/>
                  <hi>honoured</hi> juſtice in man, for a man condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to die; and ſo the Lord loves his mercy
ſhould be <hi>honoured,</hi> &amp;c. and therefore he
will have prayer to be <hi>importunate,</hi> that it
may appear by <hi>groans</hi> how <hi>highly</hi> we eſteem
of grace; our ſoules muſt pant and gaſp
after grace, the breath of the Lord being
the ſoul of our ſouls, our hearts will die
without it: This is to the <hi>honour</hi> of mercy,
therefore the Lord will have us <hi>impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>as importunity muſt be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of Gods mercy, ſo it muſt be in regard of
our ſelves,</hi> elſe we cannot tell how to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem
it: Soon come, ſoon gone; lightly
gotten, ſuddenly forgotten; I have it,
come let us be jovial and ſpend it, when
this is gone, I know where to have more.
But if he had wrought for it, and alſo muſt
work for more, if he meant to have more,
he would better eſteem it. The world lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
eſteems Mercy; what's the reaſon?
The greateſt covetous men are they that
once were poor; when a poor man hath
gotten ſtore of riches, he is more covetous
then he that was borne to hundreds or
thouſands; they are careleſſe of it, and
ſpend laviſhly, whilſt a covetous mans
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:38284:46"/>
teeth water at it; and the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they come lightly by it. Therefore
the Lord loves that we ſhould come <hi>hardly</hi>
by our mercy; not as if he <hi>ſold</hi> mercy for
our <hi>pains,</hi> but for our good: yet we are
not capable of it. See <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 9. where the
Lord ſpeaks thus to his people: <hi>They ſhall
come with weeping, and with ſupplication
will I lead them.</hi> This is a fine phraſe,
God <hi>leads a ſoul</hi> up and down with ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
before he grants his requeſt; juſt
as a begger on the high-way, a gentleman
comming by, he begs of him, the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
goes on his way as if he took no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice,
but the begger goes on crying, For
Gods ſake (ſir) beſtow ſomething on me;
yet he goes on ſtill, till at laſt the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
comes to his houſe, and then he gives
him his deſire. Even ſo God <hi>leads</hi> a ſoul up
and down from one good duty to another,
till he have brought the ſoul to that paſſe
that he would have it to be, and then he
hears it, and ſayes, What is thy ſuit? I will
pardon thee.</p>
               <p>What then is the reaſon, may ſome man
ſay, why ſo few are <hi>importunate</hi> in prayer?</p>
               <p>I anſwer, firſt, becauſe <hi>men count Prayer
a penance:</hi> there is a naturall kind of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:38284:46"/>
in mens breaſts; the Papiſts, when
men ſin, their Prieſts enjoyn them penance,
as pilgrimages and ſcourgings, ſo many
<hi>Pater-noſter's,</hi> and ſo many <hi>Ave-Marie's,</hi>
where they reckon Prayer to be a penance.
This naturall Popery is in mens breaſts;
they count Prayer laborious unto them,
and they are weary of it, they are not
eager upon prayer, they look not on Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
as a bleſſing, but as a <hi>yoak;</hi> behold what
a weariſome thing it is, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 13. They
were <hi>weary</hi> of the ſervice of God; Oh,
ſay they, that the Miniſter would once
have done! they had rather be in an Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
or about their buſines; all good
duties are as <hi>penance</hi> unto carnal men. If a
man be to do <hi>penance,</hi> he cares not how litle
he does of it; a Rogue cares not for too
much whipping.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Men content themſelves with
formality.</hi> Many men <hi>pray,</hi> as <hi>Haman</hi>
ſpake the Kings words before <hi>Mordecai,</hi>
for he had rather have led him to the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
than to have ſaid, <hi>Thus ſhall it be done
unto the man whom the King will honour:</hi>
but he thought it would be the worſe for
him if he ſpake them not, and therefore he
only ſpake them for <hi>forme.</hi> And ſo men
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:38284:47"/>
for the moſt part go to church, to hear the
Word, to Pray, to receive the Sacraments
&amp;c. even for <hi>forme,</hi> or becauſe it is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion,
and they think if they do not thus
and thus, they ſhall not be ſaved.</p>
               <p>You ſhall have the Drunkard ſay, I am
ſorry for my drunkenneſſe; but he lies;
for the next day he will be at the Alehouſe
again: ſo the Whoremaſter ſayes, Lord
I am ſorry that I have ſinned againſt thee;
but he lies; for the next Quean that he
meets with, having opportunity, he falls
to whoreing again: So the Covetous man
will ſay, I am ſorry I am ſo full of earthly
thoughts; yet he lies; he is not ſorry;
for you ſhall have him carking and caring
all the day long, and he hath a thouſand
proclamations in his head; He only prayes
for <hi>form</hi> with the reſt, they only <hi>ſay</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
they <hi>pray</hi> not. I deny not <hi>ſaying</hi> of
prayer, if they <hi>pray;</hi> Our Saviour Chriſt
ſaith, When you pray, ſay <hi>Our father.</hi> The
proud man diſhonours Gods name, ſaying,
<hi>Thy will be done;</hi> whereas he ſhould be
<hi>humble,</hi> for that is Gods will; it is Gods
will he ſhould be <hi>zealous,</hi> yet he prayes
not: He ſayes, <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes,</hi> &amp;c.
but he prayes not ſo; for he wrongs his
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:38284:47"/>
neighbour, and his neighbour wrongs him,
and he does not forgive thoſe that treſpaſſe
againſt him. He ſayes, <hi>Lead us not into
temptation;</hi> but he prayes it not; for he
runs preſently into <hi>temptations,</hi> and hath
no care to avoyd them. And this is the
reaſon why men are not <hi>importunate,</hi> viz.
becauſe they do make <hi>formality</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>becauſe they are Gentlemen-beggers.</hi>
Of all the beggers in the world,
I would be loth to meet with a <hi>gentleman-begger,</hi>
for he is the proudeſt of them all;
if a man tell him that he hath been an <hi>ill
husband,</hi> and hath abuſed himſelf, preſently
he ſets his hands to his ſide, ſaying, I am
not as every begger, I am <hi>thus and thus</hi>
deſcended, <hi>I</hi> am as good a man by birth as
your ſelf: a gentleman-beggers heart will
not ſtoop. So men are <hi>gentlemen-beggers</hi>
to God, they were (ſay they) borne of
Chriſtian parents, and they have been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
the children of God already; What,
are none the children of God, but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of Puritans? We are deſcended as
well as the beſt of you all. Theſe are proud
and not as yet brought to a <hi>ſenſe</hi> of their
own miſery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:38284:48"/>
When <hi>John</hi> did preach to, and baptize
the Scribes and Phariſees, he calls them all
to nought, O ye <hi>vipers</hi> and full of poiſon,
<hi>who hath forewarned you to flee from the anger
to come?</hi> Viper, ſay they? Viper in thy
teeth; we are the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
we are better deſcended then ſo; we are
Believers, and do you call us <hi>Vipers?</hi> then
indeed we might crie out, Oh we are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned!
then we had need to crie for mercie.
And in this ſenſe, men are <hi>Gentlemen-beggers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another reaſon why men are not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate,
is, becauſe <hi>they have wrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
of Prayer.</hi> I will tell you the ſundry
conceits of men,</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>they have high conceits of their own
prayers;</hi> they cannot pray in a morning,
between the pillow and the blankets, half
aſleep and half awake, but they think that
they have done God good ſervice; ſo that
he cannot afford to damne them: At
night he ſaies, <hi>Lord have mercie on me,</hi>
and ſo goes to ſleep, and then he thinks
God muſt keep him untill the morning:
So when he goes to dinner, he ſaies, <hi>Lord
bleſſe theſe creatures unto us,</hi> and ſo falls a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board,
and he thinks that God muſt needs
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:38284:48"/>
ſanctifie them unto him; and after ſupper
he goes to prayer, and ſo to bed, and thinks
that he ſhall be heard for his much babling
ſake, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. they think God will have
mercy on them. But poor ſoules, if they
knew how <hi>unſeemingly</hi> they prayed, how
<hi>unfitly,</hi> and what want there is in <hi>ſeeing</hi>
their own eſtate, they would ſay, is this
to pray for my ſoul, for ſuch infinite mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie?
Lord, how do I abuſe the throne of
grace? how do I abuſe thy ſabbaths, thy
houſe, thy name, and all the holy ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
which I go about? A man that is
<hi>importunate</hi> in prayer, is aſhamed; but
when they think <hi>highly</hi> of their prayers,
they are inſolent, their prayers are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and they too.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>as men have high conceits of
their prayers, ſo they have mean conceits of
their ſinnes,</hi> they think not their ſinnes ſo
bad as they are. Theſe men are like <hi>Abner,</hi>
who ſaid, <hi>Let the young men ariſe and play
before us,</hi> 2 Sam. 2. 14. They account mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a ſport, and dancing and muſicking
little worſe then <hi>Davids</hi> playing on the
harp; <hi>Amos</hi> 6. 5. And if they commit
adulterie, they ſay that's but a trick of
youth; if they tell a lie, it is only at a dead
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:38284:49"/>
lift when they have no other ſhift. That
man that doth not think of every ſinne he
commits, as <hi>David</hi> did of his, even to make
his heart to <hi>ake</hi> for it, that man ſhall never
ſpeed well before God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>as men have mean thoughts of
their ſinnes, ſo they have baſe thoughts of
God.</hi> They cannot think that God ſhould
damne a man for <hi>drinking a pot with his
friend;</hi> I cannot think God will be ſo
ſtrict; No, no, I love God with all my
heart, ſay they; and they think that God
is of their mind; and if they were as God,
they would not be ſo ſtrict. So, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.
<hi>They thought I was ſuch a one as themſelves;</hi>
they think God will pardon them, and
therefore becauſe of this, men are not <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate</hi>
with God. God hath ſent me a
croſſe (ſaith one) but I hope to rub it off
well enough. Why? <hi>God will not keep his
anger for ever,</hi> Jer. 3. 5. Suppoſe a man be
abſent from Church, or break out into
ſome unſavoury ſpeech, will God be angry
for this? Suppoſe a man be negligent in a
good duty, will God require every dayes
work? Tuſh, tuſh, God will not, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
10. 13. A company of Puritans ſay he
will, but I know he will not: and hence
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:38284:49"/>
it is, that men will not be <hi>importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, becauſe <hi>they have wrong conceits
of importunity.</hi> If a man knock once or
twice, or thrice, and none anſwer, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
he will be gone; this is for want of
manners; thou wilt knock ſeven times, if
thou be <hi>importunate</hi> with them: They
within may ſay, Hold thy peace, be gone,
&amp;c. but thou wilt not ſo be anſwered.</p>
               <p>Beloved, men are cloſe-handed, they
are loth to give; and they are cloſe-hearted
too, they are loth to take the pains to <hi>ask</hi>
of <hi>God;</hi> they are loth others ſhould be
be <hi>importunate</hi> with them, and therefore
they are loth to be <hi>importunate</hi> with God.
Examine your ſelves then in this duty;
for <hi>importunate prayer is ever more the prayer
of an importunate man.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O proceed then: There be ſix
ſignes to know whether our
Prayers be <hi>importunate,</hi> or
no.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>importunate prayer is evermore
the prayer of an importunate man;</hi> and the
man is importunate, if his praier be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate:
But how can a <hi>man</hi> importune
God for mercy, when his <hi>perſon</hi> impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:38284:52"/>
God for vengeance? It muſt be the
prayer of a <hi>godly</hi> heart; <hi>Preſerve my ſoule,
for I am holy.</hi> Pſal. 86. 1, 2. <hi>David</hi> makes
a prayer, and he was <hi>holy</hi> when he made it;
his prayer could tell him that he was one
that labored to work in holines. Therefore
when thou goeſt to God in praier, conſider,
whether thou canſt ſay, <hi>Lord hear me, for
I am holy,</hi> and I would fain be <hi>holy:</hi> but
if the ſaying of theſe words choak thee,
then thy prayer <hi>condemns</hi> thee.</p>
               <p>Of all begging, it is a great matter <hi>who
it is</hi> that begs at the door: <hi>Who is that,</hi> ſaith
the indweller? and when he opens the
door and ſees it is a <hi>thief,</hi> &amp;c. Oh, <hi>is it you,</hi>
ſaies he; you may ſtand long enough,
you ſhall never have alms of me. So in
praier, it is all in all <hi>who it is</hi> that prayes.</p>
               <p>The woman in the Goſpel having an
iſſue, touched our Saviour; he looking
about, asked <hi>who touched him;</hi> and when
he ſaw the woman, Oh is it you, ſaies he,
bee of good chear, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. 48. So when a
man prayes to God, <hi>Who is that,</hi> ſaies God,
that would have theſe mercies? And when
the Lord ſees it a Drunkard, or a covetous
man, &amp;c. <hi>is it you?</hi> ſaies the Lord; you
may ſtay till Dooms-day, and yet never
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:38284:52"/>
find mercie. The ſpirit of ſupplication
and the ſpirit of prayer, is called the ſpirit
of grace, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. If then thou haſt
not the ſpirit of <hi>grace,</hi> thou canſt not <hi>pray.</hi>
The text ſaith not, Whoſoever asketh the
Father in my name, but, whatſoever <hi>you</hi>
ask the Father in my name? there is many
a man may uſe the name of Chriſt at the
throne of grace, but certain it is none but
thoſe that are in Chriſt can pray, and with
them every thing operates. A man that
will walk with God in obedience to his
laws, muſt be a holy man: hence is that
ſaying of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 15. 7. a place
fit for the purpoſe; <hi>If you abide in me, and
my word abide in you, &amp;c.</hi> as if he ſhould
have ſaid, You may ask what you pleaſe,
&amp; intreat God all the daies of your life; yet
unleſſe <hi>you abide in me,</hi> you cannot ſpeed.
That man that walks not in <hi>holineſſe</hi> of life,
can never be an <hi>importunate</hi> orator as was
<hi>Moſes</hi> the man of God; but a wicked mans
prayer (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaks) is <hi>tanquam
latratus canum,</hi> &amp;c. no betrer then the
barking of dogs, or the grunting of ſwine:
therefore you whoſe <hi>conſciences</hi> tell you
that you live in ſin, your praiers never
ſpeed at the throne of <hi>grace</hi> for <hi>eternal mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:38284:53"/>
Secondly, <hi>an importunate praier is the
praier of a pure conſcience.</hi> Suppoſe a man
doth not ſee that he lives in ſin, yet if his
conſcience crie guilty, if he have a foul
conſcience, his praier never prevails with
God. <hi>If I regard wickedneſſe in my heart,
the Lord will not hear my praier,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi>
Pſal. 66. 18. that is, if I can ſay, or my <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience</hi>
can tell me that I <hi>regard</hi> iniquitie in
my heart, the Lord will not hear me. A
man muſt have a <hi>pure</hi> conſcience, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi>
1. 3. elſe let him not look God in the face
beg he may, but he ſhall never <hi>ſpeed</hi> as long
as he goes on with a conſcience that can tel
him he <hi>regards</hi> iniquitie.</p>
               <p>There be many <hi>pray,</hi> (for indeed their
conſcience will make them <hi>pray</hi>) but they
may <hi>pray</hi> till they come to hell, yet they
ſhall never be delivered, if there be but
<hi>one</hi> ſin unrepented of.</p>
               <p>I remember a ſtorie of a poor woman
being troubled in conſcience, and many
Miniſters uſing to viſit her, at laſt came
one which (after much talk and praying)
hit upon one ſin which ſhe was guilty of,
and loth to part with; Then the woman
cried out, Till now you have ſpoken to the
poſt, but <hi>now</hi> you have hit the mark, my
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:38284:53"/>
                  <hi>conſcience</hi> tels me I have been loth to part
with <hi>this</hi> ſin, but I muſt leave it, or elſe I
cannot be ſaved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mala conſcientia bene ſperare non poteſt.</hi>
The Pagans had ſo much divinitie, as to ſay
<hi>The gods muſt be honoured with puritie;</hi>
therefore they wrote on the doors of their
temples, <hi>Let none having a guilty conſcience
enter this place,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Importunate prayer is evermore
a prayer that is full of ſtrong arguments.</hi>
And hence it is that <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will fill my
mouth with arguments,</hi> Job 23. 4. like an
importunate man, who will bring <hi>all</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and arguments to <hi>effect</hi> his cauſe; even
ſo an importunate man at the throne of
<hi>grace,</hi> will bring <hi>all</hi> arguments to perſwade
God. If a man be to pray for any <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi>
grace, he will bring <hi>all</hi> the arguments
he can deviſe to get it; as, Lord, it is a
grace of the Covenant, for the want
whereof I endure many temptations; thou
haſt made me a Miniſter, I cannot work
on mens conſciences untill I have it; he
preſſeth all arguments he can deviſe. A
good <hi>orator</hi> before God, muſt be a good
<hi>logician.</hi> It was noted of the High-Prieſts
that were to pray before God, they were
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:38284:54"/>
to have <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> and that was
two parts of Logick, <hi>viz.</hi> knowledge and
perfection: ſuch a one ſhould a Miniſter
be, he muſt be a good Logitian at the
throne of grace.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>importunate prayer is a ſtout
prayer;</hi> Continue in praier, ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,
<hi>Col.</hi> 4. 2. a <hi>weak-hearted</hi> praier is a
<hi>cold</hi> praier, a praier without a ſpirit; yet
theſe men that have weak ſpirits to <hi>pray,</hi>
have ſtrong enough to ſin, and wit enough
to ſin, and knowledge enough to ſin; but
bring them to grace, then they have no
<hi>ſtrength.</hi> Thou canſt not ſtrive to prevail
with God, unleſſe thou <hi>ſtand</hi> to it. How
came <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>prevail</hi> with God, but by
<hi>wreſtling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Prayer is called <hi>fighting,</hi> it is a
holy kind of <hi>violence.</hi> Thou canſt not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a mercie at Gods hand, unleſſe thou
lay all thy force on it. Even as a Father
who hath an apple in his hand, and his
child would fain have it; he firſt opens
one finger, then another, till the apple drop
out. So is it with a poor ſoul at the throne
of grace: the Lord opens his hands, and
fills all things living with plenteouſneſſe;
What is the meanes that is uſed? why,
the praiers of his children; they by their
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:38284:54"/>
praiers open Gods hand, and ſo make the
bleſſings to deſcend. Go for grace; why,
the Lord will ſay unto thee, Thou art
proud, thou muſt be humble, <hi>and ſo open
that finger;</hi> Thou art careleſſe, thou muſt
go quicken thy ſelf, <hi>and ſo open that finger:</hi>
God ſaies, thou wilt not make much of <hi>this</hi>
grace when thou haſt it, but thou wilt turn
it into a wantonneſſe; then thy ſoul muſt
learn to <hi>mortifie</hi> its members, <hi>and ſo open
that finger;</hi> thou canſt not get grace at
Gods hand, unleſſe thou do <hi>open all his
fingers,</hi> and then it will fall down. There
is a ſeverall power in all Gods children,
ſome have more, ſome have leſſe, yet all
muſt be <hi>powerful,</hi> elſe none can <hi>prevaile</hi>
with God.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>if thou pray importunately, thou
praieſt wakefully;</hi> he muſt be deeply awake
that <hi>praies;</hi> his ſoul, his heart, his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
muſt be awake: that man that
praies drowſilie, praies not powerfullie;
<hi>Watch</hi> therefore, ſaith Chriſt, and <hi>pray,
Luk.</hi> 21. 36. Watch to pray. <hi>q. d.</hi> for as
there is a ſleepie <hi>head,</hi> ſo there is a ſleepie
<hi>heart.</hi> As a Begger who is begging, is all
awake, head, feet, hands, &amp;c. all is awake
to beg; ſo muſt that ſoul be that means to
ſpeed in praier.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:38284:55"/>
Sixthly, <hi>importunate praier is an aſſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance-getting
praier;</hi> a praier that will not
be quiet till it have got aſſurance that
God hath heard it. Wicked men <hi>pray,</hi> and
preſume that God hears them, but God
hears them not; nay, many of Gods dear
children <hi>pray</hi> many times, and are not
heard. <hi>How long wilt thou be angry with thy
people that praieth?</hi> Pſ. 80. 4. Not only with
their <hi>perſons,</hi> but with their <hi>praiers</hi> alſo.
How then, think you, is the praier of ſuch
as live in their ſins taken? who <hi>pray,</hi> but
their praiers vaniſh away in the aire like
clouds: theſe may <hi>pray</hi> and <hi>pray,</hi> but they
get nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Behold he praies,</hi> ſaith the voice to <hi>Saul</hi>
Act. 9. 22. What, did he not <hi>pray</hi> before?
Yes, he had made many a long praier, elſe
he could not have been a Phariſee; but
now he did not onlie <hi>pray,</hi> but he praied
unto <hi>God</hi> as <hi>David</hi> did, who did <hi>lift up
his heart to God,</hi> Pſal. 25. 1. or elſe his heart
could not have praied; and then in the
next verſe <hi>David</hi> begins his praier. Our
hearts are juſt like a bell, which ſo long as
it lies on the ground will make no muſick,
till it be lifted up; Our hearts are not like
the bell of <hi>Rochea,</hi> which (<hi>they ſay</hi>) will
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:38284:55"/>
ring of its own accord; but our hearts
muſt be lifted up, elſe they will make no
delightful muſick in the eares of God.
Wherefore if you <hi>pray,</hi> and labour not to
bring your hearts home to God, that ſo
he may hear them in mercie, he will (<hi>it
may be</hi>) heare them, but it will be to
your <hi>condemnation,</hi> as he hears the praiers
of wicked men: therefore if thou praieſt,
pray ferventlie.</p>
               <p>There be ſix or ſeven marks of Praier
that is not importunate, and he that praies
ſo, may go to hell, for ought I know.</p>
               <p>The firſt is a <hi>lazie</hi> praier; An impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
man works hard to bring up his
ſuit; his underſtanding, his counſel, and
all his policie works: ſo if the ſoul be <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate,</hi>
then it is a <hi>working</hi> praier. Praier
is a labour, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. Labour with me in praier.</hi>
That man that plowes his field, and digs
his vineyard, <hi>that man</hi> praies for a good
harveſt; if a man <hi>pray</hi> to God never ſo
much, yet if he do not uſe the <hi>meanes,</hi> he
cannot obtain the thing he praies for. Even
ſo it is with grace; A man may <hi>pray</hi> for all
the graces of Gods ſpirit, and yet never
get any, unleſſe he labour for them in the
uſe of the means. God cannot abide lazie
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:38284:56"/>
beggers, that cannot abide to follow their
calling, but if they can get any thing by
begging, they will never ſet themſelves to
work. So, many there be, that if they
can get <hi>pardon</hi> of ſin for <hi>begging,</hi> then they
will have it; but let ſuch know that the
Lord will not give it for ſuch lazie kind of
praying; but if thou wilt have pardon of
ſin, thou muſt labour for it, thou muſt get
it with thy fingers ends; God gives not
men Repentance, Faith &amp;c. by <hi>miracles,</hi>
but by <hi>means:</hi> Thou muſt then uſe the
<hi>means,</hi> and keep watch and ward over
thine own ſoul, that ſo thou maieſt get the
grace thou praieſt for.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>a praier that is not a full praier
never ſpeeds with God;</hi> but an importunate
praier is a <hi>full</hi> praier, it is a <hi>pouring</hi> out of
the heart, yea of the <hi>whole</hi> heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. 8.
the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>poure out your hearts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him,</hi> truſt in him at all times, poure out
your hearts (the addition is made in the
Lamentations of Jeremie) <hi>like water.</hi> It
may be thou poureſt out thy <hi>praier</hi> like
tar out of a tar-box, half ſticking by the
ſides; but when thou praieſt, thou muſt
out with <hi>all</hi> before God. When thou gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt
thanks, doſt thou labour to remember
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:38284:56"/>
all the bleſſings of God? when thou doſt
petition to God, doſt thou poure out <hi>all</hi>
thy heart before him? doſt thou caſt all
thy care on God?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Snatch-prayer is no importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
prayer;</hi> when men pray by ſnatches,
or peecemeals, by breaking off a limme of
their praier, becauſe of ſluggiſhneſſe, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
their hearts are eager about other
buſineſſe; it is not good to truſt <hi>fits</hi> of
devotion; 'tis a baſe kind of <hi>praying,</hi> when
men <hi>gallop</hi> over their praiers, that ſo they
may come to an end <hi>quickly.</hi> Should I
accept this at your hands, ſaith God by
his Prophet? when they brought a ſheep,
it wanted a lim, they were loth to give
God a whole offering, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 13. Many
pray a peece of a praier in the morning,
and then they go after the world; he
down's on his knees, and gives God a rag
of a praier, a companie of ragged ends;
And God counts it an indignitie; <hi>ſhall I
accept</hi> this (ſaith he)? What, a lame
praier? No, no, the Lord looks for a <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
that hath its full growth; it is a ſhame
to ſpeak in the congregation what men do
in <hi>ſecret</hi> before God, which many have
confeſſed after they have been converted,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:38284:57"/>
how they have gone into <hi>Gods preſence,</hi>
and have ſhuffled over their praiers, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every houre ſeven, untill they had
done.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Silent praiers are never im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate.</hi>
I mean by <hi>ſilent</hi> praier, when a
man is <hi>ſilent in that which God looks he ſhould
moſt inſiſt upon.</hi> David made a praier,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. and the Lord looked that he
ſhould ſtand much upon his <hi>adulterie</hi> and
<hi>murther</hi> which he had committed, to ſee
what ſhame he took on him for it; but he
ſhuffled it over: and what ſaith the text?
<hi>When I kept ſilence;</hi> what, did the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>roare,</hi> and yet <hi>keep ſilence?</hi> theſe are
contradictions. Yea, the Prophet <hi>roared,</hi>
and <hi>kept ſilence;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, the
Lord counted his praier but roaring, ſo
long as he laid not open <hi>that</hi> ſinne which
the Lord lookt he ſhould have ſtood on;
the Lord let him roare, and roare he might
long enough, but (ſaith he) I <hi>brake my
ſilence,</hi> I ſaid I will confeſſe my tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and then thou forgaveſt the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of my ſin. So many go to God, and
tell God they muſt needs have mercie, and
fain they would have mercie, and yet they
are <hi>ſilent</hi> in <hi>confeſſing</hi> the <hi>ſinne</hi> they ſhould.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:38284:57"/>
I ſay, the Lord will never hear that man;
he may <hi>pray</hi> to God all his life, and yet go
to hel in the end. Haſt thou been a <hi>drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi>
and doſt thou think that the Lord will
forgive thee for crying, <hi>Lord forgive me
&amp;c?</hi> No, no, thou muſt <hi>inſiſt</hi> on it, and
ſay, <hi>Againſt thy word I have been a drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard;
my conſcience told me ſo, but I would
not heare; I haue felt the motions of thy holy
ſpirit ſtirring againſt me, and I regarded not;
Now if thou ſhouldeſt turn me into hell, I
were well requited; ſo many Sermons have I
neglected; I have wronged others in this kind,
and I have been the cauſe why many are now
in hell, if they repented not. I have praied for
mercie, yet with the dog to his vomit have I
returned, and therefore for all my praiers
thou maieſt caſt me into hell for ever; and
now I haue praid, yet it is a hundred to one
but I ſhall run into my old ſin again; yet as
I expect forgiveneſſe, ſo I deſire to make a
covenant to give over all my ſinful courſes,
and I am juſtly damned if I go to them again.</hi>
Such a kind of praier the Lord loves.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Seldome praier is no importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
praier;</hi> when the ſoul contents it ſelf
with ſeldome comming before the throne
of grace; an importunate ſoul is ever <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting</hi>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:38284:58"/>
the way of mercie, and the gate
of Chriſt; he is often at the threſhold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, in all praier and humiliation.</p>
               <p>The reeling'ſt Drunkard in the world
ſometimes can do ſo too; the baſeſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer
in the world ſometimes can be
chaſte: the Devil is quiet ſo long as he is
pleaſed, and the wicked may ſometime
have a <hi>fit</hi> in praier. But this is the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of an importunate heart, he is <hi>frequent</hi>
at the throne of grace. The Propher <hi>David</hi>
praied <hi>ſeven times</hi> in a <hi>day;</hi> and <hi>Hannah
continued</hi> in praier night and day.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Lukewarm praier is not an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
praier;</hi> when a man praies, but is
not <hi>fervent,</hi> when a man labours not to
winde up his ſoul to God in praier. That
man that praies <hi>outwardly</hi> only, that man
teaches God how to denie his praier.
Though you make many praiers, ſaith
God, yet I will not hear you; <hi>why?</hi> Your
hands are full of blood. <hi>Qui frigidè orat,
docet negare.</hi> They are like luke-warme
water, that never boils out the blood: So
they have been guiltie of murder and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of other ſinnes, and they did indeed
<hi>pray</hi> againſt them, but they were never but
luke-warme, they never boiled away the
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:38284:58"/>
blood of their ſins. Thou muſt pray <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently,</hi>
with a ſeething-hot heart, if thou
meaneſt to get <hi>pardon</hi> for all thy ſinnes, as
ſecuritie, and deadneſſe of heart, &amp;c. And
as it is <hi>Jonah</hi> 3. let every man crie <hi>mightily</hi>
unto the Lord.</p>
               <p>Seventhly and laſtly, <hi>Bie-thoughts in
praier, keep praier from being importunate;</hi>
as when a man praies, and let his heart go
a wooll-gathering. I remember a ſtorie of
an unworthy Oratour, who being to make
an acclamation, <hi>O earth! O heaven!</hi> when
he ſaid <hi>O heaven,</hi> he looked <hi>down</hi> to the
earth; and when he ſaid <hi>O earth,</hi> he looked
<hi>up</hi> to heaven. So, many when they <hi>pray</hi> to
God in heaven, their thoughts are on the
earth: theſe praiers can never be impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate.
When a man praies, the Lord looks
that his heart ſhould be <hi>fixed</hi> on his praier;
for our hearts will <hi>leake,</hi> and the beſt child
of God, do what he can, ſhall have bie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts in praier:</p>
               <p>And that,</p>
               <p>Firſt, from <hi>corrupt nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, from <hi>nature curbed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, from <hi>Sathan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, from a <hi>mans own ſluggiſhneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:38284:59"/>
For the firſt; The beſt children of God
have <hi>corrupt natures,</hi> and when they have
done what they can, diſtractions will faſten
on them. They would performe good
duties better, if they were able, ſaying
with Paul, <hi>The good which I would, I do
not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>from Nature as it is curbed;</hi>
The more grace binds nature to its good
behaviour, the more ruſtling it keeps.
Even as a Bird being at <hi>libertie</hi> keeps no
ſtir, but being in a <hi>cage,</hi> it flutters about,
becauſe it is abridged of its libertie: ſo
when thou haſt curbed thy corrupt fleſh,
it will be skittiſh in every good dutie thou
goeſt about; and hence it is that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
uſeth this phraſe, viz. <hi>I find another
law in my members rebelling againſt the law
of my mind,</hi> &amp;c. When grace <hi>curbs</hi> the
law of ſinne, then nature <hi>rebels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>from Satan;</hi> as in <hi>Job,</hi> Satan
ſtands at his right hand as a <hi>Plaintiffe,</hi> as
<hi>Aegidius</hi> compares it, which puts in all
Caſes to hinder the <hi>Defendant;</hi> Even ſo
the Devil puts in all bie-thoughts that he
can deviſe, to hinder a mans ſuit for going
on before the throne of grace. But thou
muſt do as <hi>Araham</hi> did, when he was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:38284:59"/>
when the birds came, he drave
them away; ſo muſt thou do by they bie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts,
if thou wilt have fruit of thy ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
before God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they come from <hi>ſpiritual
ſluggiſhneſſe</hi> that creeps on the beſt, if they
take not heed: And this was the reaſon
the Apoſtle cryed, <hi>O wretched man that I
am,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I ſpeak not now to the children of God,
who are troubled w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> bie-thoughts in their
praiers; For they, the more bie-thoughts
they have, the more earneſt they are in
praier; they <hi>mourn,</hi> with <hi>David,</hi> in their
praier. Conſider ô Lord (ſaith he) how I
<hi>mourn,</hi> Pſal. 55. There was ſomething in
the Peophets praier that did <hi>vex</hi> him, and
that made him ſo much the more to mourn
before God.</p>
               <p>But as for you that can have bie-thoughts
in praier, and let them abide
with you, your praiers are not importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate;
the Heathen ſhall riſe up againſt you
and condemn you.</p>
               <p>I remember a ſtorie of a certain Youth,
who being in the temple with <hi>Alexander</hi>
when he was to offer incenſe to his god,
and the Youth holding the golden Cenſer
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:38284:60"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>

                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:38284:61"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:38284:62"/>
with the fire in it, a coal fell on the Youths
hand and burnt his wriſt; but the Youth
conſidering what a ſacred thing he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
for all he felt his wriſt to be burnt,
yet he would not ſtir, but continued ſtill
to the end.</p>
               <p>This I ſpeak to ſhame thoſe that can let
any thing, though never ſo ſmall, to diſturb
them, yea (if it were poſſible) leſſer things
then nothing; for if nothing come to
<hi>draw</hi> their hearts away, they <hi>themſelves</hi>
will employ their hearts. <hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ls</hi> Prieſts
ſhall condemn theſe, who did cut them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with knives, and all to make them
<hi>pray</hi> ſo much the more ſtronglie. What a
ſhame is it then, that we ſhould come on
<hi>life and death</hi> to pray for our ſouls, and yet
come with ſuch looſe and lazie praiers!
Think you that a malefactor when he is
crying at the Bar for his life, will be think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on his Pots and Whores, &amp;c? Was it
ever heard of, that a man at <hi>deaths</hi>-doore,
ſhould be thinking on his Dogs? can he
then think on them? Do you think that
<hi>Jonah</hi> prayed on this faſhion, when he was
in the Whales belly? or the Thief on the
croſſe, or <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lions den, or the
three Children in the fierie furnace, or
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:38284:62"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> in priſon? Do ye think that theſe
<hi>prayed</hi> thus? What, ſhall I be at prayer,
and my minde in the fields? No, no;
if I will <hi>pray,</hi> I muſt <hi>melt</hi> before God, and
bewail my ſins, and be heartilie affected in
<hi>prayer.</hi> But as long as I pray thus, I pray
not at all. And as God ſaid to Adam, <hi>where
art thou?</hi> ſo may he ſay to thee, <hi>Man, where
art thou?</hi> art thou at <hi>prayer,</hi> and thy mind
at <hi>mill?</hi> is thy mind on thy Oxen, and
art thou at prayer before me? what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity
is this? Should a man come to ſue
to the King, and not minde his ſuit? will
not the King ſay, Do you mock me? know
you to whom you ſpeak? The Lord takes
this as a hainous ſin, when men come into
his preſence with ſuch looſe hearts.</p>
               <p>Now ſeeing theſe things are thus, take
a word of exhortation to labour for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
Prayer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prayer is the art of all arts;</hi> it enables a
man to all other duties, it is the art of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
&amp;c. <hi>Samuel</hi> confeſſed, if he had
not had the <hi>art</hi> of Prayer, he could not
have had the art of Preaching, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.
23. See the antitheſis between theſe two
words. <hi>God forbid;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay,
God forbid that I ſhould ceaſe to pray for
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:38284:63"/>
you, for then I ſhould not teach you the
right way. A Miniſter can never preach
to his people, that <hi>prayes</hi> not for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
It is the <hi>art</hi> of Thankſgiving; a man
cannot be thankfull, if he cannot <hi>pray.
Pſal.</hi> 116. 12. It was the meanes whereby
the Prophet <hi>David</hi> would be thankfull to
God; he would <hi>take up the cup of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and call on the name of the Lord.</hi> A
man hath not a good ſervant, unleſſe he
can <hi>pray</hi> for his maſter; ſee the ſtorie of
<hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. Prayer helps
to perform all other good duties. How
doſt thou thinke to have benefit by the
<hi>Word,</hi> unleſſe thou be fervent in <hi>prayer</hi>
with God to get a bleſſing upon it. We
can do nothing but by begging.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as Prayer is the <hi>art of all arts,</hi>
ſo it is the <hi>Compendium of all divinitie.</hi>
Therefore to <hi>call zealouſlie</hi> on the name
of the Lord, is to be a Chriſtian; <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
ſhall call on the name of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.
It includes repentance, humiliation, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for ſin, joy in Gods goodnes, thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving
for mercies, obedience to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
yea the whole dutie of man;
therefore we muſt labour to be importunate
in prayer. A <hi>Reaſonable</hi> ſoul is <hi>eminently</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:38284:63"/>
all ſouls; ſo Prayer is <hi>eminently</hi> all good
duties. <hi>Pſal. 72. The prayer of David the
ſon of Jeſſe;</hi> that is, all his repentance, in
all paſſages; he did humble himſelf before
God; all <hi>Davids</hi> duties are included by
the name of the <hi>prayer</hi> of David the ſon of
Jeſſe. And therefore thou hadſt need to
make much of Prayer; for thou canſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>repent,</hi> unleſſe thou <hi>pray</hi> well.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Prayer is a mans utmoſt refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence;</hi>
a man cannot have Chriſt, but only
by Prayer. 'Tis bad enough for a man to
be a Drunkard, or to live in any other ſin;
but yet after all this, if a man have the
<hi>ſpirit</hi> of <hi>prayer,</hi> there is hope of this man;
if after all his ſinnes committed, he can
<hi>pray</hi> to God, there is hope. But for a man
to ſinne, and not to be <hi>importunate</hi> in <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
is dangerous. What ſaith the Pſalmiſt?
They are corrupt and become abominable,
they have not called on the name of the
Lord, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 14. 4. Oh fearfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition!</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Prayer is that which Gods
people have, though they have nothing elſe;</hi>
it is the beggers diſh (as I may ſo call it.)
A begger hath no way to live, but by beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
thererefore he had need beg hard:
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:38284:64"/>
ſo we have nothing to <hi>live</hi> on but <hi>praying;</hi>
I mean nothing that is to be done on our
ſide; all the <hi>promiſes</hi> of God are to be
gotten by <hi>prayer.</hi> Suppoſe a man have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to live on but his fingers ends, no
houſe nor land, nothing left to maintain
his wife and children, but his fingers ends;
will he not be toyling all the day? he is a
day-labourer, as we uſe to ſay. So, to <hi>pray</hi>
earneſtly, is a Chriſtians fingers ends.
When a houſe ſtands but upon <hi>one</hi> pillar,
will not a man be fearfull and carefull of
that pillar? why, Prayer is a mans pillar;
iſ this be gone, down falls all the hope of
ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Prayer is that which hath the
command of Mercie;</hi> we are ſuch unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
ſervants, that Mercie will not meddle
with us, unleſſe it be commanded. Patience
is loth to beare; we have ſo provoked God
that Mercie is loth to make or meddle with
us; for unleſſe it have <hi>command</hi> from <hi>God,</hi>
it will not admit of any ſoul. When <hi>David</hi>
begged for loving kindneſſe, he was <hi>impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate;</hi>
elſe mercie and loving kindneſſe
would not look on <hi>David,</hi> Pſal 42. 8.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>Prayer is Gods delight.</hi> The ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of the wicked is abomination to
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:38284:64"/>
God, but the prayer of the upright is his
delight, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 8. The Lord muſt have
ſomething to pleaſe; Kings (you know)
muſt be pleaſed; ſo the King of heaven
would be <hi>pleaſed</hi> by all that come unto
him. Now nothing is more pleaſing unto
him then prayer.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>Importunate praier is a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
prayer.</hi> There be many that pray to
God for mercie, and yet they are loth to
have it; why? becauſe they are not <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate.</hi>
When a mans luſt runs on the
world and worldly pleaſures, &amp;c. he <hi>ſpeeds</hi>
not. When the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> was
<hi>importunate,</hi> Chriſt ſaith unto her, <hi>Woman,
be it unto thee as thou wilt:</hi> ſhe had a will
to grace, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 28.</p>
               <p>Eightly, <hi>Importunate prayer is the only
faithfully prayer.</hi> A begger never goes away
from a gentlemans door, ſo long as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
he ſhall have an alms: ſo, as long as
a ſoul is <hi>importunate</hi> with God, it is a ſigne
that it is a <hi>believing</hi> ſoul. <hi>O woman,</hi> (ſaith
Chriſt) <hi>great is thy faith.</hi> Why? Becauſe
her <hi>importunitie</hi> was great, therefore
Chriſt concludes her faith was great.</p>
               <p>The means to get <hi>importunitie</hi> in prayer,
are theſe:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:38284:65"/>
Firſt, <hi>Labour to know thine own miſery.</hi>
See <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 18, 19, 20. They could not
have prayed importunately, unleſſe they
had known how it had ſtood with <hi>Paul;</hi>
ſo unleſſe thou <hi>know</hi> thy miſerie, thou canſt
not be <hi>importunate.</hi> If a Drunkard, or
Whoremaſter, or Sabbath-breaker, or
Swearer, &amp;c. <hi>knew</hi> that they ſhould be
<hi>damned,</hi> they would get out of their ſins.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>You muſt be ſenſible of your
miſerie. Simon Magus</hi> knew his miſerie,
yet becauſe he was not <hi>ſenſible</hi> of it, he
ſayes, <hi>Pray ye to the Lord for me,</hi> Act. 8. 24.
If he had been <hi>ſenſible,</hi> he would <hi>himſelf</hi>
have fallen down before the congregation,
and he would have confeſſed how he had
committed that ſinne, in a more apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
manner.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Obſerve the prayers of Gods
people,</hi> as here the diſciples of Chriſt did;
they hearing Chriſt pray, ſay unto him,
<hi>Maſter, teach us to pray;</hi> they were ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
with Chriſts prayer, that they ſaid,
Oh that we could pray thus! Oh that we
had ſuch a ſpirit! <hi>Maſter, teach us</hi> to pray.
So I ſay, conſider Gods people, how they
pray; they can pray as if they would <hi>ſoare</hi>
up to God in ſupplication; they pray as if
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:38284:65"/>
they would <hi>rend</hi> the heavens. If men
did but <hi>conſider</hi> this, it would quicken
them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Get a ſtock of prayer.</hi> That
man muſt needs be rich, that hath a ſtock
in <hi>every market.</hi> So if a man have a <hi>ſtock</hi> of
prayer, it is a ſigne he is like to ſpeed, as
I <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 2. If God did lend his ears to the
Corinthians when they were crying for
Paul, then certainly Pauls prayers were
importunate.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>If thou wilt be importunate,
labour to be full of good works. Qui benè
operatur, bene orat;</hi> as <hi>Act.</hi> 10. Cornelius
his alms and prayers were come up to God:
now if he had committed drunkenneſſe,
<hi>that</hi> had come up to God with his prayer;
therefore was it happy for <hi>Cornelius</hi> that
he was full of <hi>good works;</hi> ſo thou canſt
not be importunate, unleſſe thou be full
of good works; take heed that ſwearing,
and lying, &amp;c. crie not <hi>louder</hi> in Gods
eares then thy prayers.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>If thou wilt be importunate in
prayer, labour to reform thy houſhold.</hi> VVhen
<hi>Jacob</hi> was to call on God, he ſaid to his
houſhold, Put away your ſtrange gods,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 35.</p>

               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>COLOSS. I. 10.</bibl>
                  <q>That you might walk worthy of the
Lord unto all pleaſing, being fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
unto every good work.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is a <hi>double</hi> ſenſe in theſe
words:</p>
               <p>Firſt, wherein we may not,
not cannot walk <hi>worthy</hi> of
GOD.</p>
               <p>And ſecondly, there is a ſenſe, wherein
we may, and muſt walk worthy of
Him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:38284:68"/>
The firſt ſenſe, wherein we cannot walk
worthy of God, is twofold.</p>
               <p>Firſt <hi>We cannot walk worthy of God,
with an abſolute worth of exact proportion;</hi>
for in this ſenſe the Angels of heaven can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
walk <hi>worthy</hi> of God: they bleſſe God
and praiſe him unceſſantly; but God is
above all bleſſing and praiſe, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. 5.
Their holineſſe &amp;c. had a beginning; but
God is <hi>infinite.</hi> Oh then, how much leſſe
can we walk worthy of God!</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>We cannot walk worthy of
God, with a ſinleſſe worth of a mortified con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie,</hi>
ſo worthily as we might have
done if we had not had ſinne; for we are
compaſſed with the fleſh and ſinne, which
leads us on to all impieties. And in this
reſpect <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>I am not worthy,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Luk.</hi> 3. 16. It was no idle complement in
that good man, That he was not worthy
to untie Chriſts ſhoo-tyers, or to carry his
books after him, as we uſe to ſpeak; but it
is certain, in regard of ſinne which makes
us unfit to do any dutie to God; God is
worthy of <hi>better</hi> ſervice then the beſt of us
can performe, and to have better attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
then we can give him.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe, there is a ſenſe wherein
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:38284:68"/>
we <hi>may</hi> and <hi>muſt</hi> walk worthy of God.
And this is alſo twofold:</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>quoad dignitatem non repugnantiae,</hi>
As a niggard or a ſparing ſervant is an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy</hi>
ſervant to a bountiful maſter, or a
drunkard to a ſervant of God: there is a
repugnancie between a maſter and ſuch a
ſervant. He that will not take up his croſſe
and follow me, is unworthy of me, <hi>Mat.</hi>
10. 37. And in this ſenſe we muſt walk
worthy of God, that is, not contrary to
God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This <hi>worthy</hi> includes <hi>digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem
condecentiae;</hi> Walk <hi>worthy</hi> of God,
<hi>i. e.</hi> ſutable unto him. A correſpondencie
there muſt be between Chriſt and thoſe
that are his, between the children of God,
and God; we muſt walk anſwerable to
him; God is holy, gracious, mercifull, &amp;c.
now we muſt walk <hi>worthy,</hi> (viz,) ſutable
to thoſe attributes; and not to deal baſely
wiſh God, who hath dealt bountifully
with us, and hath delivered us from hell,
and helps us to heaven. Let us not then
put unworthy tricks on God, but let us
walk as men renewed. So much for the
ſenſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:38284:69"/>
This ſpeech is directed to the profeſſors
of the goſpel of Chriſt in <hi>Coloſſe;</hi> for firſt,
<hi>Epaphras</hi> had given out that there were
godly ſoules in that city.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as it was reported; ſo this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
came to <hi>Paul;</hi> he heard that there
were a company of men, that went for
Gods ſaints: <hi>We have heard,</hi> ſaith he <hi>&amp;c.
verſ.</hi> 4. I <hi>Paul</hi> heard ſo; and hence it is
that <hi>Paul</hi> directs his ſpeech. As if he ſhould
ſay, (for ſo it is in the ninth verſe) I hear
that there are profeſſors among you; Now
I pray God that you walk <hi>worthy</hi> of God;
You profeſſe Chriſt and his word, I pray
God you may walk worthy of the maſter
you ſerve. Hence obſerve,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That thoſe that profeſſe Chriſt, muſt walk
worthy of chriſt;</hi> worthy of Chriſt whom
you ſay you ſerve, or they ſerve.</p>
               <p>This is further commanded, and that
expreſly in I <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. 12. That you would
walk worthy of God. Think not that this
is a duty left to your choiſe no, no, ſaith
the Apoſtle, you know how we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
&amp; charged you; as if he ſhould ſay, I
have given many exhortations to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
I have begged that you would do
ſo, <hi>ver.</hi> II. I have encouraged and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:38284:69"/>
them that have done ſo; I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
the unwilling, and you know it,
and I tell you that this is a duty of great
conſequence.</p>
               <p>Firſt <hi>becauſe he hath called you to be cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians;</hi>
now it is a ſhame for you to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
of your calling whereunto you
are called. It is fit, if a man be called unto
a calling, that he be worthy of it. When a
wicked and an unjuſt man is preferred to
be a Judge, God knowes he is a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
man for that calling: A licentious
Divine for a pulpit, is unworthy of that
vocation. It is a ſhame a man ſhould be
unworthy the calling whereunto he is
called. We are called to be Chriſtians; is
it not a ſhame a man ſhould be unworthy
the vocation the Lord hath called him
unto? I beſeech you, ſaith the Apoſtle,
<hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 1. You are called to be Chriſtians
by Chriſt: I beſeech you conſider this,
and be worthy of this calling. Art thou a
Chriſtian, and art thou not loving and
kinde? Are you Chriſtians, and yet are
you careleſſe and ſecure, and will you not
walk as Chriſt walked? What, ſhall a
man be a Chriſtian, and carry himſelf diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſtly,
otherwiſe then the Goſpel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands?
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:38284:70"/>
What a ſhame is this?</p>
               <p>A ſecond ground or reaſon is; <hi>The
Goſpel of God whereby we are called, this is
a bleſſed cailing.</hi> The Lord Jeſus tels thee
what goſpel is, <hi>Luke</hi> 4. 18. itis riches to
the poor, ſight to the blind, deliverance
to captives, a goſpel of peace and libertie
&amp;c. It hath many excellent names in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
Now this is the goſpel whereby you
are called from being damned wretches, to
be the ſons of God. That man is unworthy
of freedome, that is content to be a ſlave;
he is unworthy of theſe bleſſed things
which the goſpel brings, that will walk in
ſinne ſtill. What, will you be captives to
<hi>hell</hi> ſtill? will you go on in your <hi>old</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion
ſtill? will you live after the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of your <hi>own</hi> hearts ſtill, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
you are called by the goſpel?
Have you the goſpel of a Kingdome, and
will you not obey it, when it cals you to be
Kings? what an unworthy thing is this, that
a man ſhould not behave himſelf <hi>worthy</hi> of
the goſpel whereby he is called? <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.
27. This is a main one, that your conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
be <hi>worthy</hi> of the <hi>goſpel</hi> of God.
For men to be covetous proud, drunkards
&amp;c. ſtill, when we have the goſpel to
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:38284:70"/>
draw us out of theſe ſinnes; ſurely it is a
ſhame, and we are unworthy of this goſpel.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe <hi>we are called to
Repentance.</hi> For as we are called by the
goſpel, ſo by the goſpel we are called to
<hi>repentance;</hi> therefore we muſt walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.
Is it repentance enough, to <hi>heare</hi> a
Sermon, or do any good duty? No, no,
theſe are not fruits <hi>worthy</hi> the name of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 3. 8. I mean not worthy
to be repented of, but, not worthy the
name of repentance. For a man to put
finger in the eie, and crie, <hi>Lord;</hi> is this
worthy the name of <hi>repentance?</hi> No, no,
it is othergates mourning then this. True
it is, many repent, but they repent not
<hi>enough;</hi> they muſt bring forth fruits <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
repentance.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, becauſe <hi>if we walk not worthy
of God, the wiſdome of God will not hold us
for his ſervants.</hi> A maſter, if he be wiſe,
will not keep a ſervant that will not do
his buſineſſe; if the maſter have cattell to
be looked unto, and other buſineſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
to be done, if his ſervant do lie and
ſleep all day, or lie at the alehouſe and
neglect his maſters buſineſſe, ſure I am,
if he be but worldly-wiſe, he will not keep
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:38284:71"/>
ſuch a ſervant. In 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30, 31. an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekite
did turn away his ſervant becauſe
he was ſick; this was hard dealing; Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe,
that man that will not walk
<hi>worthy,</hi> that will not look to the <hi>charge</hi>
that God hath given him, he is unworthy
to be Gods ſervant. The Lord hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of buſineſſe to be done; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
to be perform'd, Sacraments to
be received, &amp; abundance of imployment;
&amp; ſhal he hire ſervants &amp; do his work him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?
will any keep a dog, &amp; bark himſelf?
That man is not worthy of God, that will
not do his buſines: therfore the wiſdom of
God will turn us out of doors, becauſe we
leave his work, and fall to wrangling
within our ſelves. What diviſion is there
amongſt us? what heart-burning between
neighbours and neighbours? what grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
cold in religion, &amp;c? And God hath
haſte of buſines to be diſpatched; why
are not his Commandements regarded, his
Promiſes deſired, his Judgements feared?
Certainly, the Lord expects that we
ſhould goe about theſe things, and
wee are unworthy, if wee doe them
not.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:38284:71"/>
Fifthly, <hi>if we will not walk worthy of
God, then 'tis for his glory to caſhiere us out
of his ſanctuarie.</hi> It is not for a maſters
credit to keep a ſervant that will diſcredit
him; as to keep a whoremaſter, or a ſhark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
companion; what will honeſt men
think? Is not he naught himſelf, that keeps
ſuch ſhag-rags about him? All the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour
lies on the maſter. So it is not for
the honour of God, to ſuffer ſuch to be
within the company of profeſſors of his
Name, that diſhonour his Name, and cauſe
the goſpel of God to be blaſphemed by
them that are without. So ſoon as <hi>Eliſhai</hi>
his ſervant had abuſed him, he ſent him
packing, <hi>He went forth from his preſence,</hi>
&amp;c. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5. 27. He ſhould ſtay no
longer with him; why? becauſe he had
diſhonoured him; and what might <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
think? Will he now have ſomething?
and even now he would have nothing;
he hath ſoon repented him of his kindnes.
Though <hi>Naaman</hi> did not argue thus, yet
thus he might, and, for ought we know,
ſuch thoughts he had; but howſoever,
<hi>Geh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>zi</hi> greatly diſhonoured his maſter,
and therefore his maſter ſent him out of
his preſence. Even ſo, if we walk not
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:38284:72"/>
worthy of God, he will turn us put of
doors.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>
                  </label> You that be the ſervants of God, and be
taken with a Lie, undermining one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
or that live uncharitably one with
another; this is a diſhonour to God, this
is not to walk worthy of God: no, It is
to diſgrace the Goſpel, and to caſt aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
on it. Therefore as it concerns the
glory of God, ſo we ought to walk worthy
of God. What may the world think, if
Profeſſors walk looſely, and be taken trip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping?
what will the world ſay? <hi>God keep
me from being a</hi> Puritan; <hi>I had rather be a</hi>
Papiſt: and thus the name of Chriſt comes
to be blaſphemed for your ſakes. Theſe
ſay, Come, come, I warrant you for all
this, yet he will <hi>lie</hi> for a need, though he
ſay <hi>Yes verily.</hi> And thus Religion and the
goſpel of Chriſt is called into queſtion by
the men of this world, even for your ſakes
that walk not worthy of God; nay, by
reaſon of this, God cannot hire ſervants
to do his work. Beloved, God hath ſent
us out to hire ſervants; now many would
come in willingly, but becauſe they ſee &amp;
think that thoſe that profeſſe the name of
Chriſt be diſſemblers, Puritans, and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:38284:72"/>
and therefore they ſay as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the <hi>Indians</hi> did of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
If theſe men be the ſervants of Chriſt, I
will never be his ſervant; So, if theſe men
be the ſervants of God, Lord bleſſe me
from them. What a damned thing is
this?</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>If we walk not worthy of God,
we put great indignity upon him.</hi> A worthy
man cannot abide to meddle with unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
things; and ſhall a Chriſtian ſerve God
after an unworthy faſhion? <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>
                  </label> No maſter,
either in heaven, earth or hell, will have a
ſervant unworthy of him; and this is the
reaſon why men ſweare, and lie, and live
like devils incarnate, becauſe the Devil
will have them worthy of hell. So the
world lets men cozen and diſſemble, for
no other cauſe but becauſe the world will
have them worthy of the world. So that
all maſters, whether the world, the fleſh,
or the devil, look that their ſervants
ſhould be worthy of them; and do you
then think that the Lord will not have his
ſervants walk worthy of him? <hi>Be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
God is not mocked,</hi> Gal. 6. 7. Doſt
thou come into his houſe, heare his Word,
and wilt thou not obey it? Comeſt thou
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:38284:73"/>
to a Sacrament, and haſt thou drinking,
carding and dicing, at home? Thou goeſt
under the name of a good Chriſtian, yet
thou liveſt in thy ſins, having a <hi>ſecret</hi>
luſt,
either to ſweare, or lie, or to commit
adulterie. Take heed, I ſay, God will not
be mocked. For men to go in the name
of Gods children, and yet not to ſerve &amp;
obey him, this is to make a mockery of
God; but God will not be mocked.</p>
               <p>Oh, ſaith one, my Father will never
like it, if I be ſo ſtrict and preciſe; and as
for my Mother, ſhe cannot abide a Puritan.
Another ſaith, I cannot keep my children
unleſſe I put my money to uſe, &amp;c. But
what ſaith Chriſt? <hi>He that loveth father or
mother,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>more then me, is not worthy of
me,</hi> Mat. 10. 37. Doſt thou argue on this
faſhion, and yet hopeſt to be a Chriſtian?
Doſt thou plead <hi>ſelf-reſpect,</hi> and doſt thou
hope to go for a Chriſtian? what a mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erie
is this? nature abhorrs it.</p>
               <p>I remember a ſtorie of a Boy, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at <hi>Lyons,</hi> and ſaw two men, one tall,
and he had a ſhort cloak, the other ſhort,
and he had a long cloak; and thought it
very unſeemly; ſo he took the long cloak
and put it on the tall mans back, and the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:38284:73"/>
cloak on the ſhort mans back, and then it
liked him. So, is it ſeemly that any of us
ſhould weare the long robes of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie,
and yet be ſhort in Obedience?
that we ſhould go for the people of God,
and not behave our ſelves ſutably?</p>
               <p>In this place there is no room for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
to eſtabliſh merit for themſelves;
the Apoſtle intends no ſuch matter in this
place; for we are not our own men, and
therefore cannot merit. We are taught
to pray, <hi>Give us this day our daily bread;</hi>
we have not one bit of bread but we muſt
<hi>beg</hi> it; and when we have done all we
can, (as who doth?) yet we are but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable
ſervants. But ſuppoſe we could
merit all righteouſneſſe; yet all our ability
is from God. Again, ſuppoſe we be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous,
what is that to him? if we be holy,
what is that to him? If we be damned, he
is never the worſe, if we be ſaved, he is
not the better; if we keep all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
yet it is his mercy to ſave us.
He ſhews mercy to thouſands; to whom?
not to them that ſin, but to them that love
me and keep my commandements, <hi>Exod.</hi>
20. 6. To one that keeps Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,
it is his love to ſave him, it is his
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:38284:74"/>
love that he hath mercy on him. The
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do talk much of their
well-doing; but in the mean while what
becomes of their ſins? they ſhould go and
ſuffer for their ſins, and then come and talk
of merit; Do they talk of merit before they
have ſatisfied for their ſinnes? the Law
will be ſatisfied firſt; and when they have
endured hell-fire world without end, then
let them talk of merit. The Lord doth
not mean that we muſt walk worthy ſo as
to <hi>merit</hi> any thing: for ſuppoſe that al1
the ſufferings of this life, and all the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the world that all the Saints of
God have ſuffered, were put on one man,
and he to endure them all; yet they are
not worthy the glory that ſhalbe revealed
<hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 18 Here then is no room for Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
merits. Yet we muſt walk worthy of
God with ſutableneſſe; and if we do not
ſo, the Lord will not owne us. You know
the ſtory of the gueſts in the Goſpel, and
how they were invited to the ſupper; one
pretended one thing, another another
thing; one had married a wife, he could
not come, yet ſure I am he might have
brought her with him: another had bought
oxen, &amp;c. But what followes in the text,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:38284:74"/>
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. Thoſe that were bidden were not
worthy, therefore they ſhall not taſte of
my ſupper. So ſome ſay for their ſinnes,
it is their nature, or one occaſion or other
puts them off, they could not come. None
that are <hi>unworthy</hi> of God, ſhall taſte of the
mercy of God, neither in the pardon of
their ſins, nor ſalvation; no, you get not
ſo much as a taſte of Chriſt, if you walk
not worthy of the goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The truth of this will appeare in the
Uſe, if we conſider what this <hi>worthy
walking</hi> is.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                  </label> Firſt, <hi>We muſt be as it were even the
very nature of God;</hi> we ſhould, as <hi>Peter</hi>
ſpeaks, ſhew forth the vertue of him that
hath called us, that we may ſhew what a
glorious God, what a bleſſed Redeemer,
and righteous Judge we have, and admire
his goodneſſe that hath called us out of
darkneſſe into this glorious light; and
we muſt be holy as he is holy, 1 Pet. 1. 15.
How doth this ſute with the nature of
God, when we walk not worthy of God?
God is <hi>juſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 3. how unworthy
then are we that are <hi>cruel, unmerciful,</hi> and
<hi>unjuſt?</hi> God is a God of <hi>peace,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.
22. how unworthy then are we of him,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:38284:75"/>
that live in <hi>heart-burning</hi> one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other?
We are the image of God, if we
pleaſe him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 7. What a ſhame,
diſhonour, and wrong then is it to God,
that we ſhould have his image, and yet be
nothing like him? Should a glorious King
ſee a deformed picture of himſelf, ſurely
he would make that man ſmoke that pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured
him ſo: And ſhall we go for the
image of God, the God of all glory, and
ſhall we be vile and unclean, negligent and
careleſſe, and yet go for Gods picture?
what do we make of God? will not God
be angry, and will not his wrath burn like
fire? What, am I a drunkard, a whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter,
&amp;c. is this my picture? Sure I am
God cannot endure this.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>conſider the relation we have
with God;</hi> we are the <hi>children</hi> of God, we
are the begotten of the Father: doth God
beget monſters? doth God beget ſuch
children? We profeſſe our ſelves <hi>ſervants</hi>
to God; the ground of that relation is,
that we are at Gods <hi>command:</hi> did God
command us to do the duties of Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
thus? No, no, beloved; if we be <hi>ſervants,</hi>
we muſt be at <hi>his</hi> command. We profeſſe
our ſelves <hi>ſheep of his paſture;</hi> but do we
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:38284:75"/>
live as if we fed on his Commandements?
Is this to live worthy the commons that
Chriſt hath put us in, which is ſuch rich
food of ſalvation? How unworthy is this?
<hi>If I be a father, where is mine honour? If I
be a maſter, where is my feare?</hi> Mal. 1. 6.
Is not this rather to diſhonour God, that
a childe ſhould have a worthy man to his
father, and be a lout himſelf? what indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
is this that we put on God? Let us
examine our ſelves whether we walk <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
of God, or no. I ſpeak to the <hi>profeſſors</hi>
of the goſpel; for it is certain, that they
that profeſſe it not, are unworthy; you
that are yet in the gall of bitterneſſe,
and in the bond of iniquitie, are not
worthy.</p>
               <p>For firſt, <hi>Chriſtianitie is a trade.</hi> What
profeſſion ſoever thou art of, that is thy
trade: will a man ſay to a Phyſitian, what,
cannot you keep your Phyſick to your
ſelf? muſt you needs make profeſſion of
it? Or will a man go to a ſhoo-maker and
ſay, Cannot you keep your ſhooes and
trade to your ſelf? So Chriſtianitie is a
Profeſſion, and thou art unworthy of it
unleſſe thou profeſſe it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:38284:76"/>
Secondly, To what end is a trade? it
will do a man no good unleſſe he profeſſe
it; Every man in his calling lives on his
calling; then, if he live by it, he muſt
walk <hi>worthy</hi> of it. A Lawyer may die for
all his calling, if he profeſſe it not: Doſt
thou walk in no calling nor profeſſion?
Undoubtedly, thou wilt get no living
by it?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Chriſtianitie is an Order.</hi> If a
man be a Papiſt, yet he cannot be a <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſcan,</hi>
unleſſe he profeſſe himſelf to be of
that Order. So if we be Chriſtians, Chriſt
is the father of that order. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt
the High-prieſt of our profeſſion,</hi> Heb. 3. 1.
he is the Father of all Chriſtianitie, and
thou canſt not be a Chriſtian, unleſſe thou
profeſſe that Order. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine
&amp;c.</hi> ſaith our Saviour, or elſe you walk
not worthy of God. I ſpeak this to thoſe
that <hi>profeſſe</hi> Chriſt; for a man may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
a trade, and yet not walk worthy
of it.</p>
               <p>For firſt, <hi>If we walk worthy of God, then
our labours anſwer all the coſt God hath been
at.</hi> That ground is unworthy tillage, that
will not pay the coſt that is beſtowed on
it; that Scholler is not worthy to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:38284:76"/>
that doth not anſwer the coſt of
his Parents. So, my beloved, if you walk
<hi>worthy</hi> of God, anſwer the charges that
God hath been at with you. It hath coſt
God his <hi>Son</hi> to redeem you, and what are
you the better? The work of his Spirit
comes to enlighten us; the labour of his
Miniſters to teach us: Now what are we
the better for all this? It hath coſt God
abundance of <hi>Mercie</hi> to allure us, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of <hi>Judgement</hi> to terrifie us, many
<hi>Corrections,</hi> and above all he is <hi>patient</hi> to
beare with us; and this is a mercie of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.
A man will ſhew <hi>all</hi> he hath, before
he ſhew his <hi>patience;</hi> a man may ſhew
himſelf <hi>kind,</hi> and if he be much wronged,
he will ſay, <hi>What, will you try my patience?</hi>
I tell thee, God hath ſuffered his <hi>patience</hi>
to be tyred by us a long time, and he hath
been at a great deal of coſt with us; but
have we anſwered it? if we have not, we
are <hi>unworthy</hi> of God. God hath been at a
great deal of coſt to make you love one
another, and ſhall there be heart-burning
ſtill? Good ground brings forth good
herbs meet for uſe, not only herbs, but <hi>meet</hi>
herbs: ſo if you be good children to
God, you will bring forth fruit <hi>meet</hi> for
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:38284:77"/>
God; otherwiſe, if God have been at all
this coſt, and you ſecure, and ſtrangers
ſtill one from another, and never the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
you are neer unto curſing, your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
is not to profit in the Word, and ſo
you anſwer not God the coſt that he hath
been at with you. I fear me, God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
his candleſtick, or if he continue it,
you shall have hardneſſe of heart with it:
For ſince thoſe rents have been, how hath
the number of believers decreaſed? when
was one converted? when was a whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter
or a drunkard renewed, unleſſe it be
to take a higher degree in ſin? No, no, the
Goſpel hath done child-bearing; and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this is the cauſe; We walk not <hi>worthy</hi>
of it.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>If we walk worthy of God,
then we walk with God in white.</hi> I have a
few names, &amp;c. <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 4. for they are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
&amp;c. <hi>In white,</hi> (i. e.) in true love and
holineſſe, with white robes of puritie,
clothed with the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt:
but if you be of the black qualities of the
<hi>world,</hi> you walk not <hi>worthy,</hi> you edifie not
your ſelves, nor others; this kind of
walking is for the men of the world, 'tis
for them to ſtand at a ſtay in religion; 'tis
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:38284:77"/>
for them to hear and not to practiſe; theſe
are black qualities; but if you walk <hi>aright,</hi>
you walk with me in <hi>white,</hi> ſaith God;
thoſe that walk aloof, walk unworthy,
like baſe Rogues who are not admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Kings preſence.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>if we walk worthy of God, we
do not diſappoint Gods account.</hi> God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
us ſincere and undefiled, as a Virgin
unſpotted pure in heart; Such as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,
the Lord calls all that are his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
by this name. Now if you walk ſo,
as the world may tax you for pride, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe,
hatred, or <hi>any</hi> other vice; this
is not to walk <hi>worthy</hi> of God, but to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage
Gods account; God counts you
righteous, and the world cenſures you,
and ſayes you are not, and that becauſe of
your ill carriage, and ſo Gods judgement
ſeems not to be right. <hi>they that ſhall be
counted worthy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 20. 35. they that
enjoy Gods glory, are counted <hi>worthy;</hi>
God counts them worthy, Chriſt counts
them worthy, conſcience and the world
counts them worthy: but do you think
that the wicked ſhall ſay at the laſt day
that they were <hi>worthy?</hi> No, no, this were
a diſparagement to God.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:38284:78"/>
Fourthly, <hi>If we walk worthy of God,
then we are importunate beggers;</hi> that beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
that will not beg hard, is unworthy of
an alms; ſo we are unworthy of mercie,
if we beg not hard for it: <hi>Watch therefore
and pray alway, that you may be counted
worthy,</hi> &amp;c. Luk. 21. 36.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>If we walk worthy of God, then
we adde humiliation to every dutie we doe to
God.</hi> It is true, all our prayers are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
unleſſe they be worthy; our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the Sacrament is curſed in Gods
ſight, unleſſe it be done worthily; but
yet not as if there were any <hi>inherent</hi> righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes
in man; no, no. <hi>Luk 6. 6. I am
not worthy,</hi> that is, I think not my ſelf wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.
Here is the worthines of all our wages,
if we pray in faith, and adde humiliation
to our prayers; we muſt obey God, and
adde <hi>humiliation</hi> thereunto, we muſt adde
unto every good duty humiliation; ſo
that if we be <hi>worthy,</hi> we are the <hi>more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</hi>
This is a dutie, as of great moment;
it is ſuch a dutie, as if we walk not worthy
of God in humiliation, we are not capable
of the goſpel, nor pardon of ſinne, if we
be not content to be ruled by Chriſt. If
the houſe be worthy, let your peace abide
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:38284:78"/>
upon it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 11. The peace of Gods
Miniſters is peace to the conſcience; and
the conſcience is at peace, if ſinne be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned:
So that if <hi>this place,</hi> this congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
be not worthy that they ſhould
have pardon of ſin preached, they are not
<hi>capable</hi> of it. The world muſt be pulled
down, ſelf-will and ſelf-luſt muſt be lamed
and mortified, to do as the Lord will have
it; that man is not capable of the goſpel,
that will not be ruled by it.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, let us conſider,
<hi>If we walk not worthy of God, we walk worthy
of ſomewhat elſe;</hi> if not of God, then of
hell, vengeance, and condemnation: Let
us aſſure our ſelves, of whatſoever we walk
worthy, that we ſhall have. I ſpeak not
of worth of <hi>proportion.</hi> Let a man be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
if he be thought worthy of hell,
then to hell he ſhall go; none ſhall go to
hell, but thoſe that are unworthy of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
and none ſhall go to heaven, but
thoſe that have the tokens of heaven about
them. Fill her with blood (ſaith God)
<hi>Rev.</hi> 15. 6. as ſhe was worthy of <hi>blood,</hi> ſo
God would give her blood her belly-full;
ſo when men walk on in their ſinfull cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
as they are worthy, ſo ſhall they have</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="134" facs="tcp:38284:79"/>
Secondly, <hi>You are guilty of Chriſt, if
you walk not worthy of Chriſt.</hi> It is a damnable
thing for a man to be thought or found
guilty of perjurie; but to be thought or
found guilty of Chriſt, this is the greateſt
of all. Beloved, you are guilty of Chriſt,
if you walk not worthy of Chriſt: ſee it in
one branch of a Chriſtians walk. If a man
receive the <hi>Sacrament</hi> unworthily, he is
<hi>guilty</hi> of Chriſt, 1 Cor. 11. 27. If a man
walk unworthily in any one dutie, he is
guilty of Chriſt, and the death of Chriſt
ſhall be laid upon him: Oh, what then
will become of them who walk unworthily
in all the duties of Chriſtianitie? <hi>Judas</hi>
betrayed Chriſt, and thou art guilty;
<hi>Pilate</hi> condemned him, and thou art guilty;
ſo <hi>&amp;c.</hi> His blood lies on thy ſoul, and thou
ſhalt anſwer for it, if thou get not into
Chriſt. Thus you ſee, if we walk not
worthy in one dutie, we are guilty
if all.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>If you walk not worthy of
Chriſt, you ſhall be condemned;</hi> the ſentence
of condemnation is on you for ever. <hi>He
that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth
and drinketh his own damnation;</hi> and this
is but one branch. So he that <hi>prayes,</hi> or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth</hi>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:38284:79"/>
the name of Chriſt unworthily, what
ever duty it be, if a man labour not to do it
ſutable to God, it is his <hi>damnation.</hi> That
priſoner is unworthy of a pardon, that will
not ſtand to the conditions of his pardon,
and be ruled by the Judge. Even ſo, you
that will not walk holily according to the
<hi>conditions</hi> of the goſpel, you are not
worthy of pardon, and you ſhall never
enjoy it; for the Lord knows beforehand
who are <hi>worthy</hi> walkers before him. Hath
God children here, and vvould they be
ſo accounted? Let them vvalk <hi>worthy</hi> of
God, let their light ſhine, &amp;c. let them la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to quit the coſt that God hath been
at; vvalk vvith Chriſt in <hi>all</hi> thy vvaies,
for this is to vvalk vvorthy of God in all
pleaſing. <hi>Let this ſuffice for Exhortation.</hi>

Would he have us ſtrive to pleaſe all men?
this were but flatterie: No, no, there is

reference to the walking worthy of the

to the Lord. And this is not <hi>impoſſible;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe <hi>God is not a rigorous God,</hi>

is, if God ſhould require obedience in ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> as God is not a rigorous God,
ſo there is a way to walk wherein we may
pleaſe him, and that is the way of ſincere
walking. <hi>It was Gods advice to</hi> Abraham
Gen. 17. I. <hi>We muſt be faithfull in our
calling: ſee it in</hi> David; I will magnifie
God with thanksgiving, and this alſo ſhall
pleaſe the Lord, &amp;c. <hi>Pſal. 69. 31. To be
thankfull and to obey his commandement
is the way to pleaſe God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>the Lord hath ſhewed us this
way;</hi> he might have been at choice whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he would have told us what would
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:38284:83"/>
be pleaſing in his ſight or no; he might
have left that for us to have ſtudied out,
or elſe he might have ſent us to hell for our
ignorance in it; he might have choſen
whether he would have come and taught
us our horne-book or no. Like as a Maſter
once in a comedy, when his ſervant could
not pleaſe him, ſaith the ſervent, pray
Maſter tell me what I ſhall doe to pleaſe
you; nay ſaith the Maſter, Sirrah, look
you to that; ſo God might have made us
look to that our ſelves, and that moſt juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
too; but here appeares the <hi>love</hi> of God;
as there is a <hi>way</hi> ſo he hath <hi>ſhewed</hi> us this
way, ſaying <hi>this is my beloved ſonne, heare
him. Mat.</hi> 12. 3. As if he ſhouid ſay, goe
to my ſonne, he will tell you what you
ſhall doe to pleaſe me, for in him I am
well pleaſed; he doth not ſay <hi>with him,</hi>
though that had been true, yet but halfe
the meaning; but <hi>in him;</hi> get to him, be
governed by him, be ingrafted into him,
this is the courſe you are to take to pleaſe
me; this is my beloved.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, as God hath ſhewed us this
way, ſo there be ſome that have walked in
this way before us. The children of God,
in all ages have laboured to <hi>pleaſe</hi> God,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:38284:83"/>
and that as a child laboureth to pleaſe
his Father <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 5.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee it is <hi>poſſible</hi> to pleaſe
God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>as it is poſſible, ſo likewiſe it
is a fit duty,</hi> it is very fit we ſhould all
labour to pleaſe God.</p>
               <p>For firſt, <hi>God is a great king;</hi> now
great ones you know looke to be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedi
a man cannot ſpeake to a great man
without he ſay <hi>and if it ſhall pleaſe you.
Eſther.</hi> 1. 19. If it pleaſe the King, &amp;c.
ſuch as have <hi>greatneſſe,</hi> looke for this ſtile;
and it is fit it ſhould be ſo, that greatneſſe
ſhould have the companions of it, which
is to be <hi>pleaſed.</hi> Now who is ſo great as
God? and therefore 'tis fit his ſervants
ſhould <hi>pleaſe</hi> him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as God is a great God, ſo his
pleaſure is a good pleaſure, <hi>ergo</hi> it is fit
hee ſhould bee pleaſed; hence it is called
the good pleaſure of his will, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 5.
Look what ever Gods pleaſure is, 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
good, <hi>ergo</hi> it is fit hee ſhould be
pleaſed, becauſe it is alwayes agreeable
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o reaſon; 'tis not alwayes fit we ſhould
pleaſe men, for they are wicked many
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>imes in their deſires. See it in <hi>Ahaſhue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus;</hi>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:38284:84"/>
his pleaſure was one while utterly to
extirpate the Jews; It was <hi>Darius</hi> pleaſure
to ſeal an idolatrous Decree; it was <hi>Pharohs</hi>
pleaſure to ſet hard tasks on Gods people,
and <hi>Herods</hi> pleaſure was to put <hi>James</hi> to
death, and it pleaſed the Jewes too; thus
you ſee all their pleaſures were wicked;
nay, all men, their pleaſures are not always
good, and therefore not fit at <hi>all</hi> times
to pleaſe them; but God is alwayes good,
and therefore it ſtands with equity that he
ſhould alwayes be pleaſed.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>if we will not, our betters wil,</hi>
and therefore it is fit we ſhould; Chriſt
was and is our <hi>better,</hi> and he did thoſe
things which pleaſed God, <hi>John</hi> 8. 29.
The Angels of heaven think it fit, they
bleſſe the Lord, and they alſo are our <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi>
ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. 21. If theſe think it
fit to pleaſe God, it if much more fit that
we ſhould ſerve and pleaſe him. We argue
thus, Will you not do as I bid you? your
betters will: ſo then you ſee they are our
betters that will pleaſe God.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>it is moſt ſutable with our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
that we ſhould do ſo;</hi> for if wee
ſhould not <hi>pleaſe</hi> God, our conſciences
would find fault with it. If our conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:38284:84"/>
condemne us not, <hi>&amp;c. John</hi> 3. 21.
then we doe thoſe things that are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
in his ſight; the pleaſing of God is
ſet down as a pleaſing thing to our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences;
and can we deſire a more fit duty
then that which our own ſelves will charge
us with rebellion if we be not conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
unto it? ſuch is the pleaſing of God;
it is <hi>naturally</hi> in the conſcience of all men
that God is to be pleaſed; how often read
we in heathen books, <hi>if it pleaſe God?</hi> and
it is a common phraſe in moſt mens
mouths, and therefore a fit duty.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>it is a duty moſt ſutable with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
ſociety;</hi> if all men would labour to
pleaſe God there would be no hatred, no
tale-bearing, no falling out: Oh what a
bleſſed life might we lead if we would la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to pleaſe God? this is the true ground
of all good fellowſhip: But what was the
reaſon the Jewes were contrary to all men?
It was this, becauſe they did not pleaſe
God, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. 15. when every one plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
himſelf in his luſts and deſires, then
there muſt needs be a contrariety among
men; for one mans will is <hi>contrary</hi> to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nothers;
one will have this, another that;
but if all would referre their will to Gods
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:38284:85"/>
will, and agree in one, there would be no
contrariety among men.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>as it is a poſſible and a fit duty,
ſo it is a large duty;</hi> it runs along as Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitors
obſerve, in all our thoughts, words
and deeds. It muſt be at <hi>all</hi> times and in
all places, and in all regards. It is I ſay a
large duty, and I will ſhew it in ſixe
things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>it is the end of all our duties;</hi> what
duty is there for a Chriſtian to undertake,
but he is to pleaſe God in it? why do we
hear, pray, receive the Sacrament, beleeve,
repent, ſuffer injuries for Chriſts ſake, but
that we may pleaſe God? why muſt chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
obey their parents, but that they may
therein pleaſe God? I can go about no
duty; but if I mean to do it aright, I muſt
propound this end, that I may pleaſe
God.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>it is large in that it is the moſt
acceptable of all duties;</hi> and indeed it is
the forme and life of all performances;
prayer is abomination to God, unleſſe we
pleaſe God in that action; the pleaſing of
God is that which puts life in that duty
which we undertake, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4. 19. the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
combines theſe two, <hi>acceptable</hi> and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:38284:85"/>
                  <hi>well pleaſing;</hi> and they cannot well bee
ſeparate; if any Sacrifice be wel-pleaſng,
it muſt needs be acceptable unto God;
therefore it is pleaſing, becauſe it makes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
duty acceptable.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>it is large, in that it is uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finable
to place or time,</hi> we muſt not only
be godly at Church, but at home alſo; not
only faire carriaged in the company of the
godly, but we muſt be holy in all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
pleaſe God in all places; we muſt
labour to pleaſe him <hi>whereſoever</hi> we are; it
is a duty not conſcribed to any place; ſhall
a man pleaſe God at a Sermon and diſpleaſe
him abroad by drunkenneſſe and whoring,
&amp;c? ſhall we think to pleaſe God in ſuch
a place where we cannot for ſhame break
out into unſavory ſpeeches, and at another
time, and in another place endure any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe?
this is not to pleaſe God, but
rather the contrary. No, no; it is not
limited to <hi>time,</hi> not <hi>place;</hi> we muſt <hi>pleaſe</hi>
God not onely in prayer time, but alſo
when prayer is ended; not in Sermon
time only, but when the Sermon is ended
alſo. Labour therefore to pleaſe God at
<hi>all</hi> times; not on Sundayes only, but on
the week dayes alſo; many will read on
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:38284:86"/>
the Sabbath, but never elſe; but this is a
duty to be performed at <hi>all</hi> times; 'tis not
as hearing, that cannot be performed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes:
no, it is a generall duty, <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotles</hi>
Univerſals: and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. 5. I will
walk before the Lord, &amp;c. <hi>Placebo Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi>
will pleaſe the Lord in the land of
the living. This contains the ſumme of
all Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>
                  </label>
                  <hi>The largeneſſe of it appears in this, that it
is in all things:</hi> 'tis larger then the ſervants
duty to pleaſe their maſters; yet ſervants
muſt labour to pleaſe their maſters in all
things, 2 <hi>Tit.</hi> 9. 9. But if ſervants muſt
pleaſe their maſters in all things, then how
can the duty of pleaſing God be larger?<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label>
True it is, ſervants muſt pleaſe their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
in all things, (<hi>i.e.</hi>) in all that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of God; otherwiſe they may not;
for when the thing is forbidden by God,
'tis nothing but the privation of the thing.
Sinnes are <hi>privations:</hi> an Idol is nothing;
all ſinnes are as idols, they are nothing;
'tis not an <hi>action,</hi> bur the <hi>privation</hi> of the
image of God that ſhould be there, and of
agreeableneſſe to the Word in all things
that are not contrary to the Word: the
duty of pleaſing man muſt be bounded
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:38284:86"/>
within another, but we muſt pleaſe God
without limitation.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>it is large, in that it is an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
duty;</hi> it ſhall be a duty, when other
duties ceaſe. Prayer, belief, repentance,
weeping and mourning, &amp;c. muſt ceaſe,
when Gods children come to heaven;
they muſt pray no more, faſt no more; no,
theſe duties muſt ceaſe; but this is &amp; muſt
be a duty when they are dead and gone,
it is an everlaſting duty, it is that which we
muſt carry to our graves, yea into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
world with us. It is the fruit of all
other duties; we are tryed by prayer and
hearing, &amp;c. as by apprentiſhip, that ſo
we may learn this art <hi>of well-pleaſing</hi> God;
if we have not learned this art, we are not
capable of entring into life, ſo that in ſome
ſenſe it is above the commandements:
we will keep the commandements, that
we may pleaſe God; this is the crown of
all our obedience, not as if it could be
more, but the pleaſing of God in theſe is
the upſhot of all our obedience to God.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>It is large, in that it is the whole
duty of the new man;</hi> only new men in
Chriſt can pleaſe God, unregenerate men
cannot pleaſe God; let them give alms,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:38284:87"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet if they be not <hi>new treatures,</hi> they
cannot pleaſe God; let them do actions,
though never ſo good for <hi>manner</hi> or <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
yet they are worthleſſe in the hand of
an unregenerate man. <hi>They that are in the
fleſh cannot pleaſe God,</hi> Rom. 8. 8. He
ſpeakes not of ſuch as are <hi>married;</hi> for
<hi>Zacharie</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were married, and
they pleaſed God: but thoſe that <hi>walk</hi>
after the fleſh as unregenerate, unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
unpurified, ſuch as live in ſin, none of
theſe can ever pleaſe God. Thus you ſee
it is the whole duty of the new man.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>as it is poſſible, fit, and large,
ſo it is a neceſſary duty.</hi> The Apoſtle ſets
a <hi>muſt,</hi> and an <hi>ought</hi> upon it, 1. <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 2.
It muſt be done, there is a <hi>neceſſary</hi> laid
upon it. It muſt be done.</p>
               <p>For firſt, <hi>we have no ſaving grace, unleſſe
we labour to pleaſe God;</hi> it comes from
God good pleaſure, and it goes to Gods
good pleaſure. God is well pleaſed in his
image, and grace is the image of God:
Now then, if a man pleaſe not God, it is
becauſe he hath no grace: Thou thinkeſt
Chriſt did die for thee, thou thinkeſt a lie,
why? thou haſt no ſaving grace. <hi>Let us
have grace,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that we may
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:38284:87"/>
ſerve God,</hi> Heb. 12. as if he ſhould ſay,
without grace it is impoſſible to pleaſe him:
therefore you ſee it is very <hi>neceſſary</hi> to
pleaſe God, 'tis as neceſſary as grace, and
without it we are damned.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>if we do not pleaſe God, we
may ſee what a wofull caſe we are in;</hi> it God
be not pleaſed to ſpare us, we cannot be
ſaved. Now a man will be ſure to pleaſe
that man that can hang him if he pleaſe;
he will not pull his diſpleaſure upon him.
<hi>Acts.</hi> 12. when <hi>Herod</hi> was diſpleaſed, they
laboured to turn away his diſpleaſure, and
made friends; ſo we depend on God, and
therefore our ſouls, bodies, and everlaſting
happineſſe or deſtruction depends on God;
and if he be not pleaſed, what benefit can
we wretches expect? Wouldeſt thou have
mercy, and wilt thou not pleaſe God?
thou ſhalt be deceived. Becauſe <hi>Heſter</hi>
pleaſed the King, he ſhewed her kindneſſe;
and God will never ſhew us kindneſſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
we pleaſe him. There is no man ſo
mad, to heap good turnes upon a
mans head that will not pleaſe him; how
can we have the good pleaſure of God,
when we will not ſeek to pleaſe God?
Before <hi>Enoch</hi> was tranſlated, it was ſaid
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:38284:88"/>
                  <hi>he pleaſed God?</hi> Heb. 11. 5. God would
never have brought him to heaven, if he
had not been pleaſed with him. So before
he <hi>tranſlates</hi> thee from earth to heaven,
before he delivers thee from, damnation,
thou muſt be ſure to pleaſe God.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>if we labour not to pleaſe God,
God knowes what infinite dangers we are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in;</hi> in the morning he may brain us,
or wee may die and periſh in our ſleep,
or in any action; God knowes what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheif
may befall us if we pleaſe not God.
If a man prove a Traitour to the King,
God knowes what the King will do unto
him; the wrath of a King is as the roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of a Lion; Oh then what is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
of the judge both of quick and
dead? If God be diſpleaſed with us, God
knowes what will become of us, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
eat a meales meat ſafely, wee. may
be choakt for ought we know; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſecure one moment; It may be
this is the moment he meanes to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
thee, to lay rottenneſſe on thy
heart; It may be he will lay the curſe of
heaven upon thee before thou goe home
and be no more ſeen; but if thou pleaſe
God <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9. 7. come what can come,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:38284:88"/>
nothing can come amiſſe to them that
pleaſeth the Lord but if thy wayes <hi>pleaſe</hi>
not the Lord, thou liveſt in a damnable
condition.</p>
               <p>Is it ſo that the duty of pleaſing God
is ſo poſſible, fit, large, and neceſſary?
here then three ſorts of men are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned,</p>
               <p>Firſt thoſe that pleaſe not God. Do you
thinke then that this is pleaſing to God
that there ſhould be ſo many Ale-hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
in the Towne, or in any ſuch place as
this where the Goſpel hath been ſo long
taught, that there ſhould be ſo many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
Eſaues which walke after the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſſe
of their owne hearts? Do you
think that it is pleaſing to God that you
ſhould think hardly of them that think
beſt of the Word? Think you, is it beſt
pleaſing to God, that you ſhould have <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate</hi>
courſes in your families, that after
ſo much preaching, yet many of you ſhould
be ſtill in your ſinnes? Is this pleaſing to
God? Oh conſider what you pull upon
your ſelves, viz. <hi>wrath,</hi> yea wrath to the
utmoſt. It is a grievous thing for a man
to pull the wrath of a King upon him;
You ſhall not do this on pain of <hi>Our</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:38284:89"/>
Do then, if you dare. If the
wrath of a <hi>King</hi> then be ſo great, and ſo to
be feared; what then is the wrath (and
that to the utmoſt) of the <hi>ever living God?</hi>
Deſtruction and damnation to the <hi>utmoſt;</hi>
God will ſhew no mercy to them that
make no conſcience to pleaſe him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>this condemns thoſe that pleaſe
men.</hi> If it be ſo neceſſary to pleaſe God,
what will then become of men-pleaſers,
as ſuch there are, and too too many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt,
us, that carry tales, &amp;c? why?
becauſe they will <hi>pleaſe</hi> ſuch and ſuch men:
Such are many of your children and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
in Alehouſes, that can fill pot after
pot, and that becauſe it is their maſters
pleaſure that it ſhould be ſo: But what
will become of this in the end? <hi>If I ſhould
pleaſe men, &amp;c.</hi> Gal. 1. 10. If not the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of God or of Chriſt, then I muſt
needs be the ſervant of the Devil. I, even
<hi>I Paul,</hi> if I ſhould ſeek to pleaſe men, I
were none of the ſervants of Jeſus
Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>this alſo condemns thoſe that
pleaſe themſelves.</hi> Many there are that are
ſelf-pleaſers, which walk after their ſelf-wils,
ſelf-conceits, ſelf-deſires, and ſelf-affections.
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:38284:89"/>
It is pleaſing to them to drink,
to ſwagger, to dice and to card; It is
pleaſing to them to ſhuffle over the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
of God; why? becauſe they have
other things to do. Oh think, I beſeech
you, what a grievous evil you pull on your
heads, that are <hi>ſelf-pleaſers;</hi> You draw
down upon you more then ſwift damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
How can that be, will you ſay? Yes,
a man may pull down more then naked
damnation; <hi>double</hi> damnation is more then
<hi>ſingle;</hi> now if you pleaſe your ſelves, live
as you liſt, do as you liſt, you pull on your
ſelves damnation with a miſchiefe. God
will reſerve all the wicked for the day of
judgement to puniſh them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. but
chiefly them that are <hi>ſelf-pleaſers,</hi> unto
whom he gives ſpecial marks; as firſt, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
perſons;</hi> 2. ſuch as rebel agianſt God;
3. <hi>Preſumptuous,</hi> ſuch as build caſtles in the
aire (as we uſe to ſay) on Gods mercy;
4. He reckons the <hi>ſelf-willed,</hi> in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<hi>ſelf-pleaſers</hi> (i.e.) when a man follows
his own will and pleaſure. Theſe are they
that God will <hi>chiefly</hi> caſt into <hi>damnation:</hi>
this is to pull damnation, and more then
damnation upon thee. <hi>And thus, by Gods
aſſiſtance, you have ſeen the proſecution of this
Point.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is ſpoken from the good
Thief on the Croſſe, <hi>And
be ſaid unto,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi>
caſes never make
a <hi>common</hi> rule: The ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
rule is this, As is a mans life, ſo is his
death. 'Tis a common axiome, and it is as
true as common, <hi>Qualis vita, finis ita;</hi>
a good life cannot chooſe but have a good
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:38284:92"/>
death, and a wicked life a curſed end:
this is the <hi>ordinary</hi> rule.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſſe there are <hi>extraordinary</hi>
caſes wherein it may be otherwiſe, and
theſe caſes are referred to four heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>when it pleaſeth God to ſhew his
prerogative royall,</hi> he may convert a man
at the laſt gaſpe, and give unto the laſt
even as unto the firſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 13. his
grace is his owne, Chriſt his owne, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is his owne, and he may doe with
his owne as he will; this is Gods <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative;</hi>
as a King may pardon an old
beaten Traitor, and thereby ſhew his
prerogative: but this is not <hi>ordinary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>when a ſinner hath not had
meanes of ſalvation in this life, but only
at his death;</hi> as when S. <hi>Paul</hi> came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Corinth,</hi> many were there lying on their
death-beds, S. <hi>Paul</hi> converted ſome of
them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 29. Alas, they were Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
before, they never had the means of
ſalvation before; yet ſo it pleaſeth the
Lord ſometimes to ſtep in and convert a
ſinner that never had the <hi>meanes</hi> before:
but this caſe is not ordinary neither; for
now we have the means and health.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>when it comes to paſſe that a
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:38284:92"/>
ſinner is made an example to all the world,</hi>
as when a theef is brought to the gallows,
&amp; the Lord converts him: And for ought
we know, this was the caſe Of <hi>Achan,</hi>
Joſ. 7. 25. he was converted perhaps, when
the ſtones flew about his eares.</p>
               <p>Another extraordinary caſe is, <hi>when
the Lord may be as much honoured by a mans
death, as he hath been diſhonoured by his life.</hi>
In ſuch a caſe ſome live, and it pleaſeth the
Lord to giue repentance unto life: And
this was the caſe of this Thief; he did as
much <hi>honour</hi> God at his death, (as you
ſhall ſee in his repentance) as many whoſe
<hi>lives</hi> were ſpent in all holineſſe.</p>
               <p>The priviledges of a few men make no
common rule; men deal with repentance
(as a Divine ſpeaks) as they do with their
Wills, they put them off to the laſt gaſp;
ſo they put off repentance to the laſt hour,
like <hi>A chitophel,</hi> that never ſet his houſe in
order till he went and hanged himſelf. As
it is ſaid of the ſerpent, it growes crooked
all the dayes of his life, and when it dies
then it ſtraightens it ſelfe: So many
walke perverſly while they are well, and
then to ſtraighten all, cry God mercy
when they are a dying, as the heart of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:38284:93"/>
oak, that never growes ſoft till it is dead
and rotten; ſo they never ſoften their
hearts with repentance, till they ſee they
muſt die, and then they fall to their beads
and ſay, Was not the Thief converted at
the laſt? and did not the Thief on the
croſſe find forgiveneſſe? and why then
may not I? Thus they bear themſelves on
the example of the Thiefs converſion.
I dare be bold to ſay, that this Thief never
ſtole more goods in his life, then his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
hath ſtollen ſouls from heaven after
his death. Therefore I have choſen this
Text, to let you all know that the repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of this Thief was no <hi>ordinary</hi> thing,
nay, to us an <hi>extraordinary wonder,</hi> and
therefore there is no truſting to it; For,
for a man to be careleſſe while he is well,
hoping to ſpeed with repentance at the
laſt, is vain.</p>
               <p>Now that this his repentance was <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,</hi>
I prove it by <hi>five</hi> arguments.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>becauſe it was one of the wonders of
Chriſts paſsion:</hi> now Chriſts paſſion was
full of wonders, and they were of two
ſorts, <hi>Corporall</hi> and <hi>Spirituall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt wonder was in the <hi>heavens,</hi>
the Sun was ecclipſed, the Moon the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:38284:93"/>
at the full, which is a miracle in nature.
To ſhew that Chriſt the Sun of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
was ecclipſed at that time; for there
was darkneſſe over the face of the whole
earth, <hi>Mark</hi> 15. 33.</p>
               <p>The ſecond wonder was in the <hi>temple,</hi>
the vale of the temple did rent, <hi>verſ.</hi> 38.
to ſhew that the ceremonies therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
were abrogated, the ſubſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
then preſent.</p>
               <p>The third wonder was in the <hi>rocks,</hi> the
hard rocks clave, to convince the hardnes
of thoſe that did not rent their hearts.</p>
               <p>The fourth wonder was in the <hi>earth,
Mat.</hi> 27. 31. the earth did quake at the
ſight thereof, to upbraid thoſe that
quaked not.</p>
               <p>The fifth wonder was in the <hi>ſepulchres,</hi>
many graves were opened, to ſhew the
vertue of Chriſts paſſion.</p>
               <p>And as there were wonders <hi>corporall,</hi> ſo
there were wonders <hi>ſpirituall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, the <hi>Centurion</hi> glorified God, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
This was the Son of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 54.
Secondly, there was a <hi>wonder among the
people, beholding the things that were done;</hi>
they ſmote their breaſts, and returned.
A third <hi>wonder</hi> was on this <hi>thief,</hi> for he
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:38284:94"/>
was converted; <hi>To day ſhalt thou be with me
in paradiſe.</hi> Thus you ſee that Chriſts
paſſion was full of wonders, ſo that there
is no ground for a man to delay his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
hoping to repent as this Thief did,
unleſſe he will look for wonders. Canſt
thou expect, when thou lieſt a <hi>dying,</hi> that
that he will rent the rocks again, or open
the graves, or create new wonders? No,
no, thou canſt not look for forgiveneſſe,
if thou <hi>deferreſt</hi> thy repentance: This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
was <hi>extraordinary,</hi> and one of
the wonders of Chriſts paſſion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>that this repentance was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,
it may appear by the number;</hi>
for of all numbers of men from the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
to that houre, it was never read that
any one was converted thus <hi>at the laſt,</hi> as
was this Thief; ſo that for all that we
know, for this one Thief that was <hi>penitent</hi>
and ſo <hi>ſaved</hi> at the <hi>laſt,</hi> the whole world of
the wicked and ungodly, that <hi>delayed</hi> their
repentance, living and dying in <hi>ſin,</hi> were
damned for ever. For all that we know,
<hi>Er</hi> and <hi>Onan, Jeroboam</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> as
they lived in ſin, ſo the Scriptures plainly
ſhew that they died in their ſinnes. What
need I ſpeak of thoſe hundred fourſcore
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:38284:94"/>
and five thouſand, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 19. 35. all clapt
to hell in one night, for all we know?
What need I ſpeak of the old world? As
they were diſobedient in the dayes of
<hi>Noah,</hi> ſo they are now in chains. What
need I ſpeak of <hi>Admah, Zeboim, Sodom</hi>
and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> burnt with fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone?
ſo that as they lived in ſin, ſo they
died and were damned in their ſins, for all
we know. Now what poor ground is this
for a man to <hi>deferre</hi> his repentance, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to repent at the laſt houre, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
ſo many millions of men, only this
Thief found repentance? Thus you ſee
it was extraordinary, in regard of the
number.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>in regard of the ſuddenneſſe of
it.</hi> Repentance the work of grace or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
takes up the whole time of life,
and will require as many dayes as a man
lives; this is a <hi>great</hi> work and it cannot
be performed on the ſuddain; and yet
that this work ſhould be attained unto
in that while he was on the croſſe, this
muſt needs be <hi>wonderfull;</hi> nay he had
not ſo much time; for it ſeems he did
hang on the croſſe in his ſin, the thieves
(ſaith the text) reviled him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 44.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:38284:95"/>
both caſt the ſame thing in his diſh, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he was not working repentance all
the time; this then muſt needs be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull,
that this work ſhould be diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in one houre, and God knowes it
might have been in leſſe time effected.
Is it not a wonder that a man that hath
no ſkill in muſick ſhould learne that Art
in one houre? Is it not a wonder that a
boy that knowes not a letter in the book
ſhould learne to write and read well and
ſpeak good latine in one houre? Is it not
a wonder that a man that is an <hi>errant ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noramus,</hi>
ſhould attaine to be a good
Lawyer in one houre? Theſe are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:
So I tell you repentance, grace
and converſion, are <hi>hard</hi> artes, harder
then muſick or divinity, harder then all
artes; there is no arte ſo hard as to learne
to goe to heaven, and can a man learne
this in one houre? if he doe, it is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
It coſt <hi>David</hi> all his life time; <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy</hi>
from his youth ſtudied the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and <hi>Hillary</hi> ſaid, 90. <hi>yeares have I
been learning to die.</hi> If a man had Methu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalahs
dayes he could no more then con
this leſſon, now ſeeing repentance is ſo
long an arte, and we think to repent as
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:38284:95"/>
the thiefe, becauſe <hi>Philip</hi> was carried to
<hi>Azotus</hi> at a trice, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 30. which was
as ſome affirme 16 miles, doth it follow
that another ſhall doe ſo too? the way
to heaven is a long way, and if the thief
diſpatcht it in one houre, it was a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This repentance was extraordinary in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the Evangelicall perfection of it,</hi>
though diſpatcht on a ſuddaine, yet it was
not done to halves, but was perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
of theſe ſeven parts.</p>
               <p>For firſt, there was his <hi>penetentiall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi>
as you may read verſe. 41. we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
juſtly receive the due reward of our
death, <hi>q. d.</hi> Tis juſt with God that I am
brought to the gallows, &amp; juſt it were with
God if I were damned; I have lived all my
dayes in roving and hunting up and
downe, in breaking Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and now God hath juſtly found
me out; this is his open penitentiall
confeſſion.</p>
               <p>Here is his <hi>penitentiall profeſſion,</hi> but
this man hath done nothing amiſſe, all
his Doctrine was true, not one jot amiſſe
in all his life, there was nothing amiſſe;
but you Scribes have cryed crucifie him
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:38284:96"/>
amiſſe; thou wretched <hi>Judas</hi> haſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
him amiſſe; he is the Son of
God; here he confeſſeth Chriſt to be
the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and thus he ſtood for him
againſt all the world.</p>
               <p>3. Here is his <hi>penitential ſatisfaction;</hi>
as he had been partner with the other
thiefe in ſin, ſo now he labours to make
him ſatisfaction in turning him to God;
in the 40 verſe, doſt thou not feare
God, ſeeing thou art in the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation?
Alas thou and I have plaid
the villanes againſt God, and are juſtly
damned; But as we have been theeves
together, ſo now let us repent together,
and call on God together; doſt thou
not feare God ſeeing that thou art in
the ſame condemnation? and thus he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
to convert his fellow thief.</p>
               <p>4. Here is his <hi>penitential ſelf-denyal;</hi> he
denyes himſelf, he loves the glory of God
more then his owne ſoule or ſalvation,
mark here how he labours to convert his
fellow thiefe and to make him give all
the glory to God; he was ſo wounded
to the ſoule that his fellow thief ſhould
diſhonour God, as that he laboured to
turn him before he prayed for his own
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:38284:96"/>
ſoule; doſt thou not fear God? &amp;c. this
he ſaid, before he ſaid, <hi>Lord remember
mee;</hi> he lets his owne ſoule lie at the
ſtake while he labours to glorifie God;
ſo that it is plaine he loves God more
then his owne ſoule.</p>
               <p>5. Here you may ſee his <hi>penitential faith,</hi>
he beleeves not with a <hi>generall</hi> faith,
but with a <hi>ſaving</hi> and <hi>particular</hi> faith,
with faith and aſſurance he lookes on
Chriſt as his Jeſus; he ſaid unto Jeſus;
there is not one idle word in this text,
the holy Ghoſt ſayes he ſaid unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,
he ſaid not that he thought to ſay
ſo, but the Spirit of God witneſſeth
that he ſaid ſo indeed, he ſpake to Chriſt
as to a Jeſus.</p>
               <p>6. Here is his <hi>penitential resolution</hi> of
newnes of life &amp; new obedience for time to
come; <hi>Lord, remember mee;</hi> he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth
Chriſt to bee his Lord, <hi>q. d.</hi> I have
followed the imaginations of my owne
will hitherto; all my ſtealing and other
ſins have been to fulfill my owne will;
but now I confeſſe thee to be my Lord,
and were I to live againe, or any longer,
I would for ever ſerve thee.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, here is his <hi>penitential prayer,</hi>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:38284:97"/>
Lord remember me; he acknowledges
Chriſt to be <hi>his</hi> Lord, nay he did not
only pray thus, but ſaith <hi>Baſil,</hi> he offered
much prayer unto God, even as much as
his ſhort time could permit; theſe words
are but the ſumme of what he ſpake, Lord
remember mee, &amp;c. thus you ſee he was no
more a thief but a convert and confeſſour,
as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> obſerves, a wicked thief to
ſteal earthly things, but a good thief (as we
call him to this day) to break through into
the Kingdom of heaven, he ſteals Paradiſe;
thus you ſee what a <hi>wonderfull</hi> repentance
he had in regard of the perfection of it;
<hi>faith</hi> was in it, <hi>humiliation</hi> was in it, <hi>turning
to God</hi> was in it, <hi>felfe-denyall</hi> was in it,
<hi>ſatisfaction</hi> was in it, <hi>and glorifying of God
in the face of the world</hi> was in it; nay he was
the only profeſſor of Chriſt, to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
at that time; he had never a ſervant
but this; never a word at this time ſpoken
for Chriſt, but that which this Thief ſpake;
none to back Chriſt but this Thief; he
was the only profeſſor and confeſſor of
Chriſt at this time, the only man on the
earth that glorified GOD. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
unleſſe thou expect ſuch a death,
to bring ſuch glory to God as this Thief
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:38284:97"/>
did, never beare thy ſelf upon his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>This repentance was extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
in regard of the incomparableneſſe of it;</hi>
Never was there ſuch a repentance ſince
the world began, nor ſhall be while the
world ſtands: for when all the world,
Jews and Gentiles, ſtood in their obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie,
Prieſts and Rulers, great and ſmall,
all cryed <hi>Crucifie him;</hi> and when the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
doubted, this Thief believed; and
when <hi>Peter</hi> denied Chriſt, this Thief re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
and confeſſed Chriſt; nay, when
all the Apoſtles ſhewed their heeles, this
Thief ſtood to his tacklings, this Thief
maintains Chriſt againſt them all; nay
when <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> out of whom Chriſt
had caſt ſeven devils, when ſhe was afraid
to come neer to the Croſſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 55.
and the mother of <hi>Zebedees</hi> children, who
ſhould have come neer, yet they ſtood
a far off; only this Thief published the
goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, and makes open ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of him to be the Saviour
of the world, when all his Diſciples and
the world forſook him in their obſtinacie,
and, as the Papiſts obſerve, God then had
no viſible Church upon the earth; ſo that
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:38284:98"/>
this Thief on the croſſe put down all the
world for repentance, yea the Apoſtles of
Chriſt. Now ſhew me ſuch a repentance
whereby thou maieſt put down <hi>Peter</hi> and
all the Apoſtles of Chriſt; either ſhew me
<hi>ſuch</hi> a repentance, extraordinary, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable,
and wonderfull, to make them
all aſhamed: I ſay, either ſhew me <hi>ſuch</hi> a
repentance, or never truſt on the Thieves
example on the croſſe. If a man have a
hundred miles to go for his life, and but a
ſhort time allotted unto him, he had need
make haſte. Now the way to <hi>heaven</hi> is a
long way, and he that can begin and end
that journy when he lies a <hi>dying,</hi> is the quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt
man of foot that ever yet was heard,
this Thief only excepted. If thou <hi>run</hi> to
<hi>obtain,</hi> thou hadſt need to have the <hi>art</hi>
of <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>repentance,</hi> or elſe thou
canſt not overtake them, for they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee much.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                  </label>
                  <hi>This may ſerve to condemns thoſe that
rely upon this example.</hi> Oh, ſaith one, did
not the Thief on the croſſe repent at the
laſt houre? and God is the ſame God ſtill;
and if he repented at thee laſt, why may
not I? How many wreſt this Scripture
to their own damnation? that live in ſin
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:38284:98"/>
with this Thief that went to heaven; yet
die and are damned, with the other Thief
that went to hell.</p>
               <p>I will demonſtrate this and make it
plain, becauſe I deſire to convince all that
hear me.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, tell me <hi>when this Thief was
converted?</hi> was it not when Chriſt hung
on the croſſe? <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 33. Chriſt hung
then on the croſſe, and was to be inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
King over all. Now, <hi>when Kings are
inaugurated into their kingdoms, they ſhew
that bounty, then, which they will not do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
all the time of their raigne.</hi> We have
of this a ſufficient ſtory in the Chronicles
of <hi>England,</hi> of King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, who
when he was inaugurated King, he created
55 Knights, he hung all the ſtreets and
lanes in <hi>London</hi> with cloth of gold, he
made all the Conduits in <hi>London</hi> to run
with Sack. Claret and White wine: this
he did when he was inaugurated King,
which he never did all his life time after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
Even ſo Chriſt was pleaſed to
ſhew mercy and grace unto this Thief,
unto life eternall, when he was inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
King over principalities and powers,
over hell and darkneſſe. Now as K. <hi>Henry</hi>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:38284:99"/>
never created ſo many Knights again<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
never hung <hi>London</hi> ſtreets ſo again, never
made the Conduits run ſo with wine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
even ſo the Lord ſhewed ſuch a
bounty then, as, for ought we know, he
never did before, nor will do the like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Kings when they are inau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurated,
they pardon ſuch offences, forgive
ſuch taxations, wrongs, injuries, treaſons
and fellonies, as they will never pardon again
as long as they live in the kingdome.</hi> So we
read of <hi>Charles</hi> the 3. King of <hi>France,</hi>
that day that he was crowned, he pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all thoſe that had ſinned againſt the
Crown, in what kinde ſoever they had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended;
Why? becauſe he was crowned
King, and ſo he would make <hi>that</hi> day a day
of rejoycing. And thus it was when Chriſt
triumphed over hell, he forgave the ſins of
this Thief, the like whereof we never read
of, and for ought we know will never do
the like again.</p>
               <p>3. Tell me <hi>where was this thief pardoned?</hi>
Was it not in Golgotha, where Chriſt was
crucified, the place where Chriſt did tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
where he was crowned, where he
forgave tranſgreſſions and ſins? there it
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:38284:99"/>
was where Chriſtpardoned him. Now as it
is with a Captain when he hath gotten the
victory, he will ſet up ſome monument at
the place, that it may be a token thereof;
ſo Chriſt having wrought the ſalvation of
the world, ſet up a monument there where
he wrought it, whereof none greater then
this could be, not the rending of the rocks,
nor the earthquake, nor any of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
beſides did ſo <hi>honour</hi> the death of
Chriſt, as the <hi>converſion</hi> of <hi>this Thief;</hi> who
like a Phyſitian having made an excellent
medicine, and deſirous to try it, will do
that for nothing; which he will not do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
for much: ſo Chriſt having made an
admirable ſoveraign plaiſter for the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mankinde, ſo ſoon as ever he had
made it, he makes an experiment thereof
on this Thief; as if he ſhould have ſaid,
Now you ſhall ſee what my death can do.
So then you ſee that the converſion of this
Thief was no ordinary, but an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
wonder.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>tell me how he cures by forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi>
not by bare repentance only, but by
repentance with <hi>Martyrdome;</hi> he did not
only nakedly repent of his ſin, but he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
alſo a <hi>Martyr</hi> for Chriſt; hee was a
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:38284:100"/>
Martyr on the croſſe; for although he
was firſt hung on the croſſe for his evill
deeds, yet afterwards when he repented
and confeſſed the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and
maintained him to be the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
<hi>Pilate, Herod,</hi> and the Jewes, by
publiſhing that he was unjuſtly cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
and that he was the ſon of God; I
ſay though at the firſt he was hung on
the croſſe for his ſin; yet <hi>now</hi> they let him
hang for his religion, as by their own law
it was manifeſt; for they had a law that
whoſoever confeſſed Chriſt, ſhould be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed;
ſo that now he confeſſing Chriſt,
they let him hang for his religion to
Chriſt, ſo that he died a Martyr; and
verſe 20. what a witneſſe he gave unto
Chriſt? The other anſwering, he rebuked
him, ſaying, Doſt not thou feare God? &amp;c.
As if he ſhould ſay, thou ſeeſt the Scribes
and Phariſees feare not God, they have
conſpired againſt the Son of God. The
Jewes that ſhould have beleeved on him
cryed crucifiy him; <hi>Herod:</hi> hath mocked
him, <hi>Pilate</hi> condemned him; doſt thou
not yet feare God? what not thou that
art in the ſtate of condemnation, thou
that art to be damned within this houre?
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:38284:100"/>
is it not enough for them to crucifie
Chriſt, but doſt not <hi>thou</hi> feare God nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
Oh what a witneſſe was this unto
Chriſt; no wonder if he found mercy
when it pleaſed the Lord to enlarge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
ſo in bringing his ſoule unto
him.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>
                  </label> But it may be objected, why is this
Scripture recorded, if I may not make
this uſe of it to repent as this thief did, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all Scripture is for our learning?</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> You know the common anſwer, <hi>it is once
recorded that none might deſpaire, and but
once, that none might preſume.</hi> Chriſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him at the laſt caſt, that when a man
is at that <hi>pinch</hi> hee might not <hi>deſpaire</hi> if he
<hi>repent</hi> and become a new creature; and
but <hi>one</hi> was ſaved that none might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume.</p>
               <p>There are many reaſons why this
Scripture is recorded.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>to ſhew the ſoveraignty of Chriſts
death,</hi> and as Chriſt healed all manner of
ſickneſſe in his life, ſo his death is able to
heale all manner of ſins; it is the leaves
of that tree only that can heale the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 2. and therefore the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſets downe a deſperate example of a
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:38284:101"/>
thief; for a man muſt be a deſperate man,
if he be a thief: and Chriſt did this to ſhew
that he can ſhew mercy even to a thief;
that ſo all the world may take notice of
the vertue of Chriſts death.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>it is recorded, that no poor ſoul
ſhould cry out of his ſinnes,</hi> ſaying, I am
damned, I am accurſed, I am more ſinfull
and graceleſſe then any man, more wicked
then any man. I ſay, do not thus reaſon;
for here is an example ſet down of the
thief, and you know what Chriſt ſaid to
the multitude, of a Thief; <hi>Do you come
unto me as to a thief, with ſwords and ſtaves?</hi>
as if he ſhould have ſaid, You deal baſely
with me, as if I were as bad as a thief, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying,
that a thief is the worſt of all men,
nay as bad as the devil, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 6. And it
is reckoned as one of their damnable
uſages againſt Chriſt, that they hung him
between two thieves, two of the vileſt
creatures of all: ſo that a thiefe is an
example of a deſperate man; and yet
you ſee Chriſt hath mercy, and gives it to
a <hi>thief;</hi> Therefore if the LORD
have enlarged thy heart to <hi>repent,</hi> be
not diſcouraged, but lay hold on
CHRIST.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:38284:101"/>
Thirdly, <hi>this Scripture is recorded, that
we may not caſt off all men that come to the
laſt caſt;</hi> all men, though great ſinners,
muſt not deſperately be caſt off: For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
a man have been a Drunkard, yet
prayer and ſupplication may be made to
God for him, and God may open his eyes,
and there is ſome poſſibility that he may
be ſaved, though it be a thouſand to one;
yet I ſay there is ſome <hi>poſſibilitie;</hi> for there
was one thief ſaved at the laſt caſt: and
therefore a Drunkard, &amp;c. is not to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
over for quite gone. It may be there
are a wonderfull company of <hi>improbabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
in it, yet we cannot tell but that this
may be the <hi>ſecond</hi> to whom the Lord will
give repentance, and therefore the Lord
converted this thief.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>this ſtory is recorded, that by it
we may be encouraged to believe, and to be
converted betimes.</hi> for if the Lord were
ſo willing to receive the <hi>thief</hi> that ſought
him but at the <hi>laſt</hi> houre, how willing
will he be then to receive thee that ſeekeſt
him <hi>betimes?</hi> But as for thee that liveſt in
thy ſins, and beareſt on the example of this
Thief; let me tell thee, this ſtory was
never penned for thy comfort. The Lord
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:38284:102"/>
knew how men would abuſe this ſtory;
therefore S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> S. <hi>Mark,</hi> and S. <hi>John</hi>
omit it; and if we had none to teſtifie it,
all the world would ſay both the theeves
were damned; nay, S. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith, the
thieves, <hi>both the thieves</hi> caſt the ſame thing
in his teeth: only S. <hi>Luke,</hi> he pens it for the
comfort of the godly; he was loth (as it
ſeems to me) to leave it out quite, becauſe
ſome poor ſoule might ſtand in need of it.
Therefore let me here rap off the fingers
of all thoſe that would lay hold on this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of the thief, to <hi>deferre</hi> their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
this ſtory belong not unto
ſuch.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>because this thief had not the means
of life and grace before;</hi> for where do
you read in all the goſpel, that ever this
Thiefe had the meanes of life? perhaps
when Chriſt was preaching, he was pilfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
where do you read that ever he heard
any of the Apoſtles, or Seventy, or <hi>John</hi>
the Baptiſt, or any Sermon in all his life?
No, no, he went roving up and down, we
have not one title to imply that he had the
<hi>means</hi> of ſalvation; and therefore this is
nothing to thee, that haſt the <hi>preaching of
the Word,</hi> which reproves thee of thy
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:38284:102"/>
ſins and therefore if thou wilt go on, thou
ſhalt dye, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 3. 19.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this ſtory belongs not unto
thee; for, <hi>where doſt thou read that ever this
thief did build upon this hope?</hi> do you think
that this thief ſaid I will ſteal as long as
I can, I know I ſhall be impriſoned, and
I ſhall be crucified with Chriſt, but while I
lie in priſon, I will repent, and then he will
have mercie on me? did this poor thief e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
dreame of theſe hopes; did he preſume
of mercie, and ſo ſin againſt mercies, and
therefore thou that <hi>buildeſt</hi> on this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
whoſoever thou art, it belongs not
unto thee.</p>
               <p>Tuſh, tuſh, ſayes the Drunkard ſhall I be
damned? the thief was ſaved. Thou cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
caitiffe, what though thou ſhouldſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and cry for mercie? art thou ſure the
Lord will heare and pardon thee? when I
ſpake to you ſaid <hi>Moſes,</hi> you would not
heare, but rebelled, and were preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous,
<hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 43. Doſt thou preſume
on Gods mercie that hee will convert thee
at the laſt? I tell thee that Gods mercy is
good mercie, it is not like the mercie of a
wicked Iudge; that is wickedly mercifull,
and ſuffers Rogues to be pardoned; No,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:38284:103"/>
no, Gods mercie is <hi>good, pſal.</hi> 109. 21.
<hi>mercie</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> are all one with God,
and they have all one name in ſcripture.
There is a crown laid up for me ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>
which the Lord, the <hi>juſt</hi> Judge ſhall give
me (<hi>viz</hi>) which God the <hi>mercifull</hi> Judge
ſhall give unto me; God is <hi>juſt</hi> in his <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi>
and therefore thinkeſt thou to live in
thy ſins, to ſweare, to lie, to be drunk, &amp;c.
and yet hope to have mercy? thou art
deceived; the Lords mercy is <hi>juſt</hi> mercy,
and he will damne thee for evermore, if
thou repent not in ſincerity. You never
read in the Scripture, that there is mercy in
the wayes of the devil: But, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 10.
all the wayes of the Lord are mercy and
iudgement, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So long as thou walkeſt
in the wayes of the Lord, there is mercy
to thee in every ſtep; mercy in Prayer,
mercy in hearing the Word, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the Sacraments; but in the wayes
of the devil there is no mercy; for as
long as thou walkeſt in darkneſſe, ſecurity,
and all ſinfull and vain courſes, which are
the wayes of the devil, there is no mercy
for thee; for, the Spirit of God ſaith,
thoſe that follow their vanities, forſake
their own mercies; you muſt turn from
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:38284:103"/>
your <hi>own</hi> wayes; for the way of mercy
lies in another road, in the road of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
humiliation, and repentance, in the
road of forſaking all your vain imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and thoughts; If thou follow thy
own wayes, God will have no mercy on
thee, <hi>Jonas</hi> 2. 8. He will not tell a lye, to
have mercy on thee: Gods mercy is true,
and <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> go together, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 98. 3.
Now if thou be a Drunkard, and doſt live
and die in that ſin, God hath ſaid that he
will damn thee, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 21. Now he ſhould
be a liar, if he ſhould not do it, and thou
knoweſt that mercy and truth go together
in him: Therefore in time repent. Piſh,
piſh, ſayes the Drunkard, &amp;c. I hope the
Lord will be more merciful; theſe Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
preach nothing but damnation, I
hope the Lord will pardon me. Pardon
thee; ſaith God? how ſhall I pardon thee
for this? Thy children have forſaken me,
and ſworne by them that are no gods, and
though I fed them to the full, yet they
committed adultery, and aſſembled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
by troopes in the harlots houſes,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 7. As if God ſhould have ſaid, I
cannot pardon thee. No: why? Thou
wilt not come at me, thou haſt forſaken
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:38284:104"/>
me in mine <hi>ordinances,</hi> &amp;c. Will a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian
cure a man that will not come at
him? why, they have forſaken me, ſaith
God, and they will not come at me; as if
he ſhould ſay, I am willing to pardon, I
ſend out my commandements, but they
will not bend their mindes to keep them,
they forſake theſe wayes of mercy. Have
mercy on them? nay, ſhall I not rather
viſit for theſe things, ſaith the Lord?
<hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 9. If thoſe that diſobeyed <hi>Moſes</hi> law
dyed without mercy, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. how then
lookeſt thou for mercy, that <hi>deſpiſeſt</hi> the
Lord Jeſus, even the goſpel of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome?
Nay, the croſſe of Chriſt cals thee,
he wooes thee by his death and paſſion,
and now it thou wilt not <hi>obey,</hi> thou ſhalt
die without mercy. Oh what a curſed
concluſion is this: I have a mercifull and
a good Father, and therefore I will lift up
my head againſt him; I know he will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
me; I will break my head, I know
where to have a plaiſter to heal it; I will
offer ſuch a man a wrong, I know he will
nnot ſue me? Thou curſed wretch! though
the Lord pardon ten thouſand, yet he will
not pardon thee; no, no, thou ſinneſt
with a high hand. But keep your ſelves in
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:38284:104"/>
the love of God, looking for the mercy
of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Jude</hi> 21. Keep
your ſelves there, if you be wiſe; for if
Gods patience be abuſed, it will be turned
into wrath and wormwood, and it will
burn like fire unto the nethermoſt hell:
to a man that ſins againſt <hi>mercy,</hi> there is no
redemption; this ſtory belongs not unto
ſuch.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this ſtory is nothing to thee,
becauſe <hi>at that time God was in a way of
working miracles,</hi> but now he is not in
that way; then he rent the rocks, opened
the ſepulchres, and raiſed the dead, &amp;c.
Now unleſſe thou take God in this way
again, never look to have thy ſinnes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
if thou goeſt on in thy ſinnes with
a high hand. It may be God will not be in
the way of working of miracles, when
thou art a dying; No, the Lord will ſhew
ſalvation to no man but unto him that
orders his converſation aright, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 23.
thy life muſt be right, and all thy wayes
muſt be <hi>upright,</hi> if thou mean to find
<hi>mercie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Thief was converted, without
ordering his wayes aright.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, one Swallow cannot make
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:38284:105"/>
Spring, nor one fair day a harveſt; One
example cannot make a rule, one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
concludes nothing. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
breakes no ſquare; but it is
onely hee that lives <hi>uprightly,</hi> that
ſhall ſee the ſalvation of God, and
none elſe. And if thou doſt mean to go
to heaven, thou muſt go in the <hi>way</hi> that
leads thither, and thou muſt do thoſe
things that are between thee and heaven:
there is but <hi>one</hi> way to heaven, and all
that go to heaven muſt walk <hi>that</hi> way;
there is <hi>one</hi> faith, <hi>one</hi> newneſſe of life, <hi>one</hi>
kinde of regeneration, and God will have
thee go all theſe over, he will have thee
run through every Commandement; all
that come to heaven muſt travell thither:
therefore never beare thy ſelf on this or
that example, for 'tis a wonder of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
one of the miracles of Chriſts
paſſion.</p>
               <p>I remember the ſtory of an ancient
Confeſſor which proved a worthy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,
300 years after the Apoſtles time:
this man was an old man, and had been a
Pagan all his dayes, and in his old age he
hearkened after Chriſt, and ſaid he would
be a Chriſtian. <hi>Simplinus</hi> hearing him ſay
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:38284:105"/>
ſo, would not believe him; but when the
Church ſaw him to be a Chriſtian <hi>indeed,</hi>
there was ſhouting and dancing for glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and Pſalmes were ſung in every
Church, <hi>Caius Marius Victorius</hi> is become
a Chriſtian: this was written for a <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
that he in his <hi>old</hi> age and in his gray
haires ſhould become a <hi>good</hi> Chriſtian;
ſo this is a great wonder, and an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
example, that this Thiefe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.
Do you not think that there were
a thouſand thieves that at that time lived
and dyed in their ſins, and ſo were damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
Were there not many widows in the
dayes of <hi>Eliah,</hi> and yet to none of them
was he ſent but to the widow of <hi>Sarepha?</hi>
Were there not many Lepers in the dayes
of <hi>Eliſha?</hi> yet none of them were cleanſed
ſaving <hi>Naaman</hi> the Syrian. So there were
many thouſands at that time, and yet for
all that we know they were all damned,
only this one is excepted. Now, ſhall a
man ruſh into a den of Lyons, becauſe
<hi>Daniel</hi> did eſcape? or will a man caſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
into a fiery furnace, becauſe the three
Children were caſt in and had no hurt?
Shall a man venture to caſt avvay his juels
or his purſe, becauſe one among a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:38284:106"/>
did ſo, and found it again? No, no,
theſe are wonders, and therefore beare
not thy ſelf on this, or the like example.</p>
               <p>The common rule is this, <hi>Live in ſinne,
and die in ſinne;</hi> you that live in ſinne
now, ſhall then be damned in ſinne for
ever, if you repent not. St. <hi>Paul</hi> knew
well that this thief was converted; and
yet he ſaith, <hi>Be not deceived, neither Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
nor Fornicators, nor Theeves, &amp;c. <hi>ſhall
inherit the kingdom of God.</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10.
St. <hi>Peter</hi> alſo knew that this thief was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
yet ſaith he, <hi>If the righteous ſcarcely
be ſaved? where ſhall the ſinners and ungodly
appeare?</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 9. St. <hi>Iames</hi> alſo knew
this ſtory, Jam. 5. 12. yet if we <hi>ſweare,</hi>
we may fall into condemnation. This is
a moſt ſweet example, if by it we return
unto God; but thou makeſt a damned uſe
of it, if by it thou makeſt thy ſelf <hi>ſecure</hi> in
thy ſinfull courſes, hoping to be ſaved at
the laſt, as this thief was. Conſider with
your ſelves, wherefore are the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God? are they, think you, to be
diſobeyed while men live, and then when
men are dying, to cry God mercy?
Again, why hath God given you Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
to preach the Word of eternal life?
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:38284:106"/>
Never to preach it to men till they are a
dying? No, no, deceive not thy ſelf;
thou muſt hear Gods Miniſters preach
whilſt thou art <hi>well.</hi> What, hath God given
you dayes, that you ſhould ſpend your
lives in ſin? No, no; ſaith God, I gave
her <hi>time</hi> to repent, but ſhe repented not,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 21. And this is the leaſon that God
gives thee time; That thou mighteſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.
The Lord could have ſent thee to
hell as ſoon as thou waſt borne, but that
in mercy he gives thee life and time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
that ſo thou mayeſt find forgiveneſſe
with God, and chat thou mayeſt become a
new creature, before thou go hence and
be no more ſeen. You that think to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
reſting on the example of this thief,
take heed leſt the Lord put you off: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
labour to <hi>obey</hi> whilſt it is called <hi>to day,</hi>
and make uſe of the Word whilſt it is
ſounded in your eares, before theſe things
be hid from your eyes.</p>

<hi>The whole need not the phyſitian, but
they that are ſick.</hi> The hearts that are whole,
need not the phyſitian, but they that are
broken and ſick. Sinne is in the godly, and
they are ſick of it; even as when poyſon
is in a man, it makes him ſick; why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the poyſon is contrary unto him.
But ſinne is in the wicked, and they are
not <hi>ſick</hi> of it; as poyſon is in a toad, and
the toad is not ſick, becauſe a toad is of
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:38284:109"/>
that nature which the poyſon is; and
therefore he needs not a phyſitian. Will
a Phyſitian go to cure a Toad? ſurely no,
he will rather kill it, he wilt not cure it.
So, as long as a man is not ſick at the <hi>heart</hi>
of his ſin, Chriſt will rather kill him than
<hi>cure</hi> him. When a man ſayes he is ſick, and
yet can ſleep, eat, drink, and work, and
look as well as ever he did, feels no pain,
nor any thing to trouble him, what need
hath this man of a phyſitian? So when a
man lives in ſinne, yet never breaks his
ſleep for it, but mindes his pleaſures, his
profits, hath never the more pain nor an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
in his ſoule, he is <hi>ſoule-whole,</hi> and
heart-whole, what need hath he of a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian?
This is a man <hi>whole</hi> in his ſins.</p>
               <p>The wholeneſſe of the heart is called
<hi>fallow-ground,</hi> Jer. 4. 4. for it is like an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken
field, not tilled nor manured;
there can be no harveſt, becauſe the ground
doth lie fallow; ſo there can be no harveſt
of <hi>grace</hi> in that man, whoſe heart is fallow
and unbroken; and therefore to repent
and to break the heart, in Scripture is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the putting of ones hand to the plough,
<hi>Luke</hi> 9. 62. to plough up the fallow ground
of the heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:38284:110"/>
Brokenneſſe of heart may be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
two wayes; Firſt, <hi>in relation to whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of heart in ſinne:</hi> ſo brokenneſſe of
heart is not a maladie; but an inchoative
cure of a deſperate maladie.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>in relation to wholeneſſe of
heart from ſinne;</hi> and ſo it is a maladie or
ſickneſſe, and yet peculiar to one blood
alone, namely Gods <hi>elect;</hi> for though the
heart be whole, yet it is broken for its ſins:
as a man that hath a barbed arrow ſhot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his ſide, and the arrow is pluckt out of
the fleſh, yet the wound is not preſently
healed; ſo ſinne may be pluckt out of
the heart, but the ſcar that was made with
plucking it out, is not yet cured. The
wounds that are yet under cure, are the
plagues and troubles of conſcience, the
ſighs and groanes of a hungering ſoule
after grace, the ſtinging poyſon that the
blow hath left behind it; theſe are the
wounds.</p>
               <p>Now the heart is broken three wayes.
Firſt, <hi>by the Law:</hi> as it breaks the heart of
a thief to heare the ſentence of the Law,
that he muſt be hanged for his robbery;
ſo it breaks the heart of the ſoule, ſenſible
to underſtand the ſentence of the Law:
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:38284:110"/>
Thou ſhalt not ſin; if thou do, thou ſhalt
be damned. If ever the heart come to be
ſenſible of this ſentence, <hi>Thou art a damned
man,</hi> it is impoſſible to ſtand out under it,
but it muſt break. <hi>Is not my word a ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
that breaks the rocks in peeces?</hi> Jer. 23.
29. that is, Is not my word, my Law a
hammer? Can any rock-heart hold out
and not be broken with the blowes of it?
Indeed thus far a man may be broken, and
yet be a reprobate; for they ſhall be all
thus broken in hell, and therefore this
breaking is not enough.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>by the Goſpel;</hi> for if ever the
heart come to be ſenſible of its blow, it
will break ail to ſhatters. <hi>Rent your hearts,
for the Lord is gracious,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 12.
When all the ſhakes of Gods mercy come,
they all cry, <hi>rent.</hi> Indeed the heart can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſtand out againſt them, if it once feel
them: Beat thy ſoule upon the Goſpel:
if any way under heaven can break it, this
is the way.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerves, that a hammer may
eaſily break a hard ſtone againſt a ſoft bed;
but if it be laid on an anvil, which will not
give way underneath, ſtrike it as hard as
you will with the hammer on the top, the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:38284:111"/>
anvil underneath props it from breaking,
or if it do break, it will not break into
ſhatters; for the anvil below helps the
ſtone to hang faſt together: but if you
ſmite it againſt a ſoft bed, it breaks it all to
ſhatters. So, ſmite thy ſoule upon the
Goſpel; preach the Law as much as you
will, preach hell and damnation as much
as you will, let that be the hammer; but
then be ſure lay thy ſoule on the Goſpel,
drive it to the Goſpel, ſmite againſt this
ſoft bed, and then (if ever) it will break.
If you ſtrike a ſtone againſt a hard anvil,
though the parts thereof would fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder,
yet how can they flie off, when as
the hard anvil will not give way? the
hard anvil on the one ſide, and the hard
hammer on the other ſide, ſtop up its way
from falling aſunder, So, ſtrike the ſoule
with the blowes of Gods wrath as much
as you will, and let it be upon the Law;
alas whither ſhould the Law open it ſelf
that it might break? the Law doth but
fear it on the one ſide, and the wrath of
God doth terrifie it on the other, yet all
this while it is not broken; the ſoule all
this while knowes not what it ſhall doe:
but ſmite it on the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and this, with
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:38284:111"/>
the Law, rents it and breaks it indeed. So
<hi>Ioel</hi> he preached hell and damnation to the
people of the Jews, and laid their hearts
upon mercie, and then the hammer cries
<hi>rent;</hi> for he is mercifull, &amp;c. he laid them
on the ſoft bed of the Goſpel, and then he
ſmites them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>the heart is broken by the skill
of the Miniſter</hi> in the handling of theſe two,
the Law, and the Goſpel: God furniſheth
him with skill to preſſe the Law home,
and gives him underſtanding how to put
to the Goſpel, and by this means doth
God break up the heart: For alas, though
the Law be never ſo good a hammer, and
although the Goſpel be never ſo ſoft a bed,
yet if the Miniſter lay not the ſoul upon it
the heart will not break; he muſt fetch a
full ſtroke with the Law, and he muſt ſet
the full power of the Goſpel at the back of
the ſoul, or elſe the heart will not break.</p>
               <p>It is a pretty obſervation of <hi>Aristotle,</hi>
Lay (ſaith he) an axe upon a block, and a
great and mighty weight upon it, yet it
will not enter into the block to cleave it;
but if you lift up the axe and fetch a full
blow at the block, then it enters preſently.
So if the Miniſter have not <hi>skill</hi> to fetch a
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:38284:112"/>
dead blow at the heart, alas he may be
long enough ere he break it; but let him
fetch a full blow at the ſoule, then doth he
break it, if ever. I took unto me two ſtaves,
ſaith the Prophet, the one I called <hi>beauty,</hi>
the other I called <hi>bands,</hi> and with theſe I
fed the flock, <hi>Zach.</hi> 11. 7. There is the
courſe of a true feeder of the flock, he
feeds them with the <hi>Law</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel;</hi>
he takes his two ſtaves, and he layes about
him, till the hearts of his hearers feel him:
and this is the way to feed them, and to
break them off from their ſins. Thus you
ſee the means that God uſeth to break your
hearts. <hi>He healeth the broken in heart.</hi>
Hence obſerve,</p>
               <p>That <hi>Chriſt juſtifies and ſanctifies.</hi> For
that is the meaning.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe <hi>God hath given Chriſt
grace to practice for the ſakes of the broken
in heart;</hi> and therefore if this be his grace,
to heal the broken-hearted, certainly he
will heal them. <hi>The ſpirit of the lord is
upon me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He hath ſent me to heal the
broken in heart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luk.</hi> 4. 18. If he be
<hi>created</hi> maſter of this art, even for this
purpoſe, to heale the broken in heart,
he will verily heale them, and none but
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:38284:112"/>
them. He is not like <hi>Hoſander</hi> and <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates,</hi>
whoſe father appointed them
both to be Phyſitians; he appointed his
ſonne <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to be a phyſitian of
horſes, yet he proved a phyſitian for men;
he appointed <hi>Hoſander</hi> to be a phyſitian
for men, and he proved a phyſitian for
horſes. He is not like theſe; no, no, he
will heale thoſe whom he was appointed
to heale: now God appointed him to
heale thee that art broken in heart, and
therefore without doubt he will do it.</p>
               <p>2. Becauſe <hi>Chriſt hath undertaken to do it.</hi>
When a skilful Phyſitian hath undertaken
a cure, he will ſurely do it: indeed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a good phyſitian may fail, as <hi>Trajans</hi>
phyſitian did, for he died under his hands;
on whoſe tomb this was written, Here lies
<hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperour, that may thank his
Phyſitian that he died. But if Chriſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
it, thou maieſt be ſure of it, for he tels
thee that art <hi>broken in heart,</hi> that he hath
undertaken it, he hath felt thy pulſe already
<hi>Thus ſaith the high and holy one whoſe name is
holy; I dwell in the high and holy place,
and with him that if of an humble and
broken ſpirit, &amp;c.</hi> Iſa. 57. 15. He doth
not only undertake it, but he ſaith he
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:38284:113"/>
will go <hi>viſit</hi> his ſick patient; he will come
to thy bed-ſide, yea he will come and
dwell with thee all the time of thy ſicknes;
thou ſhalt never want any thing, but he
will be ready to help thee: thou needeſt
not complain and ſay, Oh the Phyſitian
is too far off, he will not come at me. I
dwell in the high places indeed, ſaith God,
but yet I will come and dwell with thee
that art of an humble ſpirit. Thou needeſt
not fear, ſaying, Will a man cure his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies?
I have been an enemy to Gods
glory, and will he yet cure me? yea, ſaith
Chriſt, if thou be <hi>broken in heart,</hi> he will
bind thee up.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, becauſe <hi>this is Chriſts charge,</hi>
and he will look to his own calling; To
this man will I look, even to him that is
of a broken heart, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. 2. Mark; I will
<hi>look</hi> to him, I will tend him and keep him.
Neither needeſt thou feare thine own po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertie,
becauſe thou haſt not a Fee to give
him; for thou maieſt come to him by
way of begging, he will look to thee for
nothing; For, <hi>to him will I look that is
poor,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>none but the broken in heart
will take Phyſick of Chriſt.</hi> Now this is a
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:38284:113"/>
Phyſitians deſire, that his Patient would
caſt himſelfe upon him; if he will not,
the Phyſitian hath no deſire to meddle
with him. Now none but the broken in
heart will take ſuch Phyſick as Chriſt gives,
and therefore he ſaith, <hi>to him will I look that
is of a broken heart, and trembles at my
words,</hi> Eſay 66. 2. When I bid him take
ſuch a purge ſaith God, he trembles, and
he takes it. I bid him take ſuch a bitter
Potion, or ſuch an untoothſome vomit, to
feare him from ſinne; he trembles at my
word, and he dares not but off with it:
But when a ſoule doth not tremble, then
the Phyſitian may ſay let him bloud; but
he cares not for being let bloud; he cares
not for corroſives, he cares not for his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
and counſell, he trembles not at his
word; Chriſt will never come at ſuch a one;
Chriſt bids thee follow ſuch a diet as to
<hi>watch,</hi> to <hi>pray,</hi> to <hi>faſt,</hi> to <hi>mourne,</hi> &amp;c. to
keep in and to take heed to catechizing,
grow not cold by being lukewarme, &amp;c. If
thou <hi>tremble</hi> at his word, well; If not, but
that thou wilt go on in thy ſinnes, and be
damned for ever, then thank thine owne
wilfulneſſe. But if thou beeſt broken in
heart, Chriſt will aſſuredly heale thee. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:38284:114"/>
thou ſhouldeft come unto Chriſt,
be his phyſick never ſo ſoveraign, and thou
ſhouldſt take it: yet if thy heart be againſt
it, the phyſick cannot work. <hi>Imagination</hi>
or <hi>fancie</hi> is a great thing in the good or ill
ſucceſſe of phyſick. If thou carpe at his
precepts, as too ſtrict, and except againſt
his word as if it had an ounce of worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood
too much in it; If thy imaginations
thus run againſt the phyſick, Chriſts phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
will never cure thee; why ſo? thou
art not broken in heart, to tremble at his
word; he will help thee without faile;
but then thou muſt <hi>tremble</hi> at his word,
and take his directions, though he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
thee to eate thine owne dung, and
drink thine owne piſſe; take it I ſay what
ever it be, and I will warrant thee health.</p>

quantity of faith, becauſe it hath more of

faith whether it be great or ſmall, ſo it be

doubt of his recovery becauſe of the ſmall
meaſure of phyſick that the Phyſitian
gives him? The Phyſitian gives but a
dram of ſuch powder, but perhaps the
Patient would have a pound, when as it
may be the ſtate of his body will not bear
it. The Phyſitian obſerves his meaſures
in preſcribing ſo many ounces of this, ſo
many ſcruples of that; there lies his skill
in giving the true meaſure; ſo there is a
true meaſure of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 3. one man

ſo much faith. <hi>Abraham</hi> had more faith

               </p>
               <p>A Phyſitian finds it dangerous ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

                  </label> Haſt thou a grounded reſolution to ſeek
after God come what can come of it? Doſt
thou deſire and long to be united with
Chriſt? Then let me tell thee, ſuppoſe
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:38284:117"/>
thou haſt no faith yet in <hi>being,</hi> yet thou
haſt ſomething to ſecure thee from wrath;
there is difference between <hi>Fides creditura</hi>
and <hi>Fides credens,</hi> between faith <hi>about to
beleeve,</hi> and faith that doth <hi>already</hi> beleeve.
<hi>It is belief believing</hi> that ſaves a man: But
<hi>belief about to believe,</hi> cures a man from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a reprobate. Though the fruit in the
wombe be not yet quickened with <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable</hi>
ſoule, yet it growes in the wombe,
feeds in the wombe, and yet it hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
life in it then may bee in a beaſt; yet
becauſe it is <hi>in fieri</hi> a man, the Mother
complaines not ſaying Oh I am afraid I
have a beaſt in my wombe; no, ſhe will
wait Gods leiſnre to quicken it; it is ſecure
enough from being a beaſt; for it hath
ſuch diſpoſitions as will not long be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the ſoule of a man in the ſame, though
as yet there be nothing in it, but what may
be in a beaſt; But yet the Mother is ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
becauſe ſhe is perſwaded ſhee beares a
babe in her wombe. So many poor ſoules
are too haſty to cenſure themſelves; for
grant thou haſt no faith as <hi>yet,</hi> yet if thou
beeſt <hi>broken</hi> in heart, thou art <hi>about to
have faith;</hi> only let the word have his full
work on thee, unto which thou muſt
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:38284:117"/>
diligently attend, and then this <hi>fides in fieri</hi>
will be quickly <hi>fides in factum eſſe.</hi> Thus
the blind man in the Goſpell was <hi>about to
beleeve before</hi> he beleeved; he had a time
of a <hi>fieri</hi> of faith; he was no beleever this
time; for he had as yet no faith; neither
was hee an unbeleever; for he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to beleeve. <hi>Doſt thou beleeeve on the
Son of God?</hi> ſaith Chriſt <hi>John</hi> 9. 35. he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<hi>who is hee Lord that I might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
on him?</hi> verſe 39. Beleeve? yea that
I would with all my heart, who is he, and
where is hee that I might beleeve? I have
been hated for his names ſake, I have been
caſt out of the Synagogue for his ſake;
Lord thou knoweſt I would beleeve on
him; but who is hee and where is hee? and
he is vaniſhed away from me; I have
ſought him; but I cannot find him. Then
Chriſt told him, I am hee that now tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
with thee; and then he beleeved;
and Saint <hi>Chryſtome</hi> obſervs that this blind
man was <hi>about to beleeve,</hi> before he did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
it in his ſoule; and ſo it may be it is
now with thee; doſt thou beleeve in
Chriſt? who is hee? ſaieſt thou, where
ſhall I find that Chriſt is in me that I may
beleeve in him? I weep and hunger, and
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:38284:118"/>
I thirſt after Chriſt; but <hi>who</hi> and <hi>where</hi> is
hee? I have ſought him in the word; but
I find him not; I have ſought him in
prayer and in all other his ordinances; but
I find him not; I would beleeve with all
my heart if I could find him. Thus the
ſoule may be <hi>about to beleeve,</hi> though it
doe not already beleeve; haſt thou gotten
this ſame <hi>about to beleeve?</hi> be not thou diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed,
the plaiſter is come; and it will
heal thee.</p>
               <p>Conceive theſe words aright I beſeech
you; a ſpeech is not as it is taken, I mean
only the <hi>broken</hi> in heart; for otherwiſe a
man may be <hi>about to beleeve,</hi> yet never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve;
about to be healed of his ſins, yet
never be healed. Even like the wretch
that <hi>Zophar</hi> ſpeakes of, who ſhall be about
to fill his belly, and not be able to fill it,
<hi>Job</hi> 20. 23.</p>
               <p>There is a twofold <hi>about to bee;</hi> Firſt,
either ſuch a thing as is <hi>about to bee,</hi> and
that is the nature of it, and it <hi>will never be
otherwiſe;</hi> but ſtill only about to bee. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
or els ſuch a thing as is <hi>about to be,</hi>
and that is the <hi>progreſſe</hi> of it, and not
to reſt there, bun at the laſt <hi>to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:38284:118"/>
Fear you then, all you that are vain, and
as yet in your ſins; you are <hi>about to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve,</hi>
and that is the nature of your faith;
it is only about to beleeve; like the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of the next yeare, who are about to
be officers and yet are not. Beloved, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
look to bee healed, if you be not <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi>
in heart; It may be thou art broken
from <hi>ſome</hi> of thy ſins; but if thou be not
broken from them <hi>all,</hi> it is nothing; and
thou cauſt not be healed. Alas thou maiſt
be broken in <hi>ſome</hi> ſence, and yet never be
healed. There is a <hi>double</hi> breaking, ſaith
<hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> either breaking into <hi>great parts,</hi>
as wood is broken into logs; or breaking
into <hi>ſmall parts,</hi> as a ſtone is broken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
powder; it may bee thy ſtony heart is
broken, but it is only into leſſer <hi>ſtones,</hi>
thou art fallen from greater ſins to leſſer,
from bouzing and company keeping, to
drinking and ſipping; from playing and
gaming on the Sabbath, to talking of
worldly affaires on the Sabbath; from
praying not at all, to pray coldly. Alas,
alas thou haſt a <hi>hard heart</hi> ſtill; when a
great ſtone is broken into leſſer ſtones, the
leſſer ſtone is as hard as the great ſtone;
thy heart muſt bee broken to <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:38284:119"/>
if ever God heale thee.</p>
               <p>Firſt, becauſe <hi>Phyſick wil never cure a man,
unleſſe it may enter and run into the veines;</hi>
and when it is entred into the body, and
diffuſed up and down through all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed
parts thereof, then it cures; now if
thy heart be not <hi>broken,</hi> the Phyſick can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
enter; give a purgation to a ſtone, it
may moyſten the outſide, but it cannot
ſoake in, to ſoften the ſtone; why, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the ſtone is cloſe; but if the ſtone
were broken into powder, then it would
ſoake even into the heart of the ſtone.</p>
               <p>God opened the heart of <hi>Lydia,</hi> and then
the word entred. <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 14. Brethren,
you have been under the hands of Chriſts
Phyſitians ever ſince you were borne; but
where is the heart that is broken? all the
Phyſick is loſt, the word hath no entrance,
it hath ſkinned the wound; and ſeared
the outſide indeed; but the hardneſſe of
the <hi>heart</hi> is not cured. How long have
you been under Phyſick for the curing of
your earthlineſſe and vanity? how long
have you lien by it for your anger and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
&amp;c. under the means, yet never the
neerer? whoſe hearts are broken? I feare
the Phyſick doth not ſoake, it comes no
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:38284:119"/>
neerer then the outſide. The Lord is
nigh unto them that are of a broken heart
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 34. 18. why? becauſe their hearts
are <hi>open</hi> and broken, and Chriſt and his
word comes neere, yea ſo neere that it
toucheth them to the quick; But if yee be
not <hi>broken</hi> in heart, no Balme, no Phyſick
can come neare enough to cure you.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>thou canſt never be cured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
Chriſt cure thee;</hi> now Chriſt will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
take thee in hand till thou be <hi>broken</hi> in
heart. A Phyſitian will not meddle with
a <hi>deſperate</hi> cure, ſuch a one who is not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Phyſick. Let not any Phyſitian
ſaith <hi>Hippocrates</hi> ſet upon a <hi>fruitleſſe</hi> cure.
Now it is fruitles to give thee any Phyſick
it is fruitleſſe to poure grace into thee, or
to vouchſafe pardon to thee; this Phyſick
will never heal thee ſo long as thou art not
<hi>broken</hi> in heart; and therefore Chriſt ſcorns
to take thee in hand. True it is if thou wert
<hi>broken</hi> in heart, God would not deſpiſe
thee; for the ſacrifice of God is a broken
ſpirit; ſo ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>A broken and
a contrite heart O God ſhalt thou not deſpiſe,</hi>
Pſal. 51. 17. ſo then if thy heart be not yet
<hi>broken</hi> it is yet incurable. Indeed if we
conſider Chriſts <hi>abſolute</hi> power, no heart
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:38284:120"/>
is uncurable; for he can heale it what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it bee, for all is at his command. But
God doth not go according to his <hi>abſolute</hi>
power, but according to his expreſſion and
meaning of, and in his word; now the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
that God <hi>ſets down</hi> in his word, is thus;
<hi>firſt the heart muſt be broken and then it muſt
or way be healed;</hi> ſo then ſo long as thou
art not <hi>broken</hi> in heart, thou art incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>ſuppoſe Chriſt ſhould begin to
heal thee, thou being not broken in heart, wilt
alwayes be taking off the plaiſter before thou
be cured;</hi> ſometimes God terrifies thee
with the law, and then thou pulleſt off
that plaiſter; Even like unto a dainty
Dame, who having taken phyſick, and
feeling it begin to wamble in her ſtomack,
puts a feather in her throat to cauſe her
to vomit it up before it have its <hi>full</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
And thus many take hopes and
comforts and promiſes before the ſet
time.</p>
               <p>In ſome phyſick, a quarter of an houres
difference may coſt one his life; when a
man is to be cut of the ſtone and he bee
bound hand and foot, yet if he doe but
ſtirre or ſtruggle before the Chirurgion
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:38284:120"/>
hath quite done with him, it is a thouſand
to one but he dies for it; ſo they in the
ſecond Pſalme had a ſtone in the heart;
Chriſt would have cut them for the ſtone,
but they would not be bound, they would
not endure their cutting, no let us break
his bonds aſunder, and caſt away his cords
from us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. 3. men cannot be ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
at a Sermon, but oh they muſt preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have comfort; as ſoon as once the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
beginnes to make the head to <hi>ake,</hi> and
the ſtomack to be ſick, and the man to be
exceeding ill, it is a ſigne that the phyſick
doth now begin to <hi>worke;</hi> but if this man
ſhould deviſe how to vomit it up, or to
gliſter it out, he looſeth all the <hi>benefit</hi> of
the phyſick; keep this plaiſter on as long
as thou canſt, if ever thou meane to be
healed. If the wound be throughly whole,
the plaiſter will fall away of it ſelf. Should
a man have never ſo good a plaiſter
and ſhould every foot be taking it off, it
would never do him any good. If God
have ſhot an arrow into thy heart, bind
the plaiſter to the ſore, and let it there reſt
till the <hi>malignity</hi> of the ſore and venom of
the wound be put out. But if thou be not
broken in heart, it is in vain to miniſter or
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:38284:121"/>
to ſay any thing unto thee, becauſe thou
wilt not abide the phyſick within thee, nor
ſuffer the gripes that thou muſt ſuffer if e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
thou be <hi>healed.</hi> And therefore all you
that are <hi>broken</hi> in heart, in any <hi>meaſure</hi> or
<hi>manner,</hi> be of good cheer, the Lord will
heal you; he health the broken in
heart.</p>
               <p>See here theſe particulars.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>for the ſeaſonableneſſe of it,</hi> when it
is a ſeaſonable time to be healed, and that
is when the heart is in <hi>need,</hi> and it is in
need when it is broken; as a man is in
need of meat, when hee is hungry; ſo a
man is in need of meat, when hee is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in heart: God will give thee that
which thou needeſt, and that in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſayes <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> In an <hi>acceptable time
have I heard thee,</hi> Eſay 49. 8. God lookes
when it will be moſt <hi>ſeaſonable</hi> to give
grace, and then he gives it; therefore wait,
never complaine of Gods delaying his
hand; if he do, it is but for a <hi>better</hi> ſeaſon;
I have need of healing <hi>already</hi> ſayeſt thou;
but if God do nor <hi>yet</hi> heal thee, then thou
muſt know it is not yet <hi>ſeaſonable,</hi> and the
more need thou art in, the better wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
is help when it commeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:38284:121"/>
Secondly, <hi>when it is moſt profitable for
thee;</hi> when he is broken in heart, it will
do him good to be healed; but if God
ſhould heale thee before, it would hurt
thee; when the <hi>Corroſive</hi> hath wrought
out his worke, then it is good to have a
<hi>Cordiall;</hi> now the Cordiall will help the
man; but if the Phyſitian ſhould give him
a Cordiall firſt, it would helpe the <hi>diſeaſe,</hi>
and endamage the man. Comfortable Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials
before the time have bin the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of many ſoules. Oh thou wouldſt
fain have comfort for thy ſoule; what? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Corroſive</hi> hath eaten out the ſin?
thou wiſheſt thine own poyſon; If God let
thee wait for thy healing, underſtand
that he doth it for thy good; only let his
<hi>Corroſives</hi> work their full courſe, and then
he will heal thee. Wait on the Lord ſaith
<hi>David</hi> Pſal. 27. 14. give not over wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
how long ſo ever it be, and he will
heal thee aſſuredly when it ſhall be beſt
for thee.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>in puncto, euen juſt in the very
nick of thy brokenneſſe in heart will his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
come.</hi> It is well obſerved that the
word in the originall is put in the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
indifferent to any time, whether paſt,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:38284:122"/>
preſent or to come, he doth not ſet down
<hi>any</hi> time, becauſe he will doe it <hi>punctually,</hi>
juſt at the pinch, when thou art <hi>broken</hi> in
heart; Oh then if thou be not yet healed,
know then that thou art not yet come to
this <hi>punctum;</hi> but when thou art come to
it, then thou ſhalt be healed. What if thou
doſt lie under the heavy and frowning
hand of God? doe not ſhake it off, but
kiſſe that rod, &amp; humble thy ſelf the more:
Sometimes God lets a <hi>broken heart</hi> ſhake
off his hand a little too ſoon, ſometimes
again he will not let them. <hi>David</hi> would
faine have ſhaken it off; but he could not;
God would not let him. Lord rebuke
me not in thine anger, ſaith hee, &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi>
38. 1, 2. How did he know that Gods ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
ſtuck in him faſt? It ſeemes that he
had been pulling at them; he would faine
have had them out, he would have been
comforted all on the ſuddaine, but he
could not; God would not let him. Lord
rebuke me not (ſayes he) in thine indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
&amp;c. Rebuke meas much as thou
wilt, but let it not be in thine <hi>indignation;</hi>
chaſten me as much as thou wilt, but let
it not be in thy heavy diſpleaſure. Oh
pluck out thine arrowes, take off thy hand;
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:38284:122"/>
I pluck at them, but they ſtick faſt; I
ſhake and rub to get off thy hand, but it
preſſeth me ſo ſore that I cannot get it off.
Beloved, it is neceſſary that ſome while
Gods own people ſhould <hi>bleed</hi> under Gods
wrath; for by this means the corruption
of ſin is purged out. Thus you ſee in ſome
God will not let them ſhake off his hand;
others, if they will needs have it off, they
ſhall, that they may afterwards ſee their
own folly. Thus many a poor childe of
God, in conflict of conſcience and ſenſe of
Gods wrathfull diſpleaſure, ſcrapes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
too ſoon, and God lets them take it
before he gives it: he would have had
them firſt <hi>throughly</hi> cured, but they were
loth to be humbling their ſoules ſo long:
but ſee the event of it, the ſore is only
skinned over, and at the laſt the wound
it breaks forth afreſh, and then it may be
they lie ſeven years together and get no
comfort, yea ſometimes twenty yeares,
yea, I have known ſome that have lived
ſo thirty yeares. Now they may thank
their own folly; for if they would have
been ruled by Chriſt, and been humbled
all together at the firſt; they might
have eſcaped this ſcouring; but now they
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:38284:123"/>
repent it every veine in their hearts, and
can hardly claw it off untill death. I call
theſe the children of God, becauſe they
have lyen a long while under Gods hand,
and yet ſtil cry after God, it is a ſigne they
are his children; for Gods children are
many times in affliction a long while; ſee
it in <hi>Job,</hi> &amp;c. Neither can I belive, but
that all thoſe that lie ſundry yeares on this
faſhion ſtill crying after God, are the
children of God; or at the leaſt, it is ſo
to be hoped: for if they were reprobates,
and had ſhaken off Gods hand, pluckt out
his arrows, and ſcraped after comfort, he
would either let them fall into a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
fools-paradiſe of preſumption or ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
or elſe let them moulder away in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire,
not caring to ſeek after God in the
means at all. And therefore, beloved,
pluck not out Gods arrowes too ſoon: I
ſpeak net to all, for ſome will not pluck
them out when they ſhould; but I ſpeak
to all ſuch as are over-haſtie for to get
Cordials before the Corroſive have had
his full working. If men be never ſo little
humbled, reformed, or wrought upon,
preſently they think they be in very good
caſe: the very Heathen could ſay, we are
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:38284:123"/>
commonly deceived with ſeeming vertue
and grace; and hence it is that wicked
men are humbled by halves, They think,
they are throughly humbled, when their
hearts are broken by halves; they think
they are broken in heart. And as a ſtick
that is half in the water, and half above
the water, ſeems to be broken or bent in
the middeſt; ſo theſe men when they are
half in their ſinnes, and half out, ſeem to
themſelvs to be broken-hearted: But if the
ſtick were either al in the water, or al out,
would appeare as it is: it ſeemes to be
broken, when as it is not: ſo, many being
half in their ſinnes, and half out, ſeem to
be <hi>broken-hearted,</hi> when indeed they
are not.</p>
               <p>But (beloved) before I can give you
the <hi>healing</hi> here in, this Text, it is good
reaſon that I examine you whether you
be broken in heart, or no. <hi>Prognoſtica prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedunt
Therapeuticen,</hi> ſayes <hi>Argaſtus;</hi>
Prognoſtiques, and telling the ſignes and
ſymptomes of the diſeaſe, are before the
healing of the diſeaſe. When we believe
a thing to be ſo, we have a proverb to ſay
'<hi>tis a ſigne 'tis ſo.</hi> Doeſt thou ſay thou
art broken in heart? 'Tis a ſigne 'tis ſo,

If a man cannot caſt thy water on this

               <p>Firſt, <hi>a breaking from ſin,</hi> as a rotten

the heart is then ſaid to be broken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
when it is broken off from
ſin.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>a breaking in it ſelfe,</hi> ſo that
the heart is ſaid to be broken when it is
broken with ſorrow and ſelfe-denyall, ſo
that nothing can peice it up againe, but
the favour of God. Theſe two made up a
broken heart, and therefore they ſhall be
the heads of examination.</p>
               <p>Firſt, then doe <hi>thy ſins goe thick away
from thee?</hi> when the cold is once broken,
wee uſe to ſay, now it is going away, not

If thou be <hi>broken</hi> in heart, then thy pride,
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:38284:126"/>
thy earthlineſſe, thy ſelfe-love, thy dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to good duties, and all thy ſins go
thick from thee. It may be thou haſt ſome
poares in thy heart, and thy ſins fall away
from thee in the rhume, but if they goe
not away from thee in thick fleame, the
cold of thy frozen heart is not yet broken.

ſtood (ſayes the text) <hi>and ſaid unto
the Lord, behold half of my goods I given
unto the poor, &amp;c.</hi> Luke 19. 8. ſee how
his ſins went away; every word voids
thick fleam.</p>
               <p>Firſt, he ſtood; before he clymed and
gazed after Chriſt, but being broken in
heart, he ſtood ready preſt to doe what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Chriſt would command him. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>he ſaid unto Christ;</hi> before Chriſt might
have ſaid unto him what he would; what
cared hee? but now that he is broken in
heart, here is hardly a word that Chriſt
ſaid unto him of any ſuch matter yet he
ſaid to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Behold</hi> before his behold
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:38284:127"/>
was carnall, hee did what he did to be ſeen
of men, if ever he gave ought, he loved
that men ſhould behold, but now all his
care was that Chriſt would behold
it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>I give.</hi> Before hee thought,
I <hi>will</hi> give was enough, I will give when
I dy, I will build hoſpitals when I am
dead; but now that he is <hi>broken</hi> in heart
he gives it <hi>forth-with.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>the halfe of my goods;</hi> before he
counted a penny or a farthing to a poore
body, a great matter, a great dole, if given
<hi>now</hi> and <hi>then;</hi> but now that he is broken
in heart, the <hi>halfe</hi> and not only of the <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluitie,</hi>
but alſo of <hi>Eſaus</hi> very <hi>ſubſtance</hi>
and goods, as it is in the originall, I give
to the poor, not as men commonly doe,
light come, light goe; it may be they feaſt
their rich neighbours, but hee gives
halfe his ſubſtance to the poor Saints of
God.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, <hi>And if I have taken any thing
wrongfully,</hi> though it were not much;
<hi>If I</hi> have taken <hi>any thing,</hi> though not from
the rich and great ones, but from <hi>any,</hi> rich
or poore, young or old, ſtranger or not
ſtranger, no matter <hi>who;</hi> if I have taken
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:38284:127"/>
any thing from <hi>any</hi> man by <hi>falſe accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
not only againſt Law where the Law
binds me to reſtitution, but if I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
any thing by <hi>forged cavillation,</hi>
though the Law will boulſter me out, yet
I reſtore him; he did not ſay, <hi>I give him,</hi>
as many will do, calling that which ſhould
properly be called reſtitution for wrong,
a <hi>gift</hi> I give, ſay they; he ſayes not ſo;
but he caſteth off the thought of a gift,
and doth what he doth by way of <hi>reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventhly, <hi>If I have taken any thing;</hi>
before he could ſwallow down the known
wrongs that he did; but now that he is
<hi>broken</hi> in heart, he makes a mends for the
wrongs which <hi>peradventure</hi> he did not,
to be ſure, If I have taken, <hi>I</hi> reſtore, his
reſtitution goes <hi>abſolute;</hi> although his
wrongs goe upon <hi>ifs,</hi> I <hi>reſtore</hi> him ſaies he;
and that not nigardly or ſcantly, or no
more the needs muſt, but <hi>four-fold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Thus
he reaſons; now he is <hi>broken</hi> in heart; his
ſins go <hi>thick</hi> away from him.</p>
               <p>The text but even now called him <hi>little
Zacheus,</hi> before he had ſeen Chriſt; <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rito
adhuc puſillus quia nondum viderat
Chriſtum.</hi> Iuſtly might he be ſaid to be
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:38284:128"/>
                  <hi>little Zacheus,</hi> becauſe then he had not ſeen
Chriſt; but as ſoon as ever hee had ſeen
Chriſt whom he had wronged by theſe
wrongs; as ſoon as ever he was broken in
heart, he became a great repenter, his ſins
ran thick away from him. As ſoon as the
boyle is broken out comes the matter; As
ſoon as the vein is broken, out comes the
blood; true it is adrop of blood may come
though the veine be not broken; if the
finger be but rac'd a few drops may come,
but if the veine be once <hi>broken,</hi> out comes
the blood thick and threeſold; If thou
doſt but prop off thy ſins now and then,
thy hear was never <hi>broken;</hi> for if thou
waſt once <hi>broken</hi> in heart, thy reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
would come <hi>apace,</hi> thy repentance
and thy amendement would come thick
and threefold; but if we preach and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort,
and yet ſee but thin reformation in
thee, as a ſight or ſo, thou was never yet
<hi>broken</hi> in heart: if thy heart be yet full of
thy <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> full of thy pride, luſts, &amp;c.
if thy affections bee yet full of earthly
deſires, worldly delights, vaine hopes,
carnall feares; if thy backe be yet full of
thy gariſh and humerous apparell, thy
heart is not yet <hi>broken;</hi> why? becauſe
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:38284:128"/>
the filthy matter runs not out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zacheus</hi> when he was <hi>broken</hi> in heart, his
<hi>corruptions ran out apace;</hi> both his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readineſſe
to good duties, and his dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and dulneſſe to holy duties: Chriſt
need not ſay much unto him; for he ſaid
unto Chriſt; his deſire of the credit of
the world ran out, for he gave the halfe of
his goods to the poore; his backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
and delaying ran out; for he made
preſent diſpatch, <hi>I</hi> give, his very ſecret
and unknowen iniquities ran out, <hi>if I have
taken,</hi> &amp;c. All his ſins ran thick away
from him. why? becauſe <hi>a broken heart
can hold no ſin;</hi> this is the firſt ſigne of a
broken heart <hi>from ſin;</hi> if it be broken from
its ſinfull courſe.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is, <hi>if it be broken from its
wildneſſe;</hi> the Hauk is then broken when
it is made fit for the Lurk, and the colt
is <hi>broken</hi> when made fit for the ſaddle; if
he be not <hi>broken,</hi> he will not be willing
the rider ſhall come on his back; man is
borne like a wild Aſſe colt, <hi>Job.</hi> 11. 12.
ſo thou waſt borne, and ſo thou haſt been,
and art thou not as yet broken from it?
if thou be broken in heart, then thy heart
is tame to every commandment, to every
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:38284:129"/>
truth, and thy affections are tame to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
precept. It is <hi>Calvins</hi> ſimilitude,
thou art not yet (ſaith hee) fit for Gods
ſaddle, if thou let the Devill, the world,

                  <hi>bridled</hi> from thy luſts; alas ſo thou
maieſt be, yet be wild for all that. Bee not

               <p>Doſt thou not deſpiſe to be curbed by
the word, to be bitted by reproof, wouldſt

                  </gap> rider. Thou canſt not be croſt a little
but preſently thou art wild with choller
and anger; thy fleſh and blood cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
it, and doſt thou yet ſay that thou art
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:38284:129"/>
                  <hi>broken in heart?</hi> no, no; thou waſt born
a wild Aſſe Colt, and ſo thou art ſtill.
Thou wert borne a wild olive, and ſo thou
art ſtill. Thou was never yet <hi>broken</hi> in
heart, never yet broken from ſin; if thou
wert broken from thy wildneſſe, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
exhortation would tame thee; then
thou wouldſt be glad to bee reprooved,
and controuled by the word; Thou
wouldſt leap at <hi>every</hi> commandement,
were it never ſo ſtrict, But if thou count
it preciſeneſſe and too much ſtrictneſſe
to be <hi>holy</hi> amd <hi>zealous, I</hi> ſay thou art yet
but a wild colt. Oh my brethren we have
many amongſt us who are like <hi>Iſhmael,</hi>
who was a wild man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 16. many wild
men, who pray wildly, and thinke wildly,
and heare wildly; their hearts are wild gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
hearts; while the word is preaching,
they follow their own imagnations.</p>
               <p>Dareſt thou <hi>venture</hi> upon any ſin againſt
the Goſpell of Chriſt, and dareſt thou <hi>live</hi>
in it till thou art a wicked Bedlam, The
<hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> brings all ſuch in as if they were
mad Bedlams, ſaying; <hi>why doe the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
ſo furiouſly rage, &amp;c.</hi> Chriſt would
have bound them, but they forſooth were
too wild; they would not be bound; but
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:38284:130"/>
ſay they let us break his bonds, and fling
off his cords: they will not bee bound to
ſuch ſtrictneſſe dareſt thou ſweare and lie
and covet, and be drunk, &amp;c? alas man
man thou art in a mad vaine. Dareſt thou
break the ſabbath; live in thy luſts, &amp;c.
a fury hath taken thee, thou art a mad man;
God muſt <hi>breake</hi> that wild heart of thine,
elſe thou canſt not be tamed, it may be thou
art <hi>bridled</hi> from ſin; but doſt thou bridle
thy ſelf; if not, thou art wild for all the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling
thou haſt: you never ſaw a horſe
bridle himſelf; no, no; it is wilde, peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
thou doſt bridle they ſelfe when thou
art <hi>not much</hi> tempted; but if thou beeſt
<hi>broken</hi> in heart, thou wilt refraine all
provocations whatſoever. <hi>I will keep my
mouth, &amp;c.</hi> Pſal. 39. 1. while the Devill
was before him, as <hi>Hierom</hi> expounds it,
or while <hi>Shimei</hi> was before him to tempt
him with wicked reproaches and diſgrace
full ſpeeches, as <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Theodoret</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poound
it, then would <hi>David</hi> keep his
tongue as with a bridle when he was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tempted to ſin. Here then is all the
triall; canſt thou bridle thy ſelfe from
ſin when thou art tempted to ſin? if
thou bee <hi>broken</hi> in heart, thou canſt; but
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:38284:130"/>
if thou canſt not, thou art wild unto this
day. The wild beaſts are tame enough till
a prey comes before them, and ſo thou
maiſt be tame when temptations are <hi>down;</hi>
but art thou tame when a temptation is
before thee. This is a ſecond ſigne of
brokenneſſe of heart if thou bee broken
from thy wildneſſe.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>if thou bee broken in heart, then
thou art broken from thy pride, and thou wilt
ſtoop to Gods word in all things.</hi> A broken
heart is an humble heart, I dwell with
him ſaith God <hi>Eſay.</hi> 37. 15. pride is the
<hi>root</hi> of all ſin; what is the reaſon that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
dare ſin, but becauſe they think bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of themſelves in their ſins then they do
deſerve? for did a man but thinke he were
accurſed and a damned wretch in ſinning
againſt God, be durſt never ſin, or did a
man feele that <hi>every</hi> ſin makes a man <hi>fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>;
yea more filthy then a toad; did a
man feele his owne damned condition, he
durſt not <hi>live</hi> in ſin? a man thinkes bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of himſelfe then hee deſerves whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he ſins againſt God. <hi>Heare and give
care and be not proud, for the Lord hath ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
it,</hi> Jer. 13. 15. If the Lord <hi>ſpeake,</hi>
and thou doe not <hi>heare</hi> and <hi>obey,</hi> thou art
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:38284:131"/>
proud, Oh but I am not proud, then thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt
thou, for I will heare the pooreſt bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in the ſtreet when they ſpeake to me;
yea and I will and do give the wall to my
betters, wilt thou ſo? wilt thou give man
the wall and take the wall of God? is not
this pride? <hi>ſweare not</hi> ſayes God; yet
thou wilt take the wall of that commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſweareſt. <hi>Let not the Sun go
downe upon thy wrath ſayes</hi> God; thou ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt
the wall of that commandement too;
and canſt remember an ill turn, a moneth
after, ſo, &amp;c. This is execrable and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
pride. Thou ſeekeſt after thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
and pleaſures more then after the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of God. I cannot live elſe, ſayes one;
I cannot be merry elſe, ſayes another; and
I muſt tell a lie now and then, and muſt
ſuffer bouſing and ſwearing in my houſe,
or elſe I cannot live. Thou proud wretch,
what muſt thy mirth and thy credit perke
above the commandement of Chriſt?
The wicked through the pride of his
countenance will not ſeeke after God,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 4. It is wicked pride indeed
when thou ſeekeſt thy ſelfe more then
God. I tell thee the word hath not bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
the heart untill it hath broken the neck
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:38284:131"/>
of this pride of thine; never tell me that
thou art not proud in thy apparell; if a
ſervant goe never ſo meanly in apparell,
yet he is proud if he obey not all his
Maſters <hi>lawfull</hi> and <hi>good</hi> commandments,
never tell me thou boweſt to God or thou
kneeleſt in prayer to God; cluck &amp; crouch,
bow and bend thou never ſo much, yet
thou art proud, if every corruption of
thine will not yeild to <hi>every</hi> commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of God; thou art not broken in
heart; for if thou wert broken in heart
thou wouldſt ſtoop to <hi>all</hi> Gods comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements.
Doſt thou mock at preaching,
&amp;c. tuſh, thou wilt not be ſo preciſe, If
ever thou be one of <hi>his,</hi> thou wilt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obey him, but alſo be circumſpect in
<hi>all</hi> thy obedience; nay if thou be <hi>broken</hi>
in heart, thou wilt not only ſtoope to
every commandement of God, but alſo
count it thine honour and glory, though
it be the meaneſt office in his ſervice.
<hi>Thou art my glory</hi> ſayes <hi>David, David</hi> that
was broken from his pride, counted it his
glory to obey God, his glory to ſerve God,
yea his glory to be reproached for his
ſake, Thou art not <hi>broken</hi> in heart till
thou count it thine <hi>excellency</hi> to ſerve
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:38284:132"/>
We uſe to ſay ſuch a ones excellency is in
his learning or wit, &amp;c. but he is too <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe</hi>
and too <hi>holy</hi> as if it were not a mans
excellency to be pure and zealous, and to
ſerve God: But I tell thee if thou count
it not thine <hi>honor</hi> to be forward for God,
and to be nicknamed for Chriſt, thine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
to lie in this that thou art godly
and heavenly, thon art a proud fool; when
<hi>John Huſſe</hi> was to write upon the Epiſtle
of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> he counted it ſuch an high
office of dignity that he was confounded
at his owne indignity, ſaying unto God,
<hi>Hei mihi laudare to contremiſco;</hi> he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it ſuch an honour to doe any thing for
God that he was aſhamed at his owne
vildneſſe. O my brethren God is called the
<hi>excellency</hi> of <hi>Jacob;</hi> it was not their <hi>valour</hi>
nor <hi>wiſedome,</hi> but <hi>this</hi> was their excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
that <hi>God was their God;</hi> thy riches
are proud riches if thy excellency lie in
them more then in God; if thou doſt not
go about <hi>every</hi> commandement as thine
<hi>excellency,</hi> thy obedience is proud. This
is a third ſigne of a heart brokeu from ſin if
it be broken from its pride.</p>

               <p>This verſe is a complaint of the Prophet

               <p>By <hi>righteous</hi> is here meant not ſuch as

Thirdly, becauſe, <hi>all have ſinned,</hi>
even the moſt righteous man; now the
<hi>wages</hi> of ſin is death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 23. the
moſt righteous man muſt dye.</p>
               <p>Fourthly becauſe, <hi>as death came into the
world by ſin,</hi> Rom. 5. 12. <hi>ſo ſin muſt
goe out of the world by death;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is needful that the righteous die,
that ſo they may be freed from <hi>ſin.</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> I anſwer he hath aboliſhed death; as he
hath aboliſhed ſin; now he hath not taken
ſin quite away from us, for we ſee it doth
ſtill remain in us; neither hath he quite
aboliſhed death from the righteous, for
we ſee they all <hi>dye;</hi> but hee aboliſhed the
<hi>dominion</hi> of ſin, ſo that it doth no longer
<hi>raign</hi> in us; and ſo hee hath taken away
the <hi>dominion</hi> of death, ſo that it doth not
rage as a Tyrant over us, ſo that it is not
hurtfull unto us as a puniſhment, but as a
means to convey us into a better life.
Chriſt hath taken away the <hi>ſting</hi> both of
ſin and death; though not the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
away from us; yet he will one day
free us from them both; ſo then the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:38284:135"/>
muſt ſuffer death as well as the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
though not in the ſame kind.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Let no man then look to be exempted from
death for his righteouſneſſe, nor from any
outward miſeries that may befall the ſons of
Adam;</hi> nay if we are the ſervants of Chriſt,
we muſt look for a greater ſhare in theſe
then other men; greater croſſes, greater
afflictions, greater ſickneſſe and harder
pangs of death do oft befall the righteous,
as it did unto this our brother, who
though he were old and ſtricken in yeers,
yet the pangs of death were ſtrong upon
him. Thoſe whom God will make heires
of <hi>Eternall</hi> life, he ſuffers them to have a
<hi>greater</hi> portion in theſe afflictions. But the
wicked are fat and full, and die with their
bones full of marrow, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeakes; they
commonly have little ſickneſſe and an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie
death: but the godly do ordinarily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe
greater pangs; let none therefore
think that for his righteouſneſſe he ſhall be
free.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>conſider we here how few a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us have learned this Arithmetique,
namely to number our dayes,</hi> and they are
but ſhort, even a ſpan long; who is there
almoſt that thinkes on death? who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:38284:136"/>
himſelfe for it? and yet all, even the
moſt <hi>righteous</hi> muſt die; for God hath pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
that fiery blade of death at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
into the Paradiſe of heaven, ſo that
none can enter before they taſte of death,
and all muſt taſte of it, yea the moſt right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous
are not exempted from the ſtroak of
death. This then ſhould teach us to labour
to draw our hearts from the love of this
preſent life; and what can better perſwade
us and wean us from the love of this
world, then a due conſideration of
death? wee know we muſt all <hi>die,</hi> and
therefore we ſhould prepare our ſelves for
it. If any prophane perſon amongſt us
knew that this night muſt be his laſt night,
and that now hee had no longer to live,
would not this amaze him and make him
bethink himſelfe and to prepare for death?
If rich coveteous men which ſpend the
whole courſe of their life in providing for
the things of this life, did truely conſider
of death, and that their end draweth nigh,
would they doe as they do, when this life
and all the things of this life, and all our
joyes and pleasures of this world ſhall
ſhortly have an end? for when death
comes, they ſhall all be taken from us, or
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:38284:136"/>
rather we from them. Oh how excellent
a thing is it then for us to be drawne from
the things of this life unto a due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of death, and of thoſe heavenly Ioyes
and happineſſe to come! Oh you that
look for theſe things, what manner of men
ought you to be in <hi>holy</hi> life and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ſeeing wee all muſt die, and
this preſent life muſt come to an end, this
ſhould teach us to prepare our ſelves for a
better life; to provide for a ſurer building,
a better eſtate which ſhall never periſh.
Philoſophers who were but heathen men,
could meditate on <hi>death,</hi> ſetting it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
before their eyes. But this is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for us that are <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
truly prepare our ſelves for it unleſſe
we firſt build a ſurer foundation in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
for a better life, which ſhall never
have an end; and this no Heathen or wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man can ever do. Oh how wofull
would that meſſage be unto a wicked man,
that was brought unto good King <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi>
Comes, ſet thy houſe in order, for thou
muſt die, and not live; and why ſhould it
be terribl unto him? ſurely becauſe he hath
no hope of a better life, he hath not provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:38284:137"/>
for a better habitation. Conſider then
with what comfort thou couldſt entertain
this meſſage; with what comfort canſt thou
meet with death? for he is no Chriſtan that
ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not in ſome meaſure willingly meet with
death, for by it we paſſe unto a better life:
for as this our brother ſpake often, hee
that would have comfort in death, muſt
look beyond death; he muſt not fix his
eyes on the <hi>terrors</hi> of death, but he muſt
look beyond to that glorious <hi>inheritance</hi>
to which wee are paſſing through death,
and there ſhall he behold his Saviour put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth his hand ready to receive him;
there ſhall he ſee the bleſſed Saints and
Angels whoſe company he ſhall enjoy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
an infinite heap of Ioyes and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe
that is prepared for him alſo. O my
beloved, nothing will make us willingly to
entertaine the meſſage of death, but only
the comforts of the life to come. Oh let
us labour then for theſe comforts that ſo
we may be provided againſt death; were
it not a fooliſhneſſe for a man who being
a tennant at will, and ſhortly to be turned
out of his houſe, never to take care for ano<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
until he is caſt out of doors? Beloved
we are all tennants at will and we are
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:38284:137"/>
very ſhortly to be caſt out of our dwelling
houſes of clay, and ſhall we not provide
for a ſurer habitation? Death is at hand,
and our life muſt ſhortly have an end; let
us therefore labour to be aſſured of a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
life, when this is ended, that ſo with
comfort we may meet with death.</p>
               <p>Now we come unto the ſecond point
which is here to be conſidered; taken from
the complaint of the Prophet that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
did not conſider nor lay it to heart. <hi>viz</hi>
the death of the righteous, whence I note,
that <hi>The death loſſe of good men muſt be laid
to heart as a ſpecial cauſe of grief and ſorrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We ought juſtly to be grieved at the
death of a <hi>righteous</hi> man, when God ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
him from amongſt us. How did the
Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> and the people lament the
death of that good King <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 Chron.
35. 23. ſo devout men made great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
for the death of <hi>Stephen,</hi> Act. 8.
2. ſo all <hi>Iſrael</hi> lamented the death of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi>
Deur. 34. 8. And <hi>Joaſh</hi> the King of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> weept for the death of the Prophet
<hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 Kings 13. 14. and thus wee
ſhould lament and ſorrow for the death
of any righteous man, yet not in reſpect of
themſelves, as if their caſe were worſe
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:38284:138"/>
now then before, for they are now more
happy.</p>
               <p>But first, <hi>in regard of Gods glory</hi> whereof
they were inſtruments to ſet it forth; for
ſince they were taken away, Gods glory is
impaired; becauſe there are the fewer left
which doe truly ſerve and worſhip him;
for as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>the dead praiſe not the
Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 115. 17. ſo then they being
dead, do not praiſe the Lord among
the faithfull on earth any longer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>in regard of the great loſſe that
others have by their death,</hi> who have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
received much good by them in
their life; for the godly doe ſo order
and behave themſelves in all their wayes
that they doe good whereſoever they
come; therefore when they die, it muſt
needs be a great loſſe unto ſuch who
might if they had lived, been bettered
by them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>we ought to lament the death of
the righteous in regard of the evill to come;</hi>
for while they live, they are as a wall about
us to keep Gods judgements from us; if
there had been but <hi>ten</hi> righteous men in
<hi>Sodome,</hi> it had not been deſtroyed <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.
32. If there be a meſſenger one among a
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:38284:138"/>
thouſand, ſaith <hi>Elihu,</hi> to ſhew unto man his
uprightnes, then is God gracious unto him
<hi>Job</hi> 33. 23. Run ye to and fro in the ſtreets
of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſaith God, and ſee if you can
find a man, if there be any that executeth
judgement, and ſeeks the Lord, and I will
pardon it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 1. ſo that if there had been
but one <hi>righteous</hi> man among the people
in that city, the Lord would have ſpared
them even for that ones ſake; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord ſpeaking of the righteous,
ſaith, I will faſten him as a naile in a ſure
place, he ſhall be as a glorious throne unto
his fathers houſe. <hi>Eſay.</hi> 22. 23. Oh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
then what a loſſe we have when the
<hi>righteous</hi> dye; we are like to periſh, when
the naile that was in the ſure place is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooved,
cut downe and falles; for then
the burden that was upon it, ſhall be cut
off, <hi>Eſay,</hi> 22. 25. You therefore of this
Congregation, conſider, and lament for
this your loſſe, in that this <hi>good</hi> man is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from among you; for who knowes
whether God ſpared this congregation e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for this good mans ſake? for it is the
righteous only that God reſpects, and for
their ſakes he will ſpare a whole people;
therefore ſurely as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:38284:139"/>
righteous is better then his neighbour,
yea though never ſo poore and deſpiſed
in the eyes of the world, yet are they
<hi>precious</hi> in Gods account; <hi>when I make up
my Jewels</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>I will ſpare them</hi>
Mala. 3. 17. ſo that the righteous are
Gods <hi>Jewels,</hi> the excellent of the earth, are
precious in Gods ſight; and have we not
great cauſe then to lament for the loſſe of
ſuch?</p>
               <p>Seeing then it becommeth all Gods
children to lament the death of the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous;
O how farre then are all ſuch from
the ſpirit of God, who are ſo farre from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting,
that on the contrary they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
at the death of the godly man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he ſtood in their way? they could
not follow their workes of darkneſſe as
they would, but hee hindered them, he
ſtood in their light, they could not run on
in ſin and wickedneſſe, but he would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving,
admoniſhing, and telling them
of their faults, and this makes them long
for the good mans end, and to rejoyce in it
when it doth come; theſe doe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that when the righteous is taken
from the earth, then they lie open unto
the judgemens of God; But as the Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:38284:139"/>
thruſt out juſt <hi>Lot</hi> out of their city,
that ſo Gods vengeance might fall the
ſooner upon them; for till he was gone,
the Lord would not deſtroy them <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.
21. Even ſo doe theſe men deſire to bee
rid of the righteous, and rejoyce when
they are taken from them, not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that they are open to Gods ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
which hangeth over their heads
ready to devoure them.</p>
               <p>We ought then to be moſt grieved for
the death of the righteous, when any of
the Saints are taken away by death; Oh
what a comfort is a righteous man to the
children of God? what a feeling of grace
is there in ſuch a one? what comfortable
words come there from the mouth of ſuch
men? how full of comfortable ſpeeches
was this poore man alwayes miniſtring
comfort to thoſe that came to viſit him?
what a loſſe is this then unto us? it is more
then if thouſands of the wicked had gone
together; and ſhall wee not mourne for
the loſſe of ſuch a one? If one of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
or friends dye, wee can mourne for
them; and good reaſon; and ſhall wee
not mourne for the loſſe of one of Gods
Saints, one of the ſpirituall family, one
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:38284:140"/>
of our fellow members.</p>
               <p>In this then examine thy ſelfe how it is
with thee; when thou heareſt of any of the
faithfull that are taken away, art thou
greived for it, doſt thou lament and mourn
for it? if thou doeſt not, ſurely thou
art no true Chriſtian; for the children of
God cannot chooſe but lay it to heart and
lament, when any of the righteous is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from among them. As <hi>Iſrael</hi> lamented
the death of <hi>Samuel. 1 Sam.</hi> 25. 1.</p>
               <p>Now concerning the ſin of the people
in not regarding nor laying it to heart,
this was a great ſin of <hi>ſecurity</hi> in them, in
that they did as it were reſt on their pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
and cryed peace unto themſelves,
notwithſtanding Gods judgements upon
them, in taking away the righteous, and
freeing them from the evill to come, wee
note that,</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>
                  </label>
                  <hi>When God will bring any great judgement</hi>
upon <hi>a People or Nation, he will ordinarily
take away his faithfull ſervants from among
them, that ſo they may be freed from the evill
to come.</hi> Thus good <hi>Joſiah</hi> muſt periſh in
his young yeares, that ſo he might not
be taken with the evill to come; I will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thee unto thy fathers faith God, and
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:38284:140"/>
thou ſhalt goe to thy grave in peace, and
thy eyes ſhall not ſee all the evill that I will
bring upon this place. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 22. 20. So
when God told <hi>Abraham</hi> of the bondage
and captivity whereunto he would bring
his poſterity, he ſaith <hi>thou ſhalt go to thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in peace</hi> Gen. 15. 13. And thus it
was with the ancient Father Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine;</hi>
when the cruell <hi>Vandals</hi> beſieged his
city, he prayed that the Lord would either
take him away, or cauſe them to leave the
ſiege; and the Lord heard him, and tooke
him away, and preſently after the <hi>Vandals</hi>
deſtroyed the city. So <hi>Luther</hi> writing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this text, ſaith that the Lord after his
death would bring great affliction upon
<hi>Germany,</hi> and two yeares after it ſo fell
out indeed. Thus ordinarily God takes
away his ſervants from the evill to
come.</p>
               <p>See here the mercy of God unto his
children in that hee takes them away from
among the wicked, he calls them out of
this world that they may not pertake of
the evill to come; ſhall any one then think
it a curſe to be taken away betimes, in
his young yeares? nay happy is hee that
is taken away from theſe miſerable and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:38284:141"/>
fearfull times wherein the judgement of
God, for our ſins hangeth over our heads;
and is ready every day to ſeize upon
us.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſeeing that God when he
meanes to bring any heavy judgement
upon a people, doth <hi>ordinarily</hi> take away
the righteous from the evill to come, this
ſhewes that when the righteous are taken
from amongſt us, wee are certainly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
ſome judgement of God upon us.
For theſe are they which ſtood in the <hi>gap</hi>
and kept off the fire of Gods wrath from
us, that it ſhould not conſume us: but now
being gone, wee lie open to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God; and therefore when any
righteous men are taken from us, the loſſe
of them ought to drive us to repentance,
leaſt Gods judgements come presently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us and conſume us, therefore we muſt
forſake our ſins and evill wayes, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
new obedience unto God, ſo will
he be mercifull unto us, yea he will bee a
ſhield of defence unto us, and a wall of fire
about us, and hee will turne away his
judgements from us.</p>
               <p>Beloved in the Lord wee are here aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:38284:141"/>
to perform this laſt Chriſtian duty
of burial to the Saint of God now deceaſed,
whoſe ſoule I am as certainly perſwaded
is at reſt with Chriſt in glory, as I am ſure
his body is in this coffin. When I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
thoſe excellent graces that were in
him, his great <hi>knowledge</hi> in the word of
God, his <hi>love, zeale, patience and humility;</hi>
when I conſider his excellent <hi>gifts</hi> in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting,
exhorting, admoniſhing, with his
heavenly gift of prayer, &amp;c. and withall
conſider that he was unlettered, hee
could neither write nor read, I cannot but
call to mind that in the <hi>Acts.</hi> 4. 13.
where it is ſaid of the Prieſt and Phariſees
that they ſeeing the boldneſſe of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
how they anſwered and ſpake, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
them to be unlearned and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
men, they knew that they had been
with Ieſus: Even ſo may we know that this
our brother had been with Ieſus: not in
the fleſh, but in the ſpirit, and that from
him he received theſe things, that <hi>book-learning</hi>
could never have taught him; for
he was a good man and full of the holy
Ghoſt, as it is laid of <hi>Barnabas;</hi> Truly
verifying that of the Apoſtle that God
hath choſen the poore of this world, that
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:38284:142"/>
they ſhould be rich in faith; he was a
true follower of Chriſt, of whom it is
ſaid hee went about doing good; ſo this
Diſciple of Chriſt did good whereſoever
he came; how many by him have been
ſtirred up, comforted and admoniſhed
and quickened unto good duties, feeding
them with the lips of knowledge who fed
him with bodily food? how often have
I my ſelf through him been ſtirred up to
good duties? how often have I been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed
and comforted in my heavineſſe by
this poore man! ſo lively did he beare the
Image, of God in him, that me thought
Chriſt Jeſus walked in him alive upon the
earth; how much true ſervice; ſincere o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
fervent and faithfull prayer had
the Lord out of that poore cottage wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he lived? If ever there were a true child
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and an heire to the promiſe,
this was hee; if ever there were among us
a true <hi>Israelite</hi> in whom there was no guil,
this was hee; If ever there were amongſt
us a true Chriſtian that ſhined as a light to
thoſe amongſt whom he lived, this was
hee; If ever there were amongſt us a poor
man rich in faith, this was hee. In his life
he was a patterne to all that knew him, ſo
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:38284:142"/>
contented with his eſtate, ſo diligent in
the duties of his calling whilſt health ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered;
In ſickneſſe untill death whilſt
ſpeech continued, ſo comfortable that I
never came to him, but I went away bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
by him. O how did hee exhort and
ſtirre up all thoſe that came to viſit him, to
hold out conſtantly unto the end, to
grow and increaſe in thoſe good begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
which they had made? how often
and how excellently would he ſpeake of
the benefits which wee have by Chriſt,
even the pardon of ſin, more like a Divine
then a common Ghriſtian, and ſo feeling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
did hee expreſſe the certaine pardon of
his owne ſin, even the ſweete aſſurance
thereof, that it did my heart good to hear
him. Often did he deplore the ſtate of
theſe evill times, in which we live, from
which the Lord hath now taken him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;
Often did hee with tears bewaile
the ſtate of this congregation, and their
unfruitfulneſſe under the miniſtry of the
word. How did hee even with teares pray
for his enemies? he had ſome enimies, but
they were ſuch as his piety, religion and
care to keep a good conſcience made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimies
unto him, touching whom I muſt
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:38284:143"/>
ſay that which without trembling I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſpeak, that as they refuſed his ſociety
while he lived, and ſought to thruſt him
from among them, ſo I feare that where
he now is, they ſhall never come except
they repent. O it is a fearfull thing to hate
a man for his religion and piety; but ſuch
was his love and compaſſion towards
them, that he did often with teares la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
their eſtate and pray for them. At
the mention of death he would ſtill repeat
the point not long ſince delivered; that <hi>he
that would have comfort in death, muſt goe
beyond death;</hi> even to that glorious inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
to the which we are paſſing
through death? and never in my life did I
ever ſee any man ſo comfortably and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly
adreſſe himſelf to encounter with
death as he did. O ſaid he, this is the time
that I have long waited for; and as the
pangs of death grew neerer, ſo uſed he the
more comfortable ſpeeches, ſaying with
<hi>Paul,</hi> I deſire to be diſſolved and to be with
Chriſt; now ſhall I ſee my ſweet Saviour
whom I have longed for; and when death
was even upon him, he ſaid come Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
come quickly, and ſo with admirable
patience endured the pangs of death after
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:38284:143"/>
prayer with him when his ſpeech began
to faile, I exhorted him now to look up to
his Redeemer, who was ready to receive
him into his Maſters joy; and I ſpake
ſomething out of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the happy eſtate of thoſe that die in
the Lord, adding further that all this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
we have by Chriſt, He anſwered
with theſe his laſt words which with
much difficulty he ſpake; ſaying, bleſſed
be his glorious name, bleſſed be his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
name, and thus this faithfull ſervant of
Chriſt and heire of bleſſing, gave up his
breath in bleſſing God and died, praiſing
that God to whoſe praiſe he had lived.
And what ſhould I ſay more but as <hi>David</hi>
ſaid of <hi>Abner,</hi> died <hi>Abner</hi> as a fool dieth?
died this our brother as a fool, as a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
as a wicked man dieth, of whom no
reckoning is to be made? no, precious is
his death in the eyes of the Lord, and in
the eyes of all that fear the Lord, and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſhall his memory be, yea all that knew
him well, will call him bleſſed. And for
my own part ſo often as I ſhall think of his
death, and often I muſt think thereon, my
ſoul ſhall wiſh and pray, Oh let medie the
death of the righteous, and let my laſt end
be like unto his <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <epigraph>
                  <bibl>JER. 14. 9.</bibl>
                  <q>And we are called by thy Name; leave
us not.</q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Wo things (Brethren and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
in Chriſt Jeſus) are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
and expreſſed by the
holy Prophet from the firſt
verſe to the 13. verſe.</p>
               <p>There is firſt a <hi>denomination of a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and that is dearth or famine from
the firſt verſe to the ſeventh.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:38284:146"/>
Secondly, the ſword is threatned to the
thirteenth verſe; he will ſend the famine,
then the ſword, and he will not bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated.</p>
               <p>Then in the eighth and ninth verſes we
<hi>have the importunate prayer of the Church to
turne away theſe judgements:</hi> And the
prayer is marvellous ſweet, in confeſſion,
where they confeſſe their ſins, and ſeek to
God for ſuccour.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they deſire God that he would
not take his providence from them, <hi>why,
ſtayeſt thou but for a night?</hi> verſe the 8, as
if they ſhould have ſaid, it is marveilous
ſtrange, that thou behaveſt thy ſelf ſo like
a <hi>ſtranger;</hi> thou ſeeſt our ſorrowes, and
doſt not help us; thou perceiveſt our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and thou regardeſt us not; It is
ſtrange, it is ſtrange; that the God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael
ſtands as a man aſtoniſhed; that thou
that haſt heretofore received us, ſhouldſt
now ſtand as a man amazed and aſtoniſhed,
as if thou wert weary of this thy work, and
couldſt do no more, as if thou ſhouldſt ſay
<hi>Ieruſalem</hi> cannot be ſaved, and <hi>Judah</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſuccoured.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they deſire that God would
not take away his preſence from them;
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:38284:146"/>
                  <hi>leave us not to our ſelves</hi> ſay they; <hi>let us ſee
thy face;</hi> though we die, yet let it be in thy
preſence; yea though thou help us not,
yet it doth us good to look upon our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
and thou canſt help us; and thus
you ſee the arguments wherewith they
<hi>preſſe</hi> the Lord how, ſweet they are,
<hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>thou art the hope of</hi> Iſrael; Alas if
thou forſake us we are all loſt; our hope
is not in the meanes only; but our hope
is in <hi>thee,</hi> leav us not, for thou art the hope
of Iſrael, it is the taſk that thou haſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
upon thee, leave us not therefore.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>thou haſt made thy ſelfe a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi>
and now is the time of trouble, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now performe what thou haſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>thou art in the midſt of us,</hi> that
is, thou art a great Commander amongſt
us, alwayes ready to ſuccour us; and wilt
thou now ſee us periſh? thou art more
neer to us then the Ark in the middeſt of
the Campe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 6. As if they ſhould
ſay he lives in the midſt ofus, and will hee
not ſave us?</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>we are called by thy name, and</hi>
therefore wee have intereſt in thee, to
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:38284:147"/>
whom ſhould wives go, but to their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands?
to whom ſhould children go, but
to their fathers? to whom ſhould ſervants
go, but to their Maſters? to whom then
ſhould we go, but to thee our God and
Saviour? leave us not therefore and
wee will meddle with none but thee.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>though God might leave them,
yet they beg that he would not;</hi> that is, the
A <hi>men</hi> to their prayers; though thou
ſtand and wilt not help us; yet let us die
in thy preſence; and this is the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
of the Saints, they deſire not to be
<hi>left</hi> of God, although God might leave
them; whence learne that God might caſt
off a people.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iſrael</hi> did feare it, and it is that which
they prayed againſt, God might leav them:
I doe not ſay that God <hi>will</hi> caſt off his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
ones eternally, but thoſe in outward
covenant. ſee <hi>Eſay 1. verſe</hi> 2. &amp;c. <hi>Heare
O Heavens, Hearken O Earth, I have nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
and brought up children, but they have
rebelled againſt mee; The Oxe knoweth his
Owner, and the Aſſe his Maſters Crib, but</hi>
Iſrael <hi>hath not knowen, my People have not
underſtood,</hi> &amp;c. and verſe the ſeventh;
ſee the judgement; <hi>your cities are burnt
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:38284:147"/>
with fire; ſtrangers devoure your land in your
preſence, and it is deſolate like the overthrow
of ſtrangers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is an <hi>outward</hi> Calling, as well as
an <hi>effectuall</hi> Calling; God may <hi>reject; for
many are called, but few choſen</hi> ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.
My brethren caſt your thoughts
afarre off, and ſee what is become of thoſe
famous Churches of <hi>Pergamus</hi> and <hi>Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tira</hi>
and the reſt mentioned <hi>Rev. 1. verſe</hi> 11.
And who would have thought that <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>
ſhould have been made an heap of
ſtones and a vagabond people? and yet we
ſee God hath forſaken them, ſhewing us
thereby that although God will never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
his own elect ones; yet hee may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
ſuch as are in outward covenant with
him.</p>
               <p>The Lord is ſaid to diſ-church or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
a people <hi>Hoſea.</hi> 1. 9. there God
ſaith call his name <hi>Loammi</hi> for yee are not
my people, and therefore I will not bee
your God. And as I may ſo ſay, he ſues
out a bill of divorcement; as it was in
the old Law, they that had any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
their wives, they ſued out a bill of
<hi>divorcement</hi> againſt them, and ſo doth
God, ſee <hi>Hoſea.</hi> 2. 2. Plead with thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:38284:148"/>
tell her ſhee is not my Spouſe nor
my beloved; but let her caſt away her
fornications out of her ſight, and her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulteries
from between her breaſts, leſt I
make her as at the firſt, that is, as ſhee
was in Egypt, poore and miſerable. As if
God ſhould now ſay to <hi>England,</hi> plead,
plead with <hi>England</hi> all yee that are my
Miniſters in the way of my truth, and
ſay unto her, let her caſt away her rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions,
leaſt I leave her as I found her in
the day of Captivity and bondage under
the blindneſſe of popery and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> But how doth God caſt off a
people?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer, firſt when he takes away
his <hi>love</hi> and reſpect from a people; and
as his love, ſo the <hi>token</hi> of his love, which
is his Word and Sacraments, the meanes of
ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Secondly, when he takes away his <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi>
I meane when he takes downe
his <hi>walls,</hi> that is, his <hi>Magiſtracy</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, when in ſtead of <hi>Councelling</hi>
there comes in <hi>Bribing;</hi> and in ſtead of
<hi>true teaching</hi> there comes <hi>in daubing</hi> with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:38284:148"/>
morter; when God takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the hedge thereof, <hi>Eſay</hi> 5. 5. or the
ſtakes growe rotten and are not renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
then is God going away.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, when God takes away the
<hi>benefit</hi> of both theſe helps, they are ſignes
of Gods departure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vſe</hi> May God un-church or diſcharge
a People and caſt a Nation off? Oh then
let this teach us to caſt off all <hi>ſecurity;</hi> for
miſeries are nigh at hand in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility;
when wee obſerve what God hath
done for us, all things are <hi>ripe</hi> to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and yet we feare it not, but wee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to our ſelves ſafety, and conſider not
that <hi>England</hi> is ready to be harrowed,
and yet wee cannot entertaine a <hi>thought</hi>
of <hi>Englands</hi> deſolation; when there are
ſo many htopheſies in it of its deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
yet wee cannot be perſwaded of it,
but in our Iudgements it muſt not be, it
muſt not be <hi>as yet;</hi> as if it were unpoſſible
that God ſhould leave <hi>England,</hi> as if God
were a cockering Father over lewd chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
God may leave a Nation, and his
elect may ſuffer, and why may not <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?
Englands</hi> ſins are very great, and
the greater, becauſe the <hi>meanes</hi> are great,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:38284:149"/>
and our <hi>warnings</hi> are and have been great;
but yet our <hi>mercies</hi> are farre greater;
<hi>England</hi> hath been a mirrour of mercies;
yet now God may leave it, and make it
the mirrour of his juſtice. Look how God
ſpake to the people that did brag of their
temple <hi>Jer.</hi> 7. 4. ſaith God, <hi>Truſt not in
lying words, ſaying the Temple of the Lord,
this is the Temple of the Lord;</hi> but what
ſaith the Lord by the Prophet in the
twelfth and fourteenth verſes, <hi>Goe now to
my place which was in</hi> Shiloh, <hi>where I ſet my
name at the beginning, and behold what I did
unto it for the wickedneſſe of my people</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
&amp;c. Even ſo <hi>England,</hi> thou haſt the
Temple and the Prieſts; and yet may not
God that deſtroyed <hi>Shiloh,</hi> deſtroy thee?
Goe to <hi>Bohemia;</hi> and from thence to the
<hi>Palatinate,</hi> and from thence to other parts
of <hi>Germany;</hi> Doe but imagine that you
were there or doe but mark what travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
ſay. Gods Churches are made heapes
of ſtones, and thoſe <hi>Bethels</hi> wherein
Gods name was called upon, are now
defiled Temples; For Satan and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition
to raigne in, you cannot
goe three ſteps but you ſhall ſee the
head of a dead man; And goe a little
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:38284:149"/>
further, and you ſhall ſee the heart pickt
out by the fowles of the ayre, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſad ſpectacle? and then ſurely you
will say, <hi>Tylly</hi> hath been here or there;
now are theſe Churches become deſolate,
and may not <hi>England?</hi> Doe but goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Cities and Townes, and there
you may ſee many compaſſed about with
chaines of Captivity, and every man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaning
himſelf. Doe but look under a
tree, and there you may ſee a poor father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
child ſending out his breath and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto his helpleſſe Mother; ſtep but
a little further, and you ſhall ſee the help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
Wife, the ſad Wife bemoaning her
Husband, and this is her miſery, ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
die time enough, but ſhee ſhall ſee
greater miſery; for either ſhe ſhall (as ſhe
thinks) ſee her little ones daſht againſt
the ſtones, or toſſed upon the Pikes, or if
they live, that then they ſhall be brought
up in Popery, and then ſhee weeps again,
and thinks that if her Husband be dead it
is well: But it may be he is upon the rack,
or put to ſome other torment, and then
ſhe dies an hundred times before ſhe can
die; Thus if you can ſet your ſoules in
their ſoules ſtead, and imagine you were
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:38284:150"/>
in their condition, and ſay, may not this
bee the condition of <hi>England,</hi> and who
knowes but it may? O my beloved, <hi>bee
not high minded; but feare;</hi> for as we have
Gods bountie on the one ſide, ſo (for
ought I know) we may have his ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
on the other ſide, Pranck not then
your ſelves with fooliſh imaginations
ſaying, who dare come to hurt <hi>England?</hi>
the <hi>Spaniard</hi> hath his hands full, and the
<hi>French</hi> are too weak. But beloved be not
deluded; who would have thought that
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the Lady city of all Nations,
whither the tribes went up to worſhip,
ſhould become a heap of ſtones and a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabond
people? but yet you ſee it was,
and is to this day; And I pray, why may
it not be <hi>Englands</hi> caſe? Learne therfore,
heare, and feare God, for aſſuredly God
can be God without <hi>Englands</hi> proſperity;
Doe not ſay here are many good Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
doe you think that God is beholding
to you for your religion? ſurely not: For
rather then he will preſerve ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
his name, and <hi>yet</hi> hate to be <hi>reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi>
he will raiſe up of theſe ſtones chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> he will rather go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Turky and ſay unto them, Thou art my
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:38284:150"/>
people, and I will be your God.</p>
               <p>But wilt thou let God goe <hi>England?</hi>
are you ſo content, and will youlet Chriſt
goe and God goe? O no, no; lay heart
and hands upon him as they did upon
<hi>Paul;</hi> every one of you lay hold on him
and ſay thou ſhalt not goe from us, for we
are called by thy name, therefore leave
us not; And for my part I will pray
that he doth not take his leave of us.
Doe you thihke that <hi>Rome</hi> will forſake or
part with her Gods? no, they will rather
looſe their lives; and wilt thou let thy
God goe O <hi>England?</hi> plead with thy
God and let him not depart, but part
rather with thy rebellions.</p>
               <q>Wee are called by thy name, leave us not.</q>
               <p>You ſee the Church is very importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
to keep God with them, they lay
hold on God with Coards of arguments;
O thou hope of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> doe not leave us;
they beſet God with their prayers, and
as it were they watch him at the townes
end that he ſhould not goe away, and
they ſay, thou ſhalt ſtill abide with us,
they are importunate that he doe not leave
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:38284:151"/>
them, whence obſerve, <hi>Doct.</hi> That <hi>it is
the importunate deſire of the Saints of God,
ſtill to keepe God preſent with them.</hi>
They cared not ſo much for ſword or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
as they did for the loſſe of Gods
preſence; O Lord, leave us not ſay they;
this was their prayer; and blame them
not; for conſider what a grief it is that
God ſhould ſtand by and not help them,
Good Lord (ſay they) leave us not, wee
cannot abide to thinke that God ſhould
leave us, much leſſe can we endure to feele
it or taſte it; thus they did, and thus the
Saints of God ſhould doe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 14,
15. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith <hi>if thy preſence goe not with
us, carry us not hence;</hi> alas, <hi>Moſes</hi> might
have gone upon faire termes; yee ſhall
(ſaith God) poſſeſſe the land in peace
with proſperity; But what ſaith <hi>Moſes?</hi>
though wee might have <hi>Canaan</hi> and all
the delights there, yet carry us not hence
unleſſe thy <hi>preſence</hi> goe with us; this is
the ſtay and the ſtrength that he ſtickes
too. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80. 18, 19. Turne us again
O Lord of hoſts, make thy face to ſhine
upon us; here is a man, a <hi>David,</hi> a heart
worth gold, hee makes not many ſuits,
but hee comes home, he ſues to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:38284:151"/>
make thy face (ſaith hee) to ſhine
upon us; as if he ſhould have ſaid that is
proſperity enough, for it endureth for
ever.</p>
               <p>But what is the preſence of God? In a
word, it is the particular favour of God
which hee expreſſeth in his Ordinances,
it is all the good and ſweetneſſe that flowes
from the purity of Gods worſhip, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
God reveales himſelfe unto us. It is not
gold, wealth, nor proſperity, that makes
God to be our God; for there is more
gold in the Weſt <hi>Indies,</hi> then in all Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endome,
but it is Gods <hi>ordinances</hi> purely
adminiſtred that brings Gods preſence to
a people. God forſooke <hi>Shiloh</hi> becauſe
his ordinances were not purely kept
there; when the people left the Arke (<hi>viz</hi>)
hs pure worſhip, then God left the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
when the Arke of Godspreſence
was among them, the word in the purity
of it, then his face was there, and there
God was principally preſent; hence it
was that <hi>Cain</hi> is ſaid to be caſt out of Gods
preſence; becauſe he was caſt out from
the Church, hee was caſt out from Gods
ordinances; if a people doe outwardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme,
and ſincerely worſhip God they
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:38284:152"/>
may remaine; if <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> had
but <hi>legally</hi> repented, they had remained,
they had not been deſtroyed; And hence
it is that the Saints are ſo urgent for Gods
Ordinances in the <hi>purity</hi> of them: But
the wicked ſay once a Sabbath is enough,
and once a week is too much; by this we
may ſee that <hi>England;</hi> is ripe; and is ſhee
nor weary of God? nay, ſhee is fat fed to
the ſlaughter. But it was not ſo with the
Saints and people of God in former times;
it was <hi>Davids</hi> grand requeſt, that hee
might <hi>dwell</hi> in the houſe of the Lord,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. 4. And <hi>Pſalme</hi> the 42. and
the firſt verſe hee ſaid, his ſoule did <hi>pant</hi>
for Gods ordinances. Thus you ſee that
the Saints of God are marvellous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
to keepe God in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> But may not a man bee ſaved
without preaching?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer, the argument is clear,
the Saints maintain God in his ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the want of which is under the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
of death and damnation, becauſe
wee have more need of God in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
than of all the gold in the world;
for all the gold in the world will not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:38284:152"/>
a hungry man; It is <hi>bread</hi> that hee
muſt have, becauſe hee hath need of it;
ſo the Saints have moſt need of <hi>God</hi> and
of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> for though they have but rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
coats, and their bodies pincht with
hunger, yet God is hee that they ſtand
moſt in need of. In <hi>Pſalme</hi> the 37. and
the 25. verſe <hi>David</hi> fretted at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity
of the wicked; but at the <hi>laſt</hi> he
breaks of kindly, ſaying, <hi>whom have I in
heaven but thee?</hi> As if hee ſhould have
ſaid, let them have what they will, I will
have nothing but thee. And why ſo?
why? <hi>thou art my ſtrength and my portion
for ever;</hi> marke, hee ſaith that God is his
ſtrength, yea the ſtrength of his heart,
hereby ſhewing that all the helps in the
world cannot help the heart of man, if
God and Chriſt bee wanting; you were
as good offer a journey to refreſh a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man, or the ayre to feed a hungry man,
as to offer riches, honours and eaſe to
help a diſtreſſed ſoule. Theſe will never
help a man; hee may well dote upon
them, but his ſoule and conſcience will
be galled and troubled ſtill; it muſt bee
the God of peace that muſt ſpeak peace
to troubled ſoules. It muſt bee the God
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:38284:153"/>
of peace that muſt ſpeak peace to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed
ſoule, to a ſoule that is damned in
it ſelfe; it is hee that muſt ſay, I will bee
the ſtrength of their hearts, and their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for ever; no marvell then if a poor
ſoule cryes to God, when happily the
heart is full, when the ſoul gnaws and cries
within it ſelfe, I am damned, I am dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
happily the palate is pleaſed with
delicates, when the poor ſoule for ought
it knowes muſt goe down to hell; oh
then beloved, if you will have ſafety,
goe where God is; for every good gift
comes in with him; if once a man hath got
God into his company, hee hath all good
things with him. God bleſſed <hi>Obed E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi>
houſe for the Arkes ſake; now the
Arke was a type of Chriſt, and where it
came, many bleſſings came with it; even
ſo when God comes unto a people they
are married unto him in righteouſneſſe, in
judgement, in loving kindneſſe and in
mercies for ever, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2. 9. When a
man is married to a wife, all is his; ſo get
Chriſt and all is thine, and then what
wouldſt thou have more?</p>
               <p>God ſpeaks to the <hi>raine,</hi> and it heares;
to the <hi>corne,</hi> and it heares; but if thou be
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:38284:153"/>
in Chriſt, hell and death are thy ſervants;
but they that have outward things only,
as profits, pleaſures or the like, they have
their ruine, unleſſe they have Chriſt with
them; get Chriſt therefore, for if hee be
wanting all outward and inward dangers
befall that man; or that Nation; woe be
unto him or them that are without God.
For though they bring up their children,
yet will I bereave them, that there ſhall
not bee man left; yea woe alſo to them,
when I doe depart from them; <hi>Ephraim,</hi>
as <hi>Tyrus</hi> is planted in a pleſant place: but
<hi>Ephraim</hi> ſhall bring forth his children to
the murderer, <hi>Hoſea</hi> the 9. 12, 13. verſes.
True indeed, woe bee unto that heart,
County or Kingdome, that God is depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from; when God who is the God of
mercies and all conſolation, is departed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
who can but pitty that ſoule, County
or Kingdome who will not ſubmit to
Gods peace conſolation and ſalvation?
when God parts, all miſeries follow; for
that man that makes no conſcience in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faceing
God in the Congregation, mark
what the text ſaith <hi>Dent.</hi> 28. 15. I will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
them, and many miſeries ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
them, and when the floud gates are
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:38284:154"/>
once up, then comes in all evils; And then
they ſhall ſay, are not theſe things come
upon us becauſe God is not with us? If
therfore we would avoid woe and ſorrow,
ſlaying and killing one another; if the wife
would not ſee her husband killed before
her tender eyes, and the man ſee his wife
ſnatcht out of the world by the hands of
wicked men, then leave not God, but
hold him faſt, and then evill dayes, will
depart from us; It is our holding of God
that keepes miſeries from us; oh then what
ſhall wee think of them that are weary of
God, and that ſay to the Almighty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
from us? <hi>Job</hi> 22. 17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob. But are there any amongſt us that are
weary of God?</hi> I hope there are none ſuch
amongſt us.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, thou that art a ſervant, and
rejecteſt the Command of thy Maſter,
in it thou doeſt reject God, and all ſuch as
have a mean conceit of the worſhip of
God and the word of God, and thinke
that prayer or preaching is continued too
long; I ſay, theſe men know not what
they thinke or ſay, but certainly it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they would be freed from the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance;
of God: well, God will free
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:38284:154"/>
thee from them one day, I will warrant
thee, and then thou wilt bee in a miſerable
condition; oh that thou wouldeſt pitty thy
poor condition; but thou that art <hi>weary</hi>
of Gods ordinances and of his mercies,
his preſence and patience, know thou that
thou ſhalt bee deprived of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
and thy portion ſhall bee with thoſe
that hate God in this life here, and after
this life (if thou repent not) thy portion
ſhall bee with them in Tophet where the
worme dyeth not, and where the fire go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not out, and then thy crying will not
availe, God will bee God over thee in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
yea when he hath ſpurned thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauds
and ten thouſands into hell, ſuch as
thou art, then ſhalt thou bee the everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
object of his never dying wrath,
then notwithſtanding all thy ſhrill cryes,
though thou couldeſt be heard out of that
dungeon, yet were thy help never the
near; for God is God ſtill. I adviſe thee
therefore what to do, whilſt thou art here
in this life, make thy peace with God in
Chriſt, and lay thy ſelfe low before him,
and bear patiently his hand in his wrath
which thou haſt deſerved. And marke
what I ſay, thou haſt deſerved to bee in
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:38284:155"/>
hell an hundred times, that is the leaſt;
and therefore bee contented with thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
for thou haſt choſen death rather
than life: and God ſhould wrong himſelfe
and thee alſo, if he ſhould not let thee have
thy chooſing.</p>
               <p>Will not theſe things move you, my
brethren? Me thinks <hi>I</hi> ſee your colours
riſe, <hi>I</hi> am glad of it, <hi>I</hi> hope it is to a good
end; you may be wiſe, and happily ſo wiſe
as to chooſe life rather then death: Now
the Lord grant it, for ſee delights not in
your deſtruction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> will adde one word more, to leave the
more impreſſion in your hearts; my deſire
is the health of your ſoules; though my
meat ſeem ſowre, yet my minde is the will
of God. Thou man or woman, that canſt
not abide ſo much Preaching, but ſtandeſt
upon thorns whilſt it is preaching: <hi>Too
much of one thing</hi> (you ſay) <hi>is good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi>
You do as much as ſay you will not
have God with you; you will have a little
of God, but you will have more of your
pleaſures: is this your deſire, your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights?
Know then, whoſoever thou art,
that haſt an ill will to God and his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
and wilt not have the goſpel in
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:38284:155"/>
the purity of it; thou ſhalt have thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires:
Thou ſayeſt, <hi>depart Preachings,</hi> and
ſo it ſhall, thou ſhalt, have thy deſires.
When thou ſhalt hear the trumpets ſound,
and when thine eares ſhall tingle with the
ſound of war; then depart for ever, you
that are weary of God, get you down to
hell for ever: Fulfill your baſe luſts (then
will God ſay) for <hi>I</hi> have fed you on earth
this twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, nay ſixty
yeares and upwards, and my milde Word
could not rule you nor prevail with you,
and therefore now get you to hell, and
there remain for ever. Think thus with
your ſelves; will God ſerve me thus? yea
that he will, for he hath prepared a place,
for the proudeſt Kings, Princes, Monarchs
Captains, &amp;c. that are, or ever were in the
world, if they will not be ruled nor guided
by God, and his word. See <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 33.
the Text doth as good as ſay, he delighteth
to make bonfires about their eares: And
muſt this be the way to glorifie God?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But ſome may ſay,</hi> ſurely Kings and
Monarchs are exempted, they need not fear
that ſuch torments ſhall come upon them.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer, that God will ſay unto
them, raign there if thou wilt, and then
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:38284:156"/>
they ſhall know that there is a King that
laughs at their deſtruction. Take notice
of this I beſeech you, and reaſon thus
with your own ſoules: Is he a good ſonne
that cannot abide the preſence of his own
father? is ſhe a good wife that cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide
the company of her husband? and
is he a good Chriſtian that cannot endure
the company of Chriſt in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances?</p>

                  <hi>This may ſerve to rebuke Gods people for

Chriſt is departing, he is going to ſeek bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
entertainment. (But I marvaile you
give no better attendance; I pray hearken
what I ſay and have to ſay, ſtand up and
heare, and the Lord give you grace to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.)
I will deale plainly with you; as
ſure as God is God, God is going from
<hi>England.</hi> Shall <hi>I</hi> tell you what God told
me? nay <hi>I</hi> muſt tell you on pain of my
life; Will you give eare and believe me?
<hi>I</hi> am a poor Ambaſſador ſent from God
to do his meſſage unto you; and although
<hi>I</hi> be low, yet my meſſage is from above,
and He that ſent me is great, and from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove;
and oh that He would grant that
this my meſſage might be believed! What
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:38284:156"/>
if <hi>I</hi> ſhould tell you, that God told me
(yeſternight) that he would deſtory <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and lay it waſte? What ſay you to
this, my beloved? it is my meſſage, by
meditation is Gods word, that he bid me
do to you, and he expects and anſwer from
you: <hi>I</hi> do my meſſage as God commanded
me; what ſayeſt thou unto it, <hi>England?
I</hi> muſt return an anſwer to my Maſter that
ſent me, yea this preſent right <hi>I</hi> muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
an anſwer; for the Lord hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a ſet time, ſaying, <hi>To morrow the Lord
will do this thing in the Land,</hi> Exod. 9. 5.
Why ſpeak you not? an anſwer you muſt
give: Do you think well of it? will you
have <hi>England</hi> deſtoyed? will you put the
aged to trouble, and your young men to
the ſword? will you have your your young
women widows, and your virgins defiled?
will you have your deare and tender little
ones toſſed upon the pikes and daſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the ſtones? or will you have them
brought up in Poperie, in idolatrie, under
a neceſſity of periſhing their ſouls for ever,
which is worſt of all? Will you have theſe
Temples wherein we ſeeme to worſhip
God, will you have them and your houſes
burnt with fire, and will you ſee <hi>England</hi>
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:38284:157"/>
laid waſte without inhabitants? are you
well contented it ſhall be ſo? I am an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
ſuitor for Chriſt, oh ſend me
not ſad away, but ſpeak comfortably and
cheerfully, what are you reſolved of? Are
you willing to enjoy God ſtill, and to hve
him dwell with you? it is well, <hi>I</hi> am glad
of it if it be ſo; but you muſt not only
ſay ſo, but you muſt uſe the means, and
you muſt plead importunately with your
God: for although his ſword be drawn,
and in his hand, lifted up and readie to
ſtrike; yet ſuffer him not to deſtroy, but
rather to ſheath his ſword in the blood of
his enemies. <hi>I</hi> would be glad to have
<hi>England</hi> flouriſh ſtill; but if deſolation do
come, thank your ſelves for it, it is your
own fault if you bee deſtroyed, and not
Gods, for he delights not in the death of
any. We may juſtly take up the complaint
of the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> who ſaith, No man
ſtirreth up himſelfe to lay hold on God,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. 7. But this is our comfort, or rather
our miſery, that we have quiet proſperitie,
with eaſe and commoditie, our bellies full,
our coffers full, and our backs curiouſlie
clothed, &amp;c. not remembring the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of our neighbour Nations; but all is
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:38284:157"/>
well with us, and it will ſerve our turnes:
and if we do humble our ſelves a little, we
think it is well. And thus we play mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holiday
with God and with his gospel, in
making it out pack-horſe. Well, look to
it, for God is going, and if he do go, then
our glorie goes alſo; and then we may
ſay with <hi>Phineahs</hi> wife, I <hi>Sam.</hi> 4. 22.
<hi>Glory is departed from Iſrael,</hi> ſo glory is
departed from <hi>England;</hi> for <hi>England</hi> hath
ſeen her beſt daies, and the reward of ſin
is comming on apace; for God is packing
up of his goſpel, becauſe none will buy his
wares: God begins to ſhip away his <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs,</hi>
which propheſied and foretold that
deſtruction was neer; and God makes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
that <hi>New-England</hi> ſhall be a refuge
for his <hi>Noahs</hi> and his <hi>Lots,</hi> a rock and a
ſhelter for his righteous ones to run unto;
and thoſe that were vexed to ſee the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
lives of the people in this wicked
Land, ſhall there be ſafe. Oh therefore
my brethren, lay hold on God, and let him
not go out of your coaſts; look about you
<hi>I</hi> ſay, and ſtop him at the townſ-end, and
let not thy God depart, O <hi>England,</hi> lay
ſiege about him by humble and heartie
cloſing with him; and although he be
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:38284:158"/>
going, he is not yet gone; ſuffer him not
to goe farr, ſuffer him not to ſay fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
or rather fare ill <hi>England;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
becauſe I will doe thus unto thee,
prepare to meet the God of <hi>Iſrael</hi> O
<hi>England.</hi> Amos 4. 12. Now God calls
upon thee, as he did ſometime upon <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi>
Jer 6. 8. Bee thou inſtructed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
O <hi>England,</hi> leaſt my ſoule depart from
thee, and leaſt I make thee deſolate like
a Land that none inhabiteth; and thus
we ſee what the godly have done before
us, and now let it bee our Coppie, and
let us with <hi>Mary</hi> claſpe cloſe about Chriſt;
they have broke the Ice, let us follow
them: this is our day of atonement; this
preſent day is ours, wee have nothing to
doe with tomorrow; wee are at odds with
God; and this is the day of our reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
this is the day wherein we are to
make our peace with our God; and to
end all controverſies, let us labour therfore
to prevail with God, and that we may not

3. 1. ſhe ſought him, but ſhe could not
find him, yet ſhe gave not over but ſhee
followed him till ſhe found him; So our
God is going, and ſhall we ſit ſtill? would
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:38284:158"/>
you have the Goſpel kept with lazie
wiſhes, Oh no, no; ariſe, ariſe from your
downy beds, and fall down upon your
knees, and intreat God to leave his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
to you and to your poſteritie; ſhall
wee by our ſins diſinherit our Infants
and poſteritie of ſuch a bleſſing which
is or ſhould bee the life of there lives?
and ſo have them brought up in ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition?
no, no; Lord we cannot abide
this, Oh give us neither wealth nor any
other bleſſing but thy Goſpell; this is our
Plea Lord; and when have found God
then let us bring him home to our houſes,
and there retaine him, that ſo he may be
our God and the God of our poſterity,
in all our and their afflictions; and this
will make you to rejoyce exceedingly;
Oh my beloved carry God whom with
you, and let him be a Father to you and
to your poſterity.</p>
               <p>Queſt. But now may wee keep the Lord, it
would he worth our labour; for at his
right hand there are pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Firſt, wee muſt be ſure to <hi>prepare
a room</hi> for him; for he is a King, and a
King you know ſends his harbinger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:38284:159"/>
him to prepare a roome for him; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come out of her my people and touch
no unclean thing, and then I will be thy
God and thou ſhalt be my people 2. <hi>Cor.</hi>
6. 17. ſo my beloved brethren, come out
of all ſinfull courſes, pleaſures, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and you may expect Gods comming
unto your houſes; And when you ſit
downe by your fires, or lie downe in
your beds, think thus with your ſelves,
what an equall condition doth God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound,
it is but only to part with a ſin, a
luſt, a Dalilah, which I may very well
ſpare, as well as I may ſpare water out of
my ſhooes, or a coale out of my boſome;
I ſay thinke thus with thy ſelfe and ſay in
thy heart, will God keep Company with
mee, if I will not keep Company with ſin?
are the termes no harder? this is a good
offer; I will at once then bid ſin adue;
for now I am upon another bargaine;
here is an offer that I was nor aware of;
I will quickly diſpatch this bargaine and
make my peace with my God; and thus if
you would have God to bee yours, then
let your ſoules and bodies be his by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking
all ſins; and when you ſhall call,
God will come and ſay here am <hi>I, Eſay.</hi>
58. 9.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:38284:159"/>
Secondly, as you muſt prepare a room
for God, ſo you muſt <hi>give him content</hi> too;
let God have his will croſſe him not.
Where the King is, he will have all things
to his minde, even ſo it is with God, If he
may have his own worſhip, you pleaſe him
wonderous well; you muſt dreſſe his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes
according to his tooth; but if you put
poyſon into his meat, if you mingle the
traditions of men with Gods worſhip,
then you <hi>diſcontent</hi> him. Lay aſide there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
all your ſuperſtitions, and erronious
opinions of God and his worſhip, and do
it according to his <hi>will</hi> in his word <hi>reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi>
and then yon pleaſe him indeed; when
a Nation or a ſoule ſubmits to God and to
his truth in all things. To bow at the name
Jeſus, is not meant at the <hi>word</hi> Jeſus for
ſo to give him the bow is to commit ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicall
Idolatrie; but the meaning is, wee
ſhould worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth,
humbly ſubjecting our ſelves unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, as we muſt give him his mind,
ſo wee muſt give him <hi>welcome,</hi> if you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe
God and look loweringly or ſower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
upon him, and grudge at God or at his
truth, no wonder then if God goe away;
land ſurely this is the ſinne of <hi>England,</hi>
                  <pb n="292" facs="tcp:38284:160"/>
we bear an ill will unto God and his word,
and God hath done well for this Land, and
what could hee have done more then hee
hath done for this Land, as hee ſaith of his
vineyard? <hi>Eſay</hi> 5. 4, 5. but it brought
forth contrary fruit; even ſo wee doe all
contrary to Gods expectation; mark there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what God ſaith, hee will take away
the hedge, and it ſhall be trodden down;
and for ought that may be collected, ſo it
is like to bee with us, if his mercy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
it not; for, are wee better than the
old world? the ſame ſins that were found
in the old world, are found in us; <hi>Sodom's</hi>
and <hi>Gomorahs</hi> ſinnes were but ſtrawes in
reſpect of ours; and yet God rained down
fire and brimſtone upon them; tell me,
are there not as great ſinnes amongſt us
as were in <hi>Jeruſolem,</hi> who were carried
captives, their city deſtroyed, and they a
vagabond people untill this day? Are we
better then other Brethren and neighbour
Nations, that have drunk ſo deeply of
Gods wrath? I tell you truly, we area
burden to God, he cannot long beare us,
and he will think his burthen well over
when he hath deſtroyed us. You know
all men are glad when their <hi>pain</hi> is over;
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:38284:160"/>
even ſo it is with God, we are a pain and a
trouble unto him and why ſhould God go
continually pained with us, which are
worthy to be deſtroyed? Then ſhall
<hi>England</hi> ſeek peace, but ſhall not find it,
God ſhall not pity us: Oh, my beloved
brethren, what a pitifull thing it is, when
a mercifull God ſhall ſhew himſelf unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull
when his patience ſhall be turned
into impatience? There is a hard time
ere long befalling <hi>England,</hi> if God in mercy
prevent it not; but we do not conſider it,
lamentable is our time. Chriſt wept over
Jeruſalem; <hi>Oh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that thou hadſt
known in this thy day of viſitation, the things
that do concern thy peace! but now thy are
hid from thine eyes</hi> Beloved, what do you
think we ſhall do, when Gods mercies are
turned into juſtice? Look to it <hi>England,</hi>
the Lord hath wept over thee in mercy
many years; What ſhall we do when we
have leiſure to conſider what once we did
enjoy? for Gods patience is never truly
prized, till we want it; and then the poor
ſoul will thus ſay: There was a time when
we might have been at peace with this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
God, but now he is hid from our eyes,
now the gate is ſhut, barred and locked up.
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:38284:161"/>
thus when a people doth <hi>abuſe</hi> Gods mercy
hee ſends the contrary judgements, and
then it will grieve and wound our ſoules
to think what once wee did enjoy; but
that ſoule that will bid God <hi>welcome</hi> to his
heart, may goe <hi>ſinging</hi> to his grave.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>You muſt be importunate with
God to tarry, and account it a great favour
if he will ſtay:</hi> For God hath roome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
in heaven, and therefore you need
not lodge him for want of lodging, but
you muſt be beholding to him to tarry
with you (yet in theſe dayes men doe not
love to be beholding;) <hi>Jacob</hi> wreſtled with
God, and by that meanes he held him till
he bleſſed him: you live under the <hi>meanes,</hi>
and know the way, and will you not doe
it? what greater condemnation can there,
be, and how great will your judgement be
unto you, more then unto them that
have no meanes? and as it was ſaid of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum,</hi>
ſo ſay I to <hi>England,</hi> Thou <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
that was lifted up to heaven with
<hi>meanes,</hi> ſhalt be brought down to hel; thou
ſhalt be abuſed for it; for if the mighty
works which hath been done in thee, had
been done in India or Turkie, they would
have repented ere this time; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:38284:161"/>
                  <hi>Capernums place</hi> is <hi>Englands</hi> place,
