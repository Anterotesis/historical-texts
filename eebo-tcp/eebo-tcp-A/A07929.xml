            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

his great mercy hath bestowedon me, no doubt as well for the benefite of others as of my selfe: I haue thought it worth the labour to set downe my chiefest motives, by which and through which next vnder God, I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade to renounce the Romish faith and religion: as who per swade my selfe constantly, that what soever papist in the whole world, shall with an indifferent iudgement peruse the same, having are solved mind to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the truth when it appeareth: that selfe same papist will vtterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce with me, the false, erroneous, &amp; execrable doctrine of the Church of Rome.

And consequently, that great learned men of all ages since popery began, yea, in the very altitude of popedome and in the Church of Rome: have approoved, holden, and defended, weighty and important points of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: contrary to the doctrine of the Church of Rome.

               <hi>The Preface generall to the Christian</hi> Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit <hi>I</hi> will not now dispute, whether the Bishops of Rome be that Antichrist, of whome the Apostle spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <note place="margin">2. Thess. 2. v. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</note> to the Thessalonians, or no? (notwithstanding the affirmative be the iudgement of sundry great learned men;) yet dare <hi>I,</hi> and doe I boldly avouch, that Bishops of Rome have for many yeres past, bene the precursors and fore-runners of that very Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, whereof mention is alreadie made: which to hold and thinke, many weightie and important reasons have mooved me. For first, <note place="margin">1</note> who but Antichrist, or his precursor, will either ascribe, or suffer to be ascribed unto him: such power of maiestie, and titles of Deietic, as are proper and peculiar to God aloue? And yet is this to be verified of the pope undoubtedlie, by the popes owne doctrine, and his popish doctors. The pope (if we will beleeve him) telleth us: that God, when he instituted two great lights in the firmament: to wit, the Sunne and the Moone: signified thereby, the autoritie of popes and of kings: gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us to understand, that the pope is as farre above a king in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, as is the Sunne above the Moone in excellencie: yea, he addeth further; that Kings and Emperors have no power, to draw the sword against popish bishops &amp; priestes: as who forsooth, are not subiect to their iurisdiction. And least I should be thought, to father untruthes upon the pope: I will (which is my wonted manner throughout my whole booke,) alledge his owne wordes, which are these: <hi>Ad fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mamentum</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Greg. 9. lib. 1. decret. tit. 33. cap. 6.</note> 
               <hi>coeli, hoc est, universalis ecclesiae, fecit Deus duo magna luminaria, id est, duas instituit dignitates, quae sunt, Pontificalis autoritas, &amp; Regalis po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testas: sed illa, quae praeest diebus, id est, spiritualibus, maior est: quae vero carna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus, minor: ut, quanta est inter solem &amp; lunam, tanta inter Pontifices &amp; Reges differentia cognoscatur.</hi> To the firmament of heaven, that is, of the universall Church, God made two great lightes: to wit, ordeined two great dignities, which are the authoritie of the Pope, and the power of the King: but that power, which ruleth spiritual things, is greater: and that which ruleth things carnal, is lesser: that so great difference may be knowen betweene Popes and kings, as is betweene the sunne and the moone. The popish glosse in the same place, setteth downe <note place="margin">Glossa. ibid.</note> precisely, how farre the King is inferiour to the Pope, in these words: <hi>Restat, ut Pontificalis dignitas quadragesies septies sit maior regali dignitate.</hi> It therefore remaineth, that the pontificality of the Pope is seven &amp; fourtie times greater, then is the regalitie of the king. Pope Gregory <note place="margin">Gregor. ubi supra.</note> saith further, in this expresse maner: <hi>Intelligendum non est, quòd Rex vel Imperator super bonos &amp; malos gladii acceperit potestatem; sed in eos solum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modò, qui utentes gladio eius sunt iurisdictioni commissi.</hi> We must not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that the King or Emperour hath receiued power of the sworde
<pb facs="tcp:1677:4"/>
over the good and the evill; but onely over them, who using the sword are committed to his iurisdiction. Behold, how the Scripture is tossed and wrested: to take from kings, that power which God hath given them. The popish parasites, the glossators of the Canons, ascribe more magnificall and plaine divine titles unto the Pope; even such as no way can be denied, to be proper and peculiar to God alone. These are their expresse words: <hi>Sic (Papa) dicitur habere coeleste arbitrium, &amp; ideò</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Glossat. lib. 1. decretat. tit. 7. cap. 3.</note> 
               <hi>etiam naturam rerum immutat, substantialia unius rei applicando alij; &amp; de ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilo potest aliquid facere.</hi> So the pope is said to have celestial arbitreme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and therefore doeth he alter the nature of things, by application of the substantiall partes of one thing to another; &amp; he can make of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing something. Thus verily do they write, and yet no greater blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy can be uttered. Ioannes Gerson, though otherwise a great pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist, maketh rehearsal of intollerable dignities, and titles ascribed to the pope; which notwithstanding the pope himselfe hath acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged as pertaining to him, but the said Gerson them reprooveth &amp; derideth. These be his expresse words: <hi>Consurgit ex adver so blandiens &amp;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Gerson. de potestat. ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. consider. 12. part. 3.</note> 
               <hi>subdola adulatio; &amp; ad aures Ecclesiasticorum praecipuè summi Pontificis insu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrans; ô quanta quanta est sublimitas ecclesiasticae potestatis tuae? quonians sicut Christo collata est omnis potest as in coelo &amp; in terra, sic eam Christus om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim Petro suisque successoribus dereliquit. Vnde nec Constantinus quicquam Sylvestro papae contulit, quod non esset priùs suum; sedreddidit iniustè detentum. Porrò, sicut non est potest as nisià Deo, sicnec aliqua temporalis velecclesiastica, imperialis, velregalis, nisià Papa: in cuius foemore scripsit Christus, Rex regum, Dominus dominantium; de cuius potestate disputare, instar sacrilegij est; cui neque quisquam dicere potest, cur ita facis? mentior si non inveniantur haec scripta, ab illis etiam qui sapientes sunt in oculis suis.</hi> There starteth up on the contrarie side faire-spoken and craftie adulation: whispering in the eares of Clergie men, especially of the pope; Oh how great, how great is the Maiestie of thine Ecclesiasticall power? for as all povver vvas given to Christ, in heaven and on earth; So Christ left all the same power, to Peter and his Successours. VVherefore the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour Constantine gave nothing to Pope Sylvester, which was not his owne before; but onely restored that, which was uniustly deteined from him. Further, as there is no power but of God, so is there nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any temporall or Ecclesiasticall, Imperiall or Regall, but of the Pope; in vvhose thigh Christ hath vvritten, the King of Kinges, and Lord of Lordes; of whose power to dispute, is as meere sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge; to whome no man may say, VVhy doest thou so? I am a lyar, if these thinges be not written: even of them, who are vvise in their owne conceites. These are Doctor Gersons wordes: vvho though he vvere a great Papist, yet could he not digest these Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian blasphemies, neither hide or conceale them vvithin his

breast. Neverthelesse Pope Bonifacius did not onely acknovvledge them, but vvith great pleasure practised the same, as vvitnesseth the said Gerson in these vvordes: <hi>Hanc existimationem habuisse, visus est Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifacius</hi>

Others thinke, that the deposition of (Childericus) the French King by Pope Zacharias, vvas grounded in this (Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian and godlesse conceit:) as if for soothe the Pope vvere he, that coulde depose Princes, and translate their kingdomes. And our Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite Bellarminus, is so farre from blushing at this most detestable fact of Pope Zacharie: that he yeeldeth the reason <hi>si dijs placet,</hi> for the iustification thereof. <hi>Childericum (inquit) deposuit Papa, &amp; in eius</hi>

               <hi>locum Pipinum Caroli magni patrem Regem creari iussit: cuius causa fuit, quia propter socordiam Childerici, &amp; Religioni, &amp; Regno in Gallia, extrema ruina imminere videbatur.</hi> The Pope (saith our Iesuite) deposed Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericus, and commaunded to place Pipinus father to Charles the great, in his throne. The cause vvhereof was this; because forsooth through the negligent governement of Childericus, the Kingdome and Religion of Fraunce seemed to be in great daunger. Thus saith the Popes vassall; out of vvhose vvordes I gather first, that so much may be truely verified of Popes, as Gerson hath avovvched. <note place="margin">1</note>
            </p>
            <p>I gather secondly, that the Pope chalengeth both svvordes, and himselfe to be not onely universall Bishoppe, but universall King <note place="margin">2</note> also over all the vvorld.</p>
            <p>I gather thirdly, that the Iesuites (hovvsoever they dissemble by their fondly imagined aequivocation,) thinke of our most gratious <note place="margin">3</note> Soveraigne Queene Elizabeth, and meane to doe vvith her most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Maiestie, as the Pope thought and did vvith Childericus; and for that end <hi>saltem secundariò,</hi> are so many Iesuites sent seditiously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Secundò principalitèr.</note> this land.</p>
            <p>Secondly, my L. Abbot their ovvne deare Bernard, savve in his time such tyrannie and Antichristian dealing in the Church of Rome, as hee vvas thereby and therevvith enforced to exclame in these wordes: <hi>Tempus faciendinunc, quia dissipaverunt legem. bestia illa de A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalypsi,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Bernar. ad Gaufridum, epist. 125.</note> 
               <hi>cui datum est os loquens blasphemias, &amp; bellum gerere cum Sanctis, Petri Cathedram occupat, tanquam Leo paratus ad praedam.</hi> It is novve high time to doe good, for they have troden under foote Gods Lavve. That beast mentioned in the Revelation, to vvhome vvas gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a mouth speaking blasphemies, and to make vvarres vvith the Saintes: sitteth in the chaire of Peter, as a Lyon ready to take his praye.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1677:5"/>
Thirdly, the Pope doeth not onely take upon him, to depose kings and Emperours him selfe; but he avovvcheth further, that Subiectes <note place="margin">3</note> may and are bounden to depose their dread Soveraignes, vvhensoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they decline to infidelity: which certes is by popish interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vvhen any King or Queene embraceth syncerely the holy Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of Christ, and denyeth Romish poperie. For thus vvriteth Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larminus, vvhose doctrine the Pope hath lately approoved; <hi>At si isti ijdem principes conantur avertere populum a fide, omnium consensu possunt</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Robertus Bellarminus lib. 5. de Rom. Pontif. cap. 7.</note> &amp; <hi>debent privari suo dominio.</hi> But if these Princes goe about, to avert the people from the faith (of the Church of Rome:) then by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of all, they may and must be dispossessed, of their Scepters and Regalities.</p>
            <p>Againe, in the second Chapter he saith thus: <hi>Quòd si Christiani olim</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Bellarm. cod. cap.</note> 
               <hi>non deposuerunt Neronem, &amp; Diocletianum, &amp; Iulianum apostatam, ac Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentem Arianum, &amp; similes; id fuit, quia deerant vires temporales Christianis.</hi> If the Christians in times past, deposed not Nero, Diocletian, Iulian, Valens, and such like Emperours; the cause thereof was, for that they wanted povver and force, and vvere not strong ynough for that attempt. Againe, a little after he hath these vvordes: <hi>At non tenen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Christiani, immò nec debent cum evidenti periculo religionis, toler are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Bellarm. cap. codem.</note> 
               <hi>infidelom.</hi> But Christians are not bounde to tolerate a King, that is an Infidell, (or not a Papist;) nay, they must not tolerate such a one, vvith the evident daunger of Religion. And our said Iesuite yeeldeth this reason hereof; because forsooth saith he, <hi>De iure humanoest, quod hunc aut illum habeamus Regem.</hi> For it is by the Lavve of man, that vve <note place="margin">Bellarm. ubi supra.</note> have this or that man to our King. This is the doctrine of our Popes, and lately hatched Iesuites: out of vvhich most disloyall and unchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian assertion;</p>
            <p>I inferre first, that the Pope and Iesuites vvould most vvillingly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive our most gratious Soveraigne of her Royall throne and Rega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie; <note place="margin">1</note> if they vvere of force and povver so to doe.</p>
            <p>I inferre seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, that our Iesuite doth here approve peremptorily. <note place="margin">2</note>
            </p>
            <p>First, the diabolical excommunication of Pope Pius.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the disloyal fact of Murton, vvho brought the same into this Realme.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, the publishing thereof by Felton.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, the practising of the curse by Sanders, Fitz-morice, Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard, and others their seditious complices.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, the renevving of the print, and dispersing of the copies in Rome, by our Iesuites, Persons, and Campion; as a compendious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative, for their commodious entrance into this land.</p>
            <p>I inferre thirdly, that all subiects are by this doctrine, stirred up and encouraged to manifest rebellion; &amp; to have no scruple of conscience <note place="margin">3</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:1677:5"/>
therein. The reason hereof is evident, because if kinges receive their authoritie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> man, as this Iesuit auoucheth: then may kings indeed be displaced by man, as Romish parasites, and irreligious politikes beare the world in hand. yet Salomon the vvise replenished vvith ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie inspiration, teacheth vs another doctrine: <hi>Per me inquit, reges reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Prou. c. 8. 15.</note> &amp; <hi>legum conditores iusta decernunt. per me principes imperant, &amp; poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes decernunt iustitiam.</hi> By mee (saith God in Salo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon) kings reigne, and princes decree iustice. By me princes rule, and all nobles, and iudges of the earth. And the Apostle saith: <hi>Omnts anima potestatibus</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. c. 13. v. 1.</note> 
               <hi>sublimioribus subdita sit: non est enim potestas nisia Deo.</hi> Let everie soule bee subiect to higher powers: for ther is no power but of God. But here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of more at large, in the sixt chapter and third conclusion of the second booke. Fourthlie, Sylvester Pryeras that great popish Thomist, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <note place="margin">4</note> vs roundlie and malepertlie: that empires and regalities are not from God immediatlie, but from God by meanes of the pope. And he saith further, that royall power is so subordinate to poperie, or papacie: as is the Moone vnto the Sunne. These are his owne wordes: <hi>Nec obstat, quod potestas imperialis est a deo concessa secundum mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Sylvest. de papa. para. 2.</note> 
               <hi>iura: quia est a Deo, mediante papa: quia eam concedit non vt homo, sed vt vicarius Det. Nec sunt sic distinctae potestates, spiritualis scilicet &amp; temporalis: quin vna alteri subalternetur, ad instar lunae &amp; solis: nec sunt distinctae, quasi semper sint in diversis: sed quia sunt ordinatae ad distincta, scilicet spiritualia &amp; temporalia: &amp; in vno eodem<expan>

                     </am>
                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> summo pontifiee, est vtraque in summo.</hi> It skilleth not, that manie lawes affirme imperiall power to be of God. For it is from God, the Pope being the meane, who graunteth it not as man, but as the vicar of God. Neither are the two powers, (the spirituall and the temporall,) so distinct: but that they remaine sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate the one to the other, after the resemblance of the sunne &amp; moone. neither are they distinct as being alwaies in diuerse subiects, but as ordeined to distinct thinges, spiritual and temporall. For they both are in one and the selfe same pope, even in the highest degree. Fiftlie, such as is the ruler of the citie, (saith Bellarminus our Iesuit,) <note place="margin">5</note> such are the inhabitants thereof: But pope Boniface the eight entred <note place="margin">Bellar. derom. pontif. lib. 5. cap. 7.</note> into his popedome as a Foxe, reigned in it as a woolfe, and died out of it as a dogge, as I haue proved in my 2. booke, in the 3. chapter &amp; second conclusion: <hi>ergo</hi> all the citizens of Rome in his time began as foxes, continued as wolves, and ended their daies as dogges: and consequentlie, the whole church of Rome during the time of Pope Boniface: was wicked, diabolicall, and meere antichristian. what shall I say of kissing the popes foote? of bearing the pope vpon mens shoulders? of the popes dispensing with the law humane, the lawe of nature, and the law divine? these may suffice, to teach vs to walke warelie, to looke about vs withall circumspection, to be verie care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full what doctrine we embrace: and ever to set before our eies, the
<pb facs="tcp:1677:6"/>
admonitions and premonitions of our sauiour Iesus Christ. <hi>Attendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, inquit Dominus, a fermento Pharisaeorum quodest hypocrisis.</hi> Beware saith our Lord, of the leven of the Pharises, that is, their false doctrine, infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <note place="margin">Luc. 12. 2.</note> and infatuated vvith the traditions of men: as it is expounded in another place of the gospel. VVe must therefore here observe, that in the scribes and Pharisees rested in those daies the ordinarie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall face, power, regiment, and iurisdiction of the church. For so saith our saviour, in another place of the gospell: <hi>In cathedra Mosis</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 13.</note> 
               <hi>sedent Scribae &amp; Pharisaei: omnia ergo quaecunque praeceperint vobis servare, servate &amp; facite.</hi> The Scribes and Pharisees sit in the chaire of Moses: therefore, whatsoever they shall commaund you to keepe, that keepe <note place="margin">Mat. 23. 3.</note> and doe. VVherefore since our Lord commaundeth vs, to beware of the hypocriticall doctrine of the Pharisees, who had the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in the visible Church of that age: and since Christ commaunded this for no other end, but because they had corrupted the sacred &amp; pure word of God, with the mixture of their owne foolish traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for that Christ obiected against them, saying: <hi>Quare &amp; vostrans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredimini mandatum Dei, propter traditiouem vestram:</hi> why doe you tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse Gods commaundement, for the accomplishment of your own <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 3.</note> tradition? and in another place: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: But in vaine doe they worship mee, teaching <note place="margin">Mat. 15. 9.</note> doctrines the commaundements of men: since I say, our saviour thus commaundeth vs: it followeth, that we must refuse, reiect, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne, all prelates, all bishops, all priestes, and all whosoever have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie administration in the church, by what name or title soever they be called: if they deliver to vs the word of God impurelie, or mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with traditions of men: and consequentlie, that we must reiect and renounce, the pope, and all the rable of popish cleargie-men: as who do either not deliver the word of God at all, or at least so min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled, so pestered, so corrupted, so adulterated with mans traditions: as no part there of remaineth sound, pure, and intire. It then standeth vs vpon, to employ our whole care, studie, and industrie, that we may liue secure from the leaven of these Pharisees: that is, of these popes and popish vassalles: who in steede of christian doctrine, doe hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criticallie deliver vnto vs, yea with threats of fire and faggot enforce vpon vs, the present poison of our soules. For if he that sitteth in Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters chaire be Antichrist, as vvitnesseth their owne Bernard: if the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of Rome have written in their thighes, the king of kinges and Lord of Lords, as their Gerson avoucheth: if all power asvvell civill as ecclesiasticall be chalenged of popes, as their Silvester affirmeth: if popes can place and displace kinges and Emperours, and dispossesse them of their regalities, and royall seats, as their Iesuit Bellarmine boasteth: if the bishops of Rome be as farre above kinges in auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as is the Sunne above the Moone in excellencie, as pope Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
<pb facs="tcp:1677:6"/>
teacheth: if no king can draw the sword against any of his subiects, being cleargie-men without the popes good licence and favour, as the said Gregorie telleth vs: if the pope bee taken to be greater then any king by seaven and fourtie fold, as the popish glosse proclaimeth, nay, if the pope applie the substantial parts of one subiect to another: if the pope take vpon him to make of nothing somthing, as affirmeth another glosse: then doubtles doth it necessarilie follow, that if the pope be not that Antichrist, whereof S. Paul. speaketh to the Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians: yet is he perforce that Antichrist, where of Saint Iohn wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in these wordes: <hi>Omnis spiritus qui solvit Iesum, ex Deo non est: &amp; hic est antichristus, de quo audistis quoniam venit, &amp; iam in mundo est.</hi> Everie spirit that dissolveth Iesus, is not of God: and this is Antichrist, of <note place="margin">1.

For not onely they dissolve Iesus, that denie his divinity, or his humanitie, or the hypostaticall vnion of the same: but they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that derogate in anie point from the office auctoritie, and power of Christ, (who is our eternal king, our head, our prophet, our priest:) and in like maner, all they that by any meanes depresse or obscure the same: as doe the papistes, in innumerable particulars: to wit, in their reall inherent iustice, in their condigne merites of workes, in their congruent dispositions, in their massing sacrifice, in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall presence, in their accidents without subiectes, in their lordlie papall primacie, in their purgatorie-purifications, in their satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie supplements, in their disholie supererogations, in their phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical flagellations: &amp; in many other like superstitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, fondly reputed holines. these things are partly proved already: but more fully &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, throughout the whole discourse following, pervse it therfore ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ike as the soule surmounteth the body, in ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall dignity; so doe the diseases of the soule exceed the diseases of the body, in all impiety. And consequently, greater consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to be had in providing remedies for the soule, then for the body. Neverthelesse so it is, that none will or can in deed provide a remedy for that sore, whereof he hath no feeling or intelligence at all. In regard whereof, especially because papistry is of papistes repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no disease or sore; I haue imployed that small talent, which God of his meere mercy hath bestowed on me, to the end that all papistes who shall seriously peruse this my briefe discourse; may with all facilitie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue such to be grievous diseases of the soule, as heretofore they dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be none. But as they that are ignorant of their disease, neither doe nor can provide a soveraigne remedie for the same: in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, neither can they at any time be perfectly cured, who though they knowe both the disease and the medicine for the same, yet will they not apply that medecine vnto their sore. Euen so in the subiect matter: that papist who will not once read this short volume, which unfoldeth the abomination and manifold deformities of popery: and that by most lively and euident demonstration, deduced out of the bowels of pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it selfe: must perforce still remaine in the agonie of his said disease. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, if any papist shall read it, but with a resolved mind to contradict it, and so either rashly to contemne it, or without iust triall to discredit it: Such a papist (as many I feare will be found by sinister perswasion of seditious seminaries,) can not for want of due application, attaine the expected effect otherwise correspondent thereunto. And that thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued papist whosoeuer thou art, maist with more alacrity read this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle booke; I do assure thee, that my proceeding in the discovery of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish

superstitions, vanities, enormities, falshoods, dissentions, errours, heresies, and blasphemies, is such and so sincere; as upon a <hi>salvo conducto</hi> (as they tearm it) granted from any king christian, and license procured of my gracious dread soveraigne; I am and will be most willing, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire into any province in Christendom; there to give an account, and to make triall of the same. Let therefore no popish censurers, commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, or excommunications, terrifie thee from beholding the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wounds of thy soule. Let no sinister perswasions, of such as are wedded to their own imaginations, disswade thee from the reading of this discourse. Let no wilfull conceit so take place in thine heart, as thou wilt rashly condemne it, before thou make due triall therof. Call to mind for Iesus Christ his sake, and for the salvation of thine owne soule; that thou art not this day more zealously affected to Popery, then I my selfe was of late yeres. Adde hereunto for Gods loue, that the perfect and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act knowledge of poperie, which I haue attained by Gods grace and painfull studie; hath so lively set before mine eyes the popish enormities, superstitions, absurdities, errours, impieties, and blasphemies; as upon the due consideration thereof, I could not but loath, detest, and abhorre all papistry; and stand at open defiance with the same. Especially, because at length I perfitly understood, that papistry in all ages, had civill warres against it self. Which thing is made so cleare and manifest by this little book, as more shall not need to be wished. I haue charitably and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully penned it, principally and chiefly for thy sake. And I nothing doubt but through the power of God, it will so sufficiently perswade thee, to use the ordinary meanes of thy salvation; that is, humbly to read the holy scriptures, which hath not heretofore bene thy custome; diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to frequent godly sermons, which are nowe common in this Realme, God be thanked: and often to conferre with zealous preachers, for thy better instruction and sound confirmation; as thou wilt shortly be a greater enemy to popery, then thou wast before a friend thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. For in this small volume thou shalt perceive evidently, that not only popish monkes, fryers, and Iesuites; but also their schoolemen, their Summists, their Canonistes, their Thomistes, their Scotists, their Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots, their Byshops, their Archbishoppes, their Cardinals, yea, and their greatest popes themselues, haue all in their domesticall dissentions and ciuill warres, so battered and made equall with the ground, the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warkes of their popery; as no forraine enemy shall henceforth need, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to stand in feare of their fortresses, or to make assaults against the

So surceasing to speak of their muttering upon beads; their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in straunge tongues; their consecrations of bells, Churches, altars, chalices, patines, corporals, copes, vestments, albes, girdles, tunicles, che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibles, miters; their exorcismes or incantations ouer oyles, chrismes, ashes, palmes, candles, salt, water, bread; their sacrificing upon such altars, in such Churches, before such relikes; to which their sacrifices such sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and merits are ascribed, as that seminary is deemed best disposed for English long intended invasion; who hath occupied himselfe most busily, in that their superstitious kind of doting; their reservations of their bread-gods, often putrified, and now and then of myse devoured; their idolatricall adoration of reliques, especially of their so termed <hi>vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus sanctus:</hi> surceasing I say, from speaking of these and like popish de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liraments, and instantly wishing thy christian conversion in Christ Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, I bid thee heartily fare-well.</p>

This is prooved at large by the testimonies of approved popish doctors, in the second booke and third chapter in the 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. conclusions. The great popish scholeman and Spanish Frier <hi>Victoria,</hi> vvriteth in this manner; by litle and litle, not all at once, vve vvere brought to this in ordinat course, and to this so miserable state, that novv vve are neither a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to endure our griefs, nor such remedies as the church of Rome assigneth for the same. but if vve had this day such good bishops or Popes, as <hi>Clemens, Linus</hi> and <hi>Sylvester</hi> vvere, then might vvee commit all things safely vnto them: but alas to say the best of them, because I vvould not vvillingly reproove them, the Popes novv are farre inferiours to the auncient bishops of Rome.

               <p>The Greekes to this day, do not beleeue that there is a purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. read vvho vvil the commentaries of the auncient Grecians, and he shal find either verie seldome mention of purgatorie, or none at all. for neither did the Latine Church conceive the veritie of this matter at one time, but by leisure. neither vvas it done vvithout the great dispensation of the holy ghost, that after so manie yeares Catholikes both beleeved purgatorie, and received the vse of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons generallie. so long as there vvas no care of purgatorie, no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sought for pardons. for of it dependeth all the estimation, that vve have of pardons. if thou take avvay purgatorie, to vvhat end shall
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1677:11"/>
vve neede pardons? for if their be no purgatorie, vve shall neede no pardons: considering therfore hovv long purgatorie vvas vnknown, then that it vvas beleeved of some by litle and litle, partly by reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and partly by the Scriptures, and so at the last beleeved ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally of the vvhole church, vve do easilie vnderstand the cause of perdons. since therefore purgatorie vvas so lately knovven and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the vniversal church, vvho can novv admire pardons, that there vvas no vse of them in the primitiue Church. pardons therefore began after the people stood in some feare of purgatory. these are the vvords, of this popish bishop. vvhich vvordes, if they be vvel marked vvith all the circumstances, are able vvithout more adoe, to persvvade anie man to detest the Romish religion, for vvhich cause I have alleaged them at large.</p>
               <p n="1">1 First therefore vvee learne here, that the greeke church never beleeved purgatorie to this day.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondly, that the Latine church and church of Rome did not beleeve the said purgatorie, for manie hundreds of yeares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter S. Peters death, vvhose successor the pope boasteth himself to be.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdlie, that this purgatorie vvas not beleeved of all the latine church at one and the same time, but by litle and litle. vvhere note by the vvay, that poperie crept into the church by litle and litle, &amp; not all at one time. vvhich is a point that galleth the papistes, more then a litle I vveene.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Fourthly, that purgatorie vvas beleeved in the latter daies, by speciall revelation of the holie ghost.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Fiftlie, that pardons came not vp, till purgatorie vvas found out. for in purgatorie resteth the life of pardons, as vvhich there being no purgatorie, are not worth a straw.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Sixtly, that purgatorie vvas a long time vnknovven.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Seventhly, that purgatorie could not be found in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of a long time.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Eightlie, that it vvas not vvholie found out by the scriptures, but partlie by revelations.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Ninthly, that pardons vvere not heard of or knovven to the primitive church.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Tenthly, that then pardons began when men began to feare the paines of purgatorie,</p>
               <p>Behold novv gentle reader, vvhat a vvorthie fisher vvas my popish Lord of Rochester? hee hath caught vvith his net at one draughtten goodly fishes, that is to say, ten vvorthy observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for Christian aedification. Further then this, out of the seventh and eight observations, I gather three special documents by a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie and irrefragable consecution. First, that the second booke of the Machabees is not Canonical, or penned by the holie ghost. For if that booke vvere of canonicall authoritie, vvhich the papistes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1677:11"/>
purgatorie could not but haue bene knovven, so soon as that booke vvas knovvn, vvhich yet Roffensis denieth. The reason is evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause purgatorie is verie effectuallie &amp; plainlie conteined therin.</p>
               <p>Secondlie, that the Church of Rome (for of that church speaketh the Bishop) reputeth the vvorkes of God vnperfect, albeit Moyses avoucheth the contrarie. <hi>Dei, inquit, perfecta sunt opera.</hi> The vvorkes <note place="margin">Deut. cap. 2. vers. 4.</note> of God, saith he, are perfect. I prooue this, because as the Bishop saith, the scriptures made purgatorie knovven to the church, but vnperfectlie: yet the truth is, that if God make purgatorie knovven by the scriptures, then purgatorie is made knovven perfectlie by them, or else Gods vvorks, that is, the holie scriptures, must be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect. but I vvil rather beleeue Moyses the holie prophet of God, then my lord our fisher, though the popes canonized martir.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie, this Bishop for this his doctrine, must either come againe to retract his opinion, or else wil he nil he, condemne the pope and church of Rome. This I wil proove, by a most plaine and evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration. For the better vnderstanding vvherof, I shal desire the gentle reader to observe three thinges vvith me.</p>
               <p>First, that the church of Rome preacheth novv and did in this Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops time, that the bookes of Machabees are canonicall scripture, and penned by the holie ghost.</p>
               <p>Secondlie, that the church of Rome neither beleeued nor knevv purgatorie, for manie years together after the receite of holie scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and these bookes of Machabees.</p>
               <p>Thirdlie, that purgatorie is effectuallie and plainely conteined in the second booke of Machabees by popish estimation, in that their Latine vulgata edition, vvhich their tridentine councell hath most straitlie charged all chistendome to observe, as all papistes now a daies repute the same a stable bulwarke for their purgatorie. the wordes are these: <hi>sancta ergo &amp; salubris est cogitatio pro defunctis exorare, vt à peccatis solvantur,</hi> it is therefore a good and godlie consideration <note place="margin">2. Machab. cap. 12. vers. 26.</note> to pray for the dead, that they may bee cleansed from their sinnes. these wordes are so plaine and so easie, as not onelie the vvhole church, but my lord Bishop, yea and euerie scholer that but mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie knoweth the latine tongue, must needes vnderstand the same. And consequentlie must needes knovv purgatorie by them, if hee can vse anie discourse at all, as my lord of Rochester could doe right well. vpon these observations then I inferre first, that the church of Rome not knowing purgatorie for manie yeares, after she had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the scriptures, in which purgatorie was so plainlie and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie conteined as they now graunt, did not repute the bookes of Machabees for canonicall scriptures, and consequentlie did not beleeue purgatorie mentioned therein. For this indeed is most true, of the old and good church of Rome, as Roffensis hath proved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1677:12"/>
his vvill.</p>
               <p>I inferre secondlie, that the church of God never had or can haue other scriptures or other faith, then the apostles had, and beleeved in their time. For the latter church neuer had nor ever shall haue authoritie, to coine anie new scriptures or nevv faith. The church of Rome therefore taught most wicked doctrine in my <hi>L.</hi> Bishops time, vvhich he well perceiued and acknowledged in his ovvne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, or els was in that point infatuated &amp; become a verie foole, according to this saying of the Gospel,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Confiteor tibi pater domine coeli &amp; terrae, quia abscondisti haec à sapienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Matt. cap. 11. vers. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp; prudentibus, &amp; revelasti ea parvulis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I giue thee thankes, O Father Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and men of vnderstanding, and reuealed them vnto babes.</p>

               <p>ALbeit the papistes doe reproue others bitterlie, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect some authotities, though vpon important and grounded reasons, yet themselves with all libertie reiect &amp; contemne authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at their pleasures. They reiect the fourth booke of Esaias, as <note place="margin">Bellar. lib. 1. de verbo dei. cap. 4.</note> Bellarminus confesseth. They reiect the last clause of the Lords prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as Arius Montanus witnesseth. They reiect the 65. canon of the Apostles, as graunteth Bellarminus in these wordes: <hi>Respondeo cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Aries Montanus in cap. 6. Matt. Bellar. lib. 2. de Rom. Pont. cap. 27.</note> 
                  <hi>istum supposititium videri, solum. n. quinquaginta canones apostolorum ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia recipit.</hi> I answere that this canon is a counterfaite, for the church (of Rome) receiveth onelie 50. canons of the apostles. Marke gentle reader, that this canon reproveth the practise of the Church of Rome, and so the church, <hi>si dijs placet,</hi> will not receiue it. They reiect the sixt generall councell, because forsooth it prescribeth li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits to the bishop of Rome, and denieth his vsurped iurisdiction. That they reiect this solemne and vniuersall councel, Bellarminus auoucheth stoutlie: but pope Adrian reputed a most graue vvriter by the learned papists, received and reverenced the said councell. <note place="margin">Bellar. vbi sup.</note> for these are his vvords, cited in their ovvne canon lavve: <hi>Sextam synodum sancta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cum om nibus canonibus suis recipio.</hi> I receiue the sixt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie <note place="margin">Dist. 16. cap. 6.</note> synode, vvith all the canons thereof. Loe, the Pope himselfe and their ovvne canon lavv, confirme this councel to be of good auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Reade the next chapter in the said canon lavy, for there is large matter vttered for the approbation, of the same. They reiect that part of the councell of Constance, vvhich Pope Martin vvould not allovv. And vvhy vvould not hee allovv that part, as vvell as he approued the other parts? because for sooth it denieth the Popes authoritie, to be aboue the councel. but because I vvill not rip vp <note place="margin">Bellar. lib. 2. de conciliis, cap. 19.</note>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1677:12"/>
popish licentious libertie to the bottome, I vvill rest vvith recitall of that onelie libertie, vvhich Bellarminus vseth in defense of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish masse: these are his vvordes; <hi>Porro epistolae duae quae circumferun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Bellar. lib. 2. de Missa. cap. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>de hac re, Damasi ad Hieronymum &amp; Hieronymi ad Damasum, supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titiae sunt.</hi> Furthermore the tvvo epistles vvhich are carried about, of Damasus to Hierome, and of Hierome to Damasus, are counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faite. But the absurdest Epistles, Canons, and vvritinges that euer vvere or can be, are verie authentical vvith them, and most currant, so they make for our holie father the pope his vsurped iurisdiction. For proofe of this point, I vvil content my selfe vvith tvvo examples for brevitie sake. For by them and the disproofe thereof, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may haue a sufficient coniecture of the rest. The former exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <note place="margin">Epist. 1. Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis ad Jacobum fratrem dom. 1. concil.</note> is taken out of S. Clements epistle to S. Iames. in this and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther epistles follovving put forth in the name of S. Clement, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended vnto vs, auricular confession, the sacrifice of the masse, the subiection of kinges to bishops, the primacie of S. Peter and such like, for vvhich respectes the said epistles are currant and authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call amongst the papistes. but <hi>magna est veritas &amp; praevalet,</hi> great is <note place="margin">3. Esd. cap. 4. vers. 42.</note> the truth and it preuaileth, for the verie vvordes of the epistle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray and bevvray the same, and make it manifest vnto all the world, that it is a counterfait. These therefore are the vvordes: <hi>Clemens Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobo domino, episcopo episcoporum regenti Hebraeorum sanctam ecclesiam Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosolymis, sed &amp; omnes ecclesias quae vbique Dei provide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tia fundatae sunt, cum patribus &amp; diaconibus, &amp; caeteris omnibus patribus, pax tibi sit semper.</hi> Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to lord Iames the bishop of bishops, that governeth the holy church of the Hebrevves at Hierusalem, as also that governeth all churches founded by Gods provide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce throughout the vvorld, vvith the fathers and deacons, and all other fathers, peace be to thee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvaie. Novv gentle reader thou hast heard the vvords, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdest no doubt the vanitie thereof: for if S. Iames vvere not only bishop of Hierusalem, but the bishop of bishops, and the governor of all Churches in the christian vvorld, as this epistle affirmeth; then doubtles vvas S. Iames the pope and supreme head of the church, &amp; not S. Peter; and yet doth the selfe same epistle avouch, that S. Peter vvas the head of the church, and that S. Peter lying sicke in his bed called <hi>S.</hi> Clement vnto him, and told him that his houre of death vvas at hand, and that therefore he appointed the said Clement to be his successour, and to sit in his chaire at Rome. But S. Iames suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Christ himselfe at Hierusalem, vvho vvas indeede the head of holie Church: and therefore S. Iames should rather be Pope then S. Clement, if there vvere indeed anie such pope at all. the latter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample is taken out of that vvorke vvhich is fathered vpon S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine, of true and false repentance. vvhich booke, because it seemeth to approove confession of sinnes to priests, is good and authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1677:13"/>
vvith papistes; but as God vvould haue it, the selfe same booke confuteth it selfe so plainlie, as none vvith reason can esteeme it worth a straw. For in that verie booke the author thereof (who so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer <note place="margin">Aug. dever. &amp; fals. poenit. cap. 17.</note> he were) alleageth S. Austens opinion, and confuteth the same. These are the wordes: <hi>quod quam vis licet de eius salute Augustinus po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit dubitare, credo quidemilli qui dixit; quacunque hora peccator ingemue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, &amp; conversus fuerit, vita viuet.</hi> because although S. Augustine doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his saluation, yet do I beleeue him that said: at what houre <note place="margin">Ezech. 33.</note> soeuer a sinner shall repent and be converted, hee shall live. These are the wordes of this vvriter, which doubtlesse cannot be S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines, because S. Austen would never speake of him selfe as of a strange third person, and purposelie confute himselfe, as this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor confuteth Augustine. Besides this, S. Augustine in his bookes of confession doth vtterlie condemne confession of sinnes vnto Priestes, as I haue prooved in the chapter of auricular confession, but alas, the Papistes as they haue but one onelie place of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabees for their forged pugatorie, so haue they but onelie this place of S. Augustine for their popish confession. And therefore no marveile if they invent poore &amp; miserable shifts, to have them both reputed authentical if it would be.</p>

               <p>THe cheefest and principall thing that seduceth and maketh so manie wilfull papistes, is this (gentle reader) for certaintie. when so ever anie one of what degree, calling, or condition soever, shall become a papist and yeeld himselfe to the slanedome of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish religion, that person must bye and bye prosesse ipso facto, to beleeue and imbrace all the popes decrees of faith and maners, as the verie selfe decrees of the holie ghost, and also to obey his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and censures, as the lawes of God and not of man: their reason whereof is, because as they say, the holie Ghost doth so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, couduct, and guide the Popes tongue and pen, that he can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther define, commaund, or write anie thing in iudiciall and difini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue maner, but it must perforce proceed from the holie ghost: out of which falslie supposed ground, two most pernicious euils follow of necessitie. The one, that whensoeuer anie difficultie, doubt, or controversie ariseth about anie matter of religion, then by and by the Papistes consider first of all what the pope holdeth (whether it be in the decrees, decretals, the sixt booke, Clementines, extravagants) and that done, they will coine one distinction or other, by which they vvill racke the meaning of the question, difficultie, reason, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or scripture propounded, to agree with that which the pope holdeth. For they wil neuer examine the popes decrees by the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1677:13"/>
fathers or cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cels: but the fathers, or councels, &amp; scriptures, <note place="margin">See the 13. orticle of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sention, cap. 8. and the words of Couarru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vias in the 5. chap. &amp; 1. con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>clusion.</note> by the Popes faith, constitutions, &amp; practise. for if anie can once say, the Church, that is, the pope holdeth so, then is the controversie at an end, he shall be demed an heretike that proceedeth one iot further. for their canon law hath made it sacriledge, to dispute, of the popes power. Read the first chapter. the other, that none may or dare reade, either the scriptures tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>slated into their vulgar tongue, or any expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitours vpon the latine Bible, or anie booke of controversies, or anie writer whosoeuer in anie matter of religion, popish writers onelie excepted, vnlesse they first haue a licence from the pope: which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense is neuer graunted, but to special persons &amp; vpon speciall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations. And out of this sharpe, vnchristian, and diabolical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, issueth the third euill; to wit, that not one papist among ten thousand knoweth anie thing perteining to religion, save onely a few special pointes of popish doctrine. For they are taught, that to beleeve as the fable of the Colier teacheth them, is sufficient: the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil as cardinall Hosius reporteth, disputed with a poore colier, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him how he beleeved, I beleeue, said the colier, as the church beleeueth: then the deuill demaunding how the Church beleeued, the colier answered in this maner: I beleeue as the church beleeueth, and the church beleeueth as I beleeue, &amp; there he rested, and would not remoue one iote. At the same stay are all papistes this day, who beleeue as the church of Rome beleeueth, though they cannot tell how it beleeueth, but onelie in a generall and grosse maner, and so they often times beleeue they know not what. Marrie our English papistes for feare of the statute, dare not stand vpon this beleefe, (though it be their staie indeed,) but flee to another bulwarke as they deeme it, to wit, it is against my conscience, when yet in verie deede, they can no more tell what conscience is, then they know what the romish church beleeveth.</p>

               <p>THe religion this day established by godlie lawes in this realme of England, is the auncie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, christian, catholike, and apostolike doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which was taught by Christ and his apostles, practised in the primitive church, &amp; euer continued in the heartes of the faithfull vntill this houre, and shal no doubt to the worlds end. And though the common people for the greater part, call it the new religion: yet is that a meere childish vanitie, and the popish doctrine the new religion in verie deed. For the old Romish religion, is this day hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and observed in this Realme. which thing is proued at large, <note place="margin">These Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chenes are yet in Rome.</note> throughout my second booke: for example, the profession of the romish Capuchenes is not a new profession in religion, but the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1677:14"/>
old franciscan profession newlie reformed: and therefore doe they terme themselues the reformed franciscanes, which yet the other corrupt, and dissolute franciscans will not acknowlege, and euen so in our case, the religion now established in England, is not a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on opposite to the first old Romish religion, but the old Romish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion newlie reformed, and purged from the corruptions and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses crept into the same. From which auncient and pure religion the pope and his adherents are departed, like as the franciscans are also gone from their old popish franciscan profession.</p>

               <p>THe ignorant papistes (that is, all papistes or verie few excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) doe greatlie loth and abhorre the christian catholike reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, now established in this land by godlie lawes in a godlie maner.

And that this is the faith and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1677:14"/>
doctrine of the Church of England verie manie God be thanked for it, haue left to their posteritie livelie testimonies of the same: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I will onelie name one, who as hee did inwardlie in his heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the gospell, so did he outwardlie in his life professe it, and after his death confirme the same, with a most charitable and christian te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of immortall memorie. I speake of that honourable and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous christian Sir VValter Mildmey, the late fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der of a most famous colledge in the vniuersitie of Cambridge, which he tearmed not after his owne name (as the greater part vseth,) but Emanuell, that is, God with vs: giuing vs to vnderstand therby, that as hee beleeued and loued God, so he would testify the same to al posterities by that, worthie act, as by the effect and fruite of a liuelie faith. Now then how doe we differ from the papistes herein? Zanchius shall answere. <hi>Atque hic est vnus ex praecipuis vsibus bonorumoperum, quod ijs non tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam</hi>

But the papistes will say: if good woorkes cannot merite glorie nor iustifie: wherefore then must we do them? I answere, that we must liue well and doe good workes, for the loue and dutie we owe to God, and because so is his holie will and good pleasure. so saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, in these words, <hi>ipsius enim sumus factura, creati in Christo Iesu in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peribus bonis, quae preparavit Deus vt in illis ambulemus.</hi> for wee are his workemanship created in Christ Iesus vnto good workes, which God hath ordained that we should walke in them. so then, we thinke as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerentlie and esteem as worthilie of good works, as doth anie papist in the world. for we grant that none can be saued or sanctified with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good workes: and further, that none is truelie iustified which hath not good works: &amp; yet for all that do we constantly affirme, and that by the authoritie of holie writte, that no man is or can be iustify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by vertue of his good works: &amp; the error of the Papistes consisteth in this, that they do not distinguish betweene sanctification and iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. the truth of our doctrine (which is the verity grounded in the sacred scriptures,) is this, that sanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; iustificatió, are inseparably vnited in one &amp; the same subiect, <hi>in eode<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> instanti tëporis no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae,</hi> as the scholes speake, that is: we are freelie iustified &amp; sanctifyed also in the same insta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of time, but first iustified in prioritie of nature: for example, fire and the heate are both at one and the same time, though fire be before in prioritie of nature: that is, though fire goe before: as the cause of euerie thing is before the effect of the same, and as fire is not before heate in time, and yet the cause of that heate, so is our iustification not before our sanctification, or our inherent
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1677:15"/>
iustice in time, and yet is it the cause of our sanctification, of our inherent iustice, and of all the good workes we doe: which thing if the papistes would once seriouslie observe, they would not differ from our opinion in this behalfe, vnlesse they haue fullie resolved, to oppose themselves desperatlie against the truth.</p>

               <p>VVHo so euer will but euen superficiallie consider the vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie of popish doctrine, shall thereby without further discourse find svfficient matter to abhorre and detest the same, as most friuolous, most ridiculous, most irreligious. For example, in the sacrament of the altar as they terme it: if certaine questions be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded vnto them, the best learned know not what to answere, but so simply and so sottishly, as euerie child may espie the follie of their doctrine. If anie papist can truely and without blushing say the contrarie, let the same be notifyed by his ansvvere, to these my briefe demaundes. 1. First, I demaund how they excuse the people that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore with diuine worship, the thing eleuated ouer the priestes head at Masse, from idolatrie, from heresie, from false beleefe. For if either the Priest want intention to consecrate (vvhich often chaunceth by reason of vvandering imaginations,) or of purpose meaneth not to consecrate, or of negligence omitteth any vvord of consecration, then by popish religion the thing adored, is but pure bread, &amp; so the adorers thereof become idolaters, vvorshipping a peece of bread for <note place="margin">Cap. dubium de haeret. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarr. cap. 11. parag. 18. Barthol. fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus de hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res. parag, 17.</note> the euerliuing God. And if the people either refuse to adore, or doubt if they may adore, they are deemed heretiques <hi>ipso facto</hi> for their pains, because as the Popes disholie canons tell vs, he that but doubteth of Romish definitions, concerning faith and maners, is an heretike.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Secondlie, I demaund what it is that the priest receiueth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuereth to the communicants, when he hauing 40. breads before him, supposeth them to be but 38. or 39. and so intendeth to consecrate no more? for beyond the priestes intention, consecration cannot extend, as all wise Papistes graunt, neither is his intention more limited to one bread then to an other, and therfore can no more consecrate one bread then another.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thirdlie, I demaund which part of the host as they terme it, is the popish made God, when the sacrificer intendeth indefinitelie to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate the one halfe of the said host, and how there in adoring they can avoid idolatrie.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Fourthly, I demaund howe many gods, or how many times God is made in one and the same hoste, in and at that Masse, when all the newly made priestes doe consecrate, in their Romish Church Lathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran? for they are all appointed to consecrate, they doe all pronounce the wordes, they are all bounden to have intention, and yet when the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall author, to wit, the Bishop, is at the last sillable, some of the rest be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1677:15"/>
in the middest, some in the beginning, some in one place, some in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, never a one jumping with other in that instant, in which they should their bread-god make: for of this matter are three solemne dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonant opinions, amongest the great Romish Rabbins. Pope Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius <note place="margin">Iosephus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, in 4. s. q. 7. de Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist. 8. diffic.</note> holdeth, that all doe consecrate: Durandus avowcheth that that Priest onely consecratetth, which with greatest speed first commeth to the end: but Cardinall Caietan hath another consideration.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Fifthly, I demaund concerning their wordes of consecration, what is in the priestes hand when he hath uttered all the wordes save one? if they answere the bodie of Christ, then doeth it followe, that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall worde of their consecration is needlesse, that their wordes of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration be uncerten, and that their consecratorie wordes so called, be not causative of their falsly supposed effect: if they say it is pure bread, or bread in substance but altered in qualitie, then doeth it followe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily, that the consecration consisteth of the last word onely, and that all the rest are meere extrinsecall to their imagined transubstantiation: if they say it is neither Christes bodie, nor bread, but an unknowen sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, or as they tearme it sometime, <hi>individuum vagum,</hi> we may truely tell them, that their certentie of their idolatrous sacrament, is as uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as the weather-cocke.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Sixtly, I demaund of them how Christes natural bodie being large, is contained in around cake being little, since Christes bodie is a true organicall bodie, which hath divers partes every one distant from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: if they say that Christes bodie is there without dimensions, their owne angelicall, and famous Doctor Aquinas is against them: if they say, that though it can not be so by naturall power, yet can God miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously <note place="margin">Aquinas. p. 3. q. 76. art. 4.</note> bring so much to passe: to that I answere, that so to say can not serve their turne, for by the confession of all learned men, yea, even of all popish schoole-men and Doctors, there be many things which God can not doe, or rather many things which can no way be done: for example, God can not sinne, God can not make time past not to be past, God can not make that a blind man remaining blinde, do not want his sight, though he can give sight to the blind: God can not make that a dead man remaining dead, have life, though he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store life to the dead: in fine, God can do nothing that implyeth contradiction: and yet doeth not this want of doing argue impoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in God, who is omnipotent; but defect in the thing that should be done. Nowe so it is, that this imagined being of Christes body in a little round cake implyeth in it selfe contradiction, &amp; consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, can not possibly be done. For example, no power can bring to passe, that a bodie being sixe cubits long, and two cubits broad, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining still so long and broad, shall be contained in another body, being onely three cubits long, and one cubite broad: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hereof is, because so to conteine, and be conteined, implyeth
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1677:16"/>
contradiction. And this is the case novv put, of Christes bodie in the round popish cake. Let all the papistes in England or els where solve this reason, and I will be their bondman. And if they can not solve it, (which indeede is impossible to be done,) then must they perforce confesse vvhich they vvould not, that their doctrine is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous, impossible, and execrable.</p>
               <p>Seventhlie, I demaund hovv they can defend Christes bodie from being broken and devided, when they breake and devide their round cakes, since by their doctrine Christes bodie is reallie conteined in the same?</p>
               <p>Eightly, I demaund hovv they can distinguish division of the bread from consecration of the same, or hovv they can denie it to be of equall force vvith consecration thereof? for by consecration of one bread, Christes bodie is but in one place: but by division of one bread, his bodie is locallie in manie places at once.</p>

               <p>The Donatistes are to to vnquiet, and therefore I thinke it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient, that they be restreined and corrected by povvers ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God. for wee alreadie haue ioy of manie, by reason of their correction, who keepe and defend catholike vnitie so sincerely, and <note place="margin">A point wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie to be wel considered, as which greatly respecteth our case in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</note> so reioise, that they are deliuered from their olde errour, as wee with great congratulation doe admire them vvho for all that I know not by what force of custome, would never once thinke of reforming them selues, but onelie through this feare and terrour. My former opinion vvas, that none should be constrained to christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an vnitie, that vve should strive with the word, contend with dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and ouercome vvith reason: least vvee should have them counterfait catholikes, whom vvee had knovven to be open here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes.

For first of al mine ovvne citie vvas obiected vnto mee, vvhich standing vvhollie vpon Donatistes, vvas for all that brought to catholike vnitie, by sharpe imperiall lavves. Thus farre S. Augustine.</p>
               <p>The other thing is a point of so great importance, as none can be more. for if it vvere true, as the papistes vvith tooth and naile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch it to be, then vvere all other religions false, &amp; theirs onely true: for there is but one God, one faith, one baptisme, one reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; yet if it be false, as false it is indeede, (vvhich by the povver of God I shall prooue by euident demonstration, and that euen by the testimonies of the best learned popish doctours:) then must their religion of necessitie be naught, hovv soeuer others be. this great and vveightie point is, that the Pope can not erre in his definitive sentence, vvhether he define concerning faith or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. For (say they) Christ committed his church to saint Peter, praying that his faith should neuer faile: and consequentlie, hee prayed that the Pope as Pope should never erre, because the Pope is Saint Peters successour, and Christes vicar generall vpon earth. I say, the pope as pope vvith reduplication in vvay of my sincere

dealing with the papistes, because by the vniforme consent of all learned papistes Albertus Pighius onely excepted: the Pope in his owne private person may be a Iudas, a fornicator, a simonist, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide, an vsurer, an atheist, an heretike: and for his manifold ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities be damned into hell. that this is the doctrine of all papistes, as well concerning the popes priuate person, as touching his iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall definitions, is confessed by Robertus Bellarminus, Bartho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomeus Carranza, Melchior Cauus, Dominicus Soto, Thomas A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas, Antoninus, Caietanus, Covarruvias, and others: but that the pope as pope and publique person can erre, that all the saide papistes vvith their complices constantlie denie: as which one on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie point once cofeffed, would vtterlie confound them, and make frustrate their vvhole religion. For in all difficulties, doubtes, and distresses, the papistes haue euer recourse vnto this point, as vnto the diuine oracle of great god Apollo: that is to say, the church of Rome teacheth soe: ergo we must beleeue so. This point, as it <note place="margin">God grant that others may perceiue it, as I haue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</note> maketh manie others to be papistes, so made it my selfe one, and kept me one, vntill by Gods holie inspiration, I perceiued the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surditie thereof.

                  <head>The first Conclusion.</head>
                  <p>THe popes pardons are too too foolish, as which are repugnant to common sense and reason. My proofe standeth thus: all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxations beeing larger then any man liuing or dead doth or can need, are too too foolish, but the popes pardons are such: ergo the popes pardons are to to foolish. The consequence is good, and the consequent directly and truelie inferred vpon the premisses, as which is <hi>in prima figura,</hi> and <hi>modo darij,</hi> as the Logicians terme it: the proposition is so euident, as none can or will denie the same: so the difficultie resteth onely in the assumption, vvhich I proue three seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall waies.</p>
                  <p>First, by the huge and infinite numbers of pardons, hanged vp in pardoning tables at the pillars of euerie church for the most part in Rome. which not onelie my selfe haue seene and read, but manie thousand besides me.</p>
                  <p>Secondlie, by pardons conteining manie thousand yeares, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely set downe in olde English primars: vvhereof the papistes seeme novv at length so ashamed, that the like is not to be found in the nevv tridentine primars.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, by a litle pamphlet of the marueilous things of Rome, which is commonlie to be sold euerie where, one of vvhich I brought from thence my selfe, and haue at this houre. For in all these three, pardons are graunted prodigallie, (I would say charitably,) for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie thousands of yeares. yea, in the litle romish pamphlet to omitte other churches, are graunted euerie day to <hi>S:</hi> Iohn Euangelistes church, 6048. yeares of pardon. Novv, least any be so sottish as to imagine; that a man can neede so manie yeares of pardon: that I vvill disprooue sundrie vvaies.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 Secondlie, because no man can abide so long in purgatorie. And least some papist replie, and say, that one may be so long in purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, I vvill prove mine assertion by the best popish doctors.

                  <p>THe vertue and efficacie of Popes pardons is so vncertaine and doubtfull, and that euen amongest the greatest popish doctors: as themselves can not tel, vvhat in the vvorld to say or thinke ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. This conclusion I proue thus: Angelus de Clauasio a famous ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonist and religious Frier, reciteth 6. severall and dissonant opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">Angelus de indulgentia.</note> concerning the vertue of pardons, and after hee hath confuted them all, he setteth dovvne the seaventh for his ovvne, and the best, vvhich as hee sayth is true, it is therefore no doubt substantiall, as shortlie shall bee seene. The first opinion (saith our holie Frier,) holdeth that the Popes pardons onely remit that punishment,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1677:19"/>
which God appointeth to be imposed in another worlde, for a supplie unto those, who have done penance onely according to the Canons, but doeth in no case remit that penance, which is imposed and taxed by the Canons. The second opinion holdeth, that the Pardons onely forgive that penance, which is taxed by the law and penitentiall Canons; but not that paine, which Gods justice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointeth to be imposed. The third opinion holdeth, that Pardons forgive paine due for sinne, aswell before God as before his Church: but this opinion addeth a clause so sharpe, as our holy Father doeth not brooke it, to wit, that the Pope is bound to do penance, for that person whome he pardoneth. The fourth opinion holdeth, that the paine of hell is partly remitted by the Popes pardons, as which becommeth thereby more tollerable. The fift opinion holdeth, that that penance onely is pardoned, which the partie omitted of negligence, not of purpose or contempt. The sixt opinion holdeth, that the Popes pardons remit not onely pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance imposed by the Priest, but that also which is taxed of God: marrie this opinion hath one limitation, which forsooth is this: that the Priest must be content therewith, or else the Pope can not worke his will. The seventh opinion holdeth, that Popish pardons forgive, and are woorth so much, as the wordes of the Pardons do sound: that is to say, if the Pardons containe an hundred thousand yeeres, then the partie obteining such pardons at the Popes handes, must have remission of so many yeeres. Thus gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der standeth the doctrine of Popish pardons, amongst the greatest Doctors of that faction. He that listeth to peruse the place quoted by me out of Angelus, shall finde every thing as I have set it downe. The rehearsall of the varietie and uncertaintie of these opinions, is a most sufficient confutation of the same. Sylvester Prieras a great <note place="margin">Sylvester de indulgent.</note> Thomist, and sometime Master of the sacred pallace, reciteth three severall opinions, and disliking them all, setteth downe the fourth for the trueth. Antoninus sometime the Arch-bishop of Florence, alledgeth three opinions, and scarce knoweth which of them he should preferre. Bellarminus in his written disputations abridged by Robert Persons his brother Iesuite, defendeth and approoveth another opinion plaine opposite to all yet rehearsed, and maketh in deede the Popes pardons not woorth a button: which is the cause (as I probably coniecture,) that the third and last part of his disputations, is not permitted as yet to come abroade: and either will never be published, or wholly omitted, or at least changed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it come abroad. The Councell of Trent speaketh very slender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and coldly, of the Popes pardons.</p>

                  <head>The third Conclusion.</head>
                  <p>TO give pardons as the Pope doeth, is a straunge and newe doctrine of a most damnable Religion, which neither Christ nor his Apostles ever taught or practised. This I will proove, as I doe other things, by the expresse testimonies of the Popes owne renowmed Doctors: that so all the worlde may perceive and beholde, Papistrie confuted and confounded, by papistrie it selfe. Sylvester reputed, and as it were surnamed absolutus Theologus, hath these verie wordes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Indulgentia nobis per Scripturam minimè innotuit, licet induca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur illud Apostoli, (si quid donavi vobis,) sednec per dicta antiquorum</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Sylvester de indulg.</note> 
                     <hi>Doctorum, sed modernorum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Popes pardons (saith the Popes owne deare Doctor,) were never knowen to us by the Scriptures, although some alleadge Saint Paul for that purpose: neither were they knowen by the auncient Fathers, but onely by late writers. Antoninus in his first part hath the verie wordes alreadie cited, and holdeth the selfe same opinion with fryer Sylvester. Petrus Lombardus, who with great diligence collected into one volume, all worthie sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the auncient fathers: and therefore was surnamed the Master of sentences, maketh no mention of the Popes pardons at all; as which he could not finde, notwithstanding his painefull <note place="margin">Antoninus part. 1. rit. 10. cap. 3. Lombardus: could not find the Popes pardons in the holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note> industrie imployed in that kinde of exercise. For as Sylvester tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly writeth, the olde writers were not acquainted with any such thing. The like may be said of S, Cyprian, S. Augustine, S. Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome, Nazianzene, and others of antiquitie: for which cause Durand, Caietain, and sundrie other schoolemen, affirme the popes manner of pardoning, to be a newe thing in the Church of God. Neither can Dominicus Soto deny the same indeede, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he busieth him selfe more then a little, in the Popes defence if it would be. Yea, the originall of popish pardoning is so very young, as their famous martyr and bishop, M. Fisher in his aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to M. Luthers articles: was enforced to admit the newnesse and young age of the same, and to yeeld this reason in defence <note place="margin">Soto in 4. sent. dist. 21. quaest. 1. art. 3. Roffensis contra artic. Luther.</note> thereof: to wit, that purgatorie was not so well knowne at that time to the Church, as it is nowe. which saying I weene is true indeede, because purgatorie and pardous were not heard of in olde time, and nowe onely knowen by vaine, grosse, and sensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all imaginations. O worthie pardons? O brave purgatorie? O holy pope of Rome? what stronge reasons, what forcible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, what grave authorities, are alleadged in your behalfe?
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1677:20"/>
Let us heare with attention the finall resolution hereof, set down by Sylvester and Antoninus for their holy father the pope.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quia inquiunt, Ecclesia hoc facit &amp; servat, credendum est ita esse.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Sylvester &amp; Antoninus ubi supra.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Because the Church this doeth, and thus observeth, we must beleeve that it is so. Loe, a short and sweete conclusion: as if they should say, though we can proove the popes pardons, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by Scriptures, nor by fathers, nor by reasons, yet must we beleeve them, because the Church, that is, the pope saith so, who can not erre: which saying, (gentle Reader,) both hath bene, and is, the sole and onely foundation of all notorious Papistry.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE Popes manner of pardoning, argueth aswell inordinate affection of filthie lucre, as also want of charitie. His want of charitie is prooved, and convinced, in that he can deliver (as his religion teacheth,) all soules out of purgatorie with his word: and neverthelesse suffereth them to abide most bitter torments, so many yeeres in that affliction. For the papistes holde, that the paines of purgatorie are as great and painefull, as be the torments of hell: and that they differ accidentally in this only, because the paines of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie shall once have an ende, but the paines of hell, never. Thus writeth Sylvester Prieras.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sicut potest (Papa) liberare à poena peccatorum debita in hoc mundo</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Sylvester ubi supr. Par. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>omnes qui sunt in mundo, si faciant quod mandat, etiamsi essent mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies plures quàm sunt: it a liberare potest omnes qui sunt in purgatorio, siquis pro eis faciat quod iubet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As the Pope can deliver al in this world, from paine due for sinne in this world, if they doe that which he appointeth, though they were thousands more then they be: even so can he deliver all that are in purgatorie, if any doe that for them which he commandeth: and lest any man should thinke that impossible, or a verie difficult matter, which the Pope requireth to be done: Sylvester in another place tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth us, that it is a thing most easie. These be his wordes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Indulgentiae simplicitèr tantum valent, quantum praedicantur,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Sylvester ubi supr. Par. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>modò exparte dantis sit autoritas, ex parte recipientis charitas, &amp; ex parte causae pietas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Pardons are simply worth so much as they are preached, so there be autoritie in the giver, charity in the receiver, &amp; piety in the cause or motive. But so it is, that the souls in purgatory be in charity by popish confession, for else they could not be out of hel: and that the pope hath
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1677:21"/>
authoritie, as also that he graunteth his Pardons for good and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly causes, I suppose no Papist will denie: if they doe, my argument is the stronger, and my selfe shall easily agree there to. Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeus Fumus confirmeth this point, when he thus writeth. <note place="margin">Barthol. Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus de Papa. Par. 11.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Papa posset liberare omnes animas Purgatorij, etiamsiplures essent, si quis pro eis faceret quod iuberet, peccaret tamen indiscretè conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Pope could set at libertie all the soules of Purgatorie though never so many, if any would doe that for them which he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: marrie he should sinne by his undiscreete pardoning. And the popish schole-doctor Viguerius proceedeth further, and avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth it to be neither inconvenient, nor against the justice of God: these are his expresse wordes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nec est inconveniens quòd Papa Purgatorium posset evacuare, non enim per hoc aliquid detraheretur Divinae iustitiae.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Viguerius de Sacrament. ordinis in fine.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither is it inconvenient that the Pope can harrowe hell, for that doeth nothing derogate from the iustice of God. Nowe to say that he can this doe, but yet doeth it not, to keepe him selfe from sinne: is altogether vaine and frivolous. For first, he should no more sinne in delivering all, then he doeth in setting one onely at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as is alreadie prooved by Sylvester and Viguerius. Againe, ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie Pardons are so common at the houre of death, as none that either have friendes or money, are or can be destitute thereof: which yet is a poynt more undiscreete then the other, by their owne doctrine. Thirdly, the three condicions required for the legitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Popish Pardoning, concurre as sweetely in delivering all to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ioyntly, as in delivering one by one severallie. His inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate affection of lucre is convinced in this, that albeit he can with one onely pardon set open the gates of Purgatorie, and so set all the prisoners at libertie: yet will he not extend that compassion to them, but taketh this course with them, that they shall appoint Pia Legata by their last willes and testaments, for Masses, Diriges, and Trentals to be said yeerely, or rather perpetually, (if their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie will extend so farre:) with which Masses, Diriges, and Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, his pardons shall concurre, and so deliver them by discretion. By reason of which ungodly pollicie, we may this day behold with our eyes, so many altars erected, so many Churches sumptuouslie decked, so many Priestes richly maintained, especially in Saint Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories Church at Rome. For which Masses, Diriges, and Trentals, huge summes of money are given, daily, yeerely, perpetually, not for the Masses formallie concedo, but yet formally for the Priestes paines, and materially for the Masses, constanter assero.</p>

                     <hi>The</hi> 5 <hi>Conclusion.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE foundation of the Popes pardons is wicked, blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and derogatorie to the most pretious blood of Christ, shed for mans redemption. This is the proofe of this conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: the Pope and many of his popish Doctors tell us, that the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation <note place="margin">Sylvester de indulg. Pat 4. Soto in 4. sent. dist. &amp; art. 2.</note> of their popish pardons is this, <hi>Thesaurus meritorum Christi, &amp; Sanctorum eius:</hi> the treasure of the merites of Christ, and of his Saintes. For say they, not onely Christ, but many of his Saintes also, suffered much more then was due for their owne sinnes: which workes of supererogation or satisfactions, they call the treasure of the Church: and because (say they,) Gods Saintes did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie those their superaboundant passions to this or that person, the Pope therefore must make application thereof at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, as one that hath Christes full authoritie, or <hi>plenitudinem po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testatis,</hi> being his Vicar generall upon earth. And here note by the way (gentle Reader,) that for the execution of this Vicars office, there be ever in Rome two Vicars generall, and one sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute Vicar, whereof two neither preach, teach, or execute any priestly function usuallie: but the poore substitute, must doe all that is done. So in my time, Gregorie the foureteenth was Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car generall to Christ, <hi>si dijs placet,</hi> Cardinall Sabello Vicar-gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall to Gregorie, and our Goldwell, sometime Bishoppe of Saint Assaph, substitute to Sabello: which poore Bishoppe tooke all the paine, and had the least gaine. For it is not the usuall maner of Popes and Cardinals in these latter dayes, to say Masse, to preach, to teach, and so foorth, <hi>(I</hi> speake of Cardinals resiant at Rome,) but to joyne living to living, benefice to benefice, promoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Here would I learne, why the Queenes Mai estie may not employ Abbeyes to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the whole Realm, with suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of abuses: as well as the Pope may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow the same, upon irreligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and idle Cardinals.</note> to promotion, and which is more absurd in their owne religion, to be so lordly Abbots, or rather so idle Lubbards, that they will take and snatch all the commodities of the whole Abbeyes unto themselves, and neither graunt sufficient foode and rayment for the Monkes, nor competent allovvance for the necessarie mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the house it selfe, for their Masse, Mattins, and service: Such is their charitie to their neighbors, zeale to their office, &amp; reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their own religion. This is also true, as if any Papist wil deny the same, his owne breath will witnesse against him. For to omit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, S. Laurence and S. Pancratius their Abbeyes and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are so poore and beggerly (through the pilling and polling of Cardinals their Abbots,) that when priestes come thither to say Masse, (as the usuall manner there is,) they can neither finde wine nor candles without money: which default when any one obiecteth as a disgrace to their profession and Religion, the poore
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1677:22"/>
Monkes answere in this manner; Alas, we can not doe withall, my L. Cardinall hath all the living, and alloweth us a small portion, not able to fill our bellyes. But to leave this digression, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the scope and matter in hand: this foundation of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons to be the superaboundant merits and satisfactions, not onely of Christ, but of his Saintes also, holdeth Thomas Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, Dominicus Soto, Sylvester Pryeras, Antoninus, and others. Sylvester hath these wordes: <note place="margin">Sylvester de indulgent. Par. 4.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ratio quare valere possunt indulgentiae, est unitas corporis mystici, in qua multi supererogaverunt admen suram debitooum suorum, &amp; multas tribulationes iniustè sustinuerunt patientèr, per quas multitudo</hi>

                     <hi>poenarum poterat expiari, sieis deberetur: quorum meritorum tantaest copia, quòd omnem poenam debitam nunc viventibus excedunt, &amp; praecipue propter meritum Christi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The cause that pardons are of force, is the unitie of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall bodie, in which many have supererogated in the workes of penance, to the measure of their owne demerits, and have sustained patiently many uniust tribulations, through which the multitude of paines might be purged, if it were due unto them: of whose merites there is such plentie, that they exceede all paine due for those that nowe be living, and especially for the merite of Christ. This is the testimonie of Sylvester, and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinas <note place="margin">Tho. Aquinas in supplem. quaest. 25. art. primo.</note> their angelicall Doctor proceedeth further, and sayeth thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Christus poterat relaxare, ergo &amp; Paulus potuit, ergo &amp; Papa po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, qui non est minoris potestatis in Ecclesia, quàm Paulus fuit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Christ could pardon, therefore Paul could pardon, therefore the Pope also can pardon: as who is of no meaner authoritie in the Church, then Paul him selfe was. So then <hi>à primo ad ultimum</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The Popes power as great as Christes.</note> by Aquinas his doctrine, the Pope can doe as much as Christ. He can make the deafe to heare, the dumbe to speake, the lame to walke, the blinde to see, and the dead to arise to life: which I must first see, before I beleeve it, howsoever their holy Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas write: and yet should this follow necessarily, if Aquinas his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son were good. And doubtlesse, this which Aquinas here attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buteth to the Pope, is not farre from the peculiar marke of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, but I will not nowe stande upon that point. VVe see evidently the foundation of Popish pardons, confessed by the best learned Romish doctors. which manner of establishing po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish pardons, to be blasphemous and derogatorie to the blood of Christ, <hi>I</hi> proove many and sundrie wayes.

Our Lord Iesus came to die, he came not to sinne, communicating paine with us without sinne, he clensed both the sinne, and the paine of sinne. <hi>I</hi> proove the same secondly by the evident testimonies of the Popes owne Doctors, because no better arguments can possibly be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged against them, then such as them selves have made and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.

                  <p>The common opinion aswell of Divines as of Canonistes, holdeth that pardons be graunted of the abundant merits, which Christ and his Saintes here suffered, farre above the measure of their demerits: but I (saith Angelus) hold with Frauncis Mayro, that since God hath remunerated the merits of his Saintes above their condigne deserts, and so they are exhaust, nothing remaining unrewarded, that pardons onely are given of the merite of Christ, and of his passion. Durandus also a famous popish Doctor, holdeth the selfe same opinion with <note place="margin">Durand. in 4. sent. dist. 20.</note> Angelus: for albeit he admitteth the treasure of Christ, yet doeth he denie the treasure and supererogations of Saintes: and that, because as Angelus and Mayro teach, Saints have received remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration farre above their desertes: which opinion of Durandus, Angelus, and Mayro, S.

Their owne
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1677:23"/>
popish glosse confesseth the same in the comment vpon the text re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed, to wit, that our passions or satisfactions (as papistes terme <note place="margin">Glossa inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin. ibidem.</note> them,) are not worthy <hi>sidistricte nobiscu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ageretur,</hi> if God should deale with vs according to iustice. But as the said glosse addeth wisesely, <hi>facit spiritus quod merita non possunt,</hi> the holie ghost supplieth that which wanteth in our merits. And their clarke Nicolaus Lyranus can not denie the same, for these be his words: <note place="margin">Lyranus in cap. 8. ad Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ratio consistit in hoc, quod praemium excedit incomparabiliter meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum nostrum in tolerantia passionum, propter quod patienter sunt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritò tolerandae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reason saith Lyra, for vvhich the apostle mooueth vs to beare patientlie the afflictions of this vvorld, consisteth chieflie in this, that the reward which God vvill bestovv on vs, doth infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the worthinesse of our aflictions, or the condignitie of our pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: and for that respect, wee ought vvorthilie to endure them with patience. Neuerthelesse, Lyra vvould gladly haue our worke to bee meritorious, and for that end he distinguisheth them as they proceed of free wil, and as the holie Ghost worketh them, these are his words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sciendum tamen, quodpassiones istae dupliciter possant consider ari. v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>VVe must know for all this saith Lyra, that our afflictions may be considered two waies: one way, as they are accepted and receiued from our free will: and so the apostle speaketh, when he saith, they be vnworthie. Another way, as the holie ghost moouing our free will, is the beginning of this acceptation. And so there is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of condignitie, because the beginning of merite, is of the same dignitie with the rewarde. These are the wordes of Lyra, <note place="margin">Note well the confutatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Lyra his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction.</note> cited with all advantage for that cause, that he being once directly &amp; fullie confuted, all other papistes may be confuted in him: as who doubtles being all ioined in one, can lay no more then he hath done, in behalfe of their merites and supererogations. I therefore say first, <note place="margin">1</note> that Saint Paul affirmeth with me, that our afflictions or passions are not worthie the glorie of heaven.</p>
                  <p>I say secondly, that Lyra himselfe graunteth so much, as his owne woords alreadie alleadged do witnesse. <note place="margin">2</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>I say fourthly, that if al were granted vvhich Lyra saith, yet would it little or nothing helpe his purpose. <note place="margin">4</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>For first, our passions are no way ours, but as they proceede from <note place="margin">1</note>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:1677:24"/>
our free vvils: omnis enim actio humana est voluntaria: yea so vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie, that as Saint Augustine truely saith: if it vvere not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarie, it should not be mans: and yet our afflictions or passions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, as they proceed from our free will, are not worthie of the glorie to come by Lyraes ovvne graunt. Againe, when the holie ghost, and man worke both one and the same acte: that vvhich the holie ghost doth, can no more be reputed mans act, then that which man doth can be demed Gods acte. But so it is, that that vvhich ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doth can not be demed the holie ghosts deede: ergo neither that vvhich doth the holie ghost, can be demed mans deed. The assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein consisteth the difficultie, (if there be any at all,) is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by mans sinfull actions. For the most cruell and wicked fact that can bee imagined, is not done vvithout the concourse of the holy ghost, as all learned papistes doe and must confesse: and yet are mans sinfull actes so farre from being deemed Gods actes, as the deformities and irregularities thereof bee onely mans, and neuer Gods: and yet doth God concurre more to those vvicked actes, in that he is the principall agent of the real and positiue entities of the same, then man doth or can concurre to anie act of Gods: that is to say, to any good act that hee himselfe doth. For as S. Iames saith, euerie good thing that man doth, is of God. <note place="margin">Iacobis. v. 17</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdlie, because great absurdities do follovv vpon this opinion, to wit, that many sinnes freelie remitted and forgiuen in this life, should be punished eternallie in the vvorld to come. greater then vvhich, no absurditie can be thought vpon. the reason of the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent is yeelded by Thomas Aquinas, Dionisius Carthusianus, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onysius <note place="margin">Aquinas, p. 1. q. 114. ar. 3. ad 3, Dionys. Carthus. lib. 1. orthod fid. ar. 156. Areop. dc diuin. nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nib apud Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus.</note> Areopagita, and others. VVho all do hold, (neither is holy writ dissonant to their opinion,) that the deuils concurre if not to all, yet to the greater part of sinnes, committed in this life by sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mortall men. vvhereupon I inferre first, that the Deuils sinnes are mans, and mans sinnes the Deuils: if Lyraes distinction vvere of force the reason of the consequence is euident, because the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and man doe both one and the selfe same acte.</p>
                  <p>I inferre secondlie, that the sinnes forgiuen to penitent sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in this life, are punished in the Deuils world vvithout ende.</p>
                  <p>For vvhat replie so euer the adversary can make, or vvhat euasion so euer he shall vse in this point: the same can I make, and the same shall I vse against himselfe, in the passions and merites of Saintes. Let vvhat papist as vvill, beginne when hee vvill, to make triall thereof: For no effectuall disparitie doubtlesse, can euer bee yeelded in that behalfe.</p>
                  <p>Another absurditie is, that God should hereby bee the author or partaker of sinne. The reason hereof is euident, because as mans actes be meritorious, for that God concurreth to them: in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1677:24"/>
like maner Gods actes must bee demeritorious, for that man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curreth to the same. For God and man concurre no lesse to that selfe same act, vvhich is sinne: then they doe to that acte, vvhich the papistes terme of condigne merite. that there is no compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son betvvene mans deserts and glorie eternall, Saint Bede shevveth pithilie and plainelie in these vvords:</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>He saith, vvho suffered, and vvho knevv for vvhose sake he suffered, &amp; vvith vvhat fruit hee suffered: the sufferings of this life are not vvorthie of the future glorie, vvhich shall be reuealed in vs. I vveigh in the ballance that vvhich I suffer, against that vvhich I hope for: this I feele, that I beleeue, and yet that is of more force vvhich I beleeue, then that vvhich I feele. yea, as their ovvne durand telleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Christ himselfe could not satisfy in rigore iustitiae as he vvas man, but only <note place="margin">Durand. in 3. sent. dist. 20. &amp; in 4. d. 15.</note> in respect of hipostaticall vnion: &amp; therfore is it impossible that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of pure man, I say of corrupt and sinful man, shall any way be equivalent or perfect: for as the popes deare monke Dominicus So to granteth:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Perfecta satisfactio est illa, cuius valor &amp; pretiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>totu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> emanat a debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tore,</hi>

For our satisfaction is so vnperfect indeed, as no one of the 4. condicions here required, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be found and approoued therein. For first, vvhat act soeuer procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from our selves, as of our selues, is lothsom in Gods sight, accor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding to this say-ing of the Prophet:</p>

                     <hi>Dicendum, quo daliqua satisfactio potest dici dupliciter sufficiens: U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no modo perfectè, quia est condigna per quandam adaequationem ad reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  </p>
                  <p>VVe must answere, that satisfaction may be called sufficient two waies: one way perfectly, because it is vvorthie by a certaine ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatio nor equalitie to the compensation of the fault committed: And so the satisfaction of pure man, can not be sufficient for sinne. <note place="margin">Loc, here is a misterie, for not sufficient is sufficient.</note> Another vvay vnperfectly to vvit, according to his acceptation vvho is content vvith it, although it bee not vvorthie: and this vvay the satisfaction of pure man is sufficient.</p>
                  <p>This is the ansvvere of Aquinas, vvhose doctrine is confirmed for
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1677:25"/>
authenticall, by papall authoritie. Now marke it well, for Christes love. This great doctour was so busied to defend popish pardons, and the ground or foundation of the same, (which is the superero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of mans deserts, as we haue heard,) that he had no other shift in the worlde, but to coine a new no distinction of dubble sufficient satisfaction. which distinction for all that, if I doe not proove it to confute and make frustrate it selfe, I will desire no credite of the reader.</p>
                  <p>Satisfaction (saith Aquinas) may be called sufficient, either because it is indeed sufficient, as which is an equivalent compensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: or it may be called sufficient, not because it is equivalent and sufficient indeed: but because it is accepted and admitted, albeit it be not worthy.</p>
                  <p>Now what I pray you, can be more foolishly spoken, or more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a mans owne assertion? hee woulde establish a sufficient sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, and yet is enforced to acknowledge a satisfaction not sufficient, but accepted as if it were sufficient. which is the verie same that I would never denie, and which overthroweth all popish doctrine: For it prooveth in deed, that no workes of the regenerate are good and without sinue, though they be accepted and imputed for good and without sinne: and consequently, if the papistes would be constant in their owne doctrine, wee and they woulde soone agree. But what? doeth not our holy father the pope tell us, that though Christ pardon a penitent sinner, yet must he suffer tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall paine in purgatorie, and so to need the popes pardons? yes doubtlesse as you haue heard, and the pope and papists glory in the same. And yet this notwithstanding, if a man can get a plenarie pardon from the pope for the houre of his death, he shall come to heaven with all speed, and never once enter in at purgatorie gates. If any credit not my wordes, let him yet credit their doctout Sylve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, who writeth in this manner: <note place="margin">Sylvest. de in-dulg. par. 33.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>He that hath lawfully gotten a plenary pardon, if he should die at that instant, should incontinently goe to heaven. The popes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons then, are so farre from beeing such as they are preached to be: that they doe not onely not yeelde us any remission of paine, but greatly increase our paine when wee beleeve them: as vvhich de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate no little from Christes passion, and from the veritie of his sacred vvorde. For indeede saintes can no more satisfie for us, then <note place="margin">Soto in 4 sent. d. 21. q. 1. ar. 2. prope finem.</note> they can merite for us: and yet dareth not Dominicus Soto avouch their merites for us, though he be the popes doctor deare. For which cause vvisely and gravely saith Augustine:</p>

                  <head>The sixt Conclusion.</head>
                  <p>POpes usually giue many pardons, affirming most impudently in the same, that whosoeuer shall pray in such maner, say masse over such reliques, visite such a Church, or contribute so much to such an end, shall deliuer a soule from purgatorie. which kinde of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons, Pope Gregorie graunted often during my abode at Rosse: as to the bishop of Rosse, in the behalfe of the Scottish Queene: to Stukeley, for the trecherous practises he should haue contrived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst England: to Alphonsus the Iesuite, for the successe of English complots, and such like. This notwithstanding, these solemne and glorious pardons be nothing els, but mere fabulous and lying graunts.</p>
                  <p>For first, there is no purgatorie after this life as shall be prooved hereafter, and consequently the pope can deliver no soule from thence, though he graunt never so many pardons.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because to giue pardons is an act of Iurisdiction, as appeareth by the Scripture which they alledge, and consequently <note place="margin">Mat. 16. v. 19.</note> that act can not be exercised but upon the popes subiects, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not upon the soules in purgatorie, who are exempt from his iurisdiction. All which their owne schoole doctour Richardus de Mediavilla prooveth out of their canon-law in these wordes: <note place="margin">Richard. de Mediavilla in 4. sent. dist. 3. q. 3. dist. apud mag. 20. extra de pe. &amp; re.</note>

Pardons do not profit them, vvho are not of his iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them: but they vvho are in purgatorie, bee not vnder the iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of our prelates of the church. vvhich is sufficiently giuen to be vnderstood, vvhen our Lord said to Peter: (vvhatsoeuer thou shalt bind vpon earth:) for adding vpon earth, he seemeth to referre and extend this povver, onlie to the liuing here on earth. Novv, if answere be made as is vsed by the vviser sort of papistes, that the pope par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doneth in purgatory onelie by vvay of suffrage, then doe I reply, that that is <hi>petitio principij,</hi> and that that kind of pardoning is vncertaine and fallible, and so still I haue my purpose. For the preachers of the pardons, and the pardons also tell vs: that vvhosoeuer visiteth such a church, saith masse at such an aultar, or contributeth to such an ende, shall deliuer a soule from purgatorie. and yet by vvay of suffrage no such thing can bee assured, no more then vvhen an other devoute papist shall offer vp his prayers for them. vvhich thing seemed so to trouble Bellarminus, that in his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten dictates hee knovveth not vvell vvhat to holde or vvrite, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning romish pardons. Thirdly, because the pope can not applie Christs satisfaction more effectuallie to them by his pardoning, then the same is applied to them by the saying of masse, as vvhich by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish religion is the selfe same sacrifice reallie, that vvas offered vpon the crosse: and yet doth no papist saye or thinke that our saying of masse, can or vvil deliuer his friends soule from purgatory. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvise, there vvould not be so many masses said so many times for the selfe same persons, as hath beene and is daily seen, amongst the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists. For to this end doe they celebrate and obserue yerely anniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, for soules departed 10. 20. 30. 40. 60. yeares before. vvhich the pope, cardinals, and monkes had taught the people to frequent, as most necessarie for their friends soules in purgatorie. Fourthly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it cannot be proued, that after God hath pardoned our sinnes and the eternall paine due for the same, there still remaineth some temporal paine, remissible by the popes pardons. Fiftly, because al the three thinges required of papistes in popish pardoning, are most firm, certaine, and readie, in the soules of purgatorie: to vvit, aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie in thhe giuer, charitie in the receiuer, and the cause of pietie. For first, the soules of purgatorie bee in charitie, as all papistes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse: as vvho othervvise, could neuer be saued.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Secondly, it is mere crueltie not to helpe the faithful in such vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full case. Thirdlie, if they denie the popes auctoritie, I vvill vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linglie denie it vvith them: though he accurse me as hee hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die done, for my paines. For I nothing doubt, but God of his great mercie vvill conuert his curse, to my greater ioy and blisse. And here, because the Seminaries neuer ceasse to boast in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners amongest the simple: that none in this realme dareth to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1677:27"/>
with them, I offer publique dispute with what seminarie in England soeuer he be, no one or other excepted who soeuer: so it may stand vvith the honourable licence and good liking of higher povvers, whose mindes I am of dutie bound to obay in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe. For I nothing doubt, if my option may bee graunted: but that it will tend to the glorie of God, the service of my soveraigne, the honour of my countrie, the edification of the auditours, and the comfort of myne owne soule. The reason is, for that I know verie sufficientlie, the foundations, groundes, auctorities, and reasons, of both sides: and vvithal behold as in a glasse of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall, the euident confutation of all whatsoeuer, can possibly bee said in defense of papistrie: which if I had not first seene, I had neuer departed from popish doctrine.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>IF the popes pardons be not of so great force, and worth so much as they are said and preached to be: then is the popes religion vaine, and of no credite at all. This proposition both is and must be graunted of all papistes, if they will defend their now professed Romish religion. Thomas Aquinas (whose doctrine and bookes divers popes haue approoved for good and godly,) writeth thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ecclesia praedicando indulgentias non mentitur, &amp; ita tantum va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent quantum praedicantur: sicut enim dicit Augustinus, si in sacra</hi>

                     <hi>Scriptura deprehenditur aliquid falsitatis, iam robur authoritatis sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crae Scripturae perit. Et similiter si in praedicatione ecclesiae aliqua falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas deprehenderetur, non essent documenta Ecclesiae alicuius autboritatis adroborandam fidem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Church preaching pardons doth not lie, and so they are worth no lesse then they are preached. For as Augustine saith, if in holy Scripture any falshood be found, euen then the full authoritie of holy scripture perisheth utterly. And in like manner, if in the preaching of the Church any falshood should be found, the doctrine of the Church shoulde not be of any force to establish our faith. These are the wordes of their canonized saint and renowmed do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour Aquinas, which shewe unto us so plainely, as more plainely nothing can be told: that if the Church of Rome erre in any one point, as in giving pardons or such like, then must we giue no credit to it in other pointes of religion. Neither is this the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Aquinas onely, but their other great Thomist Dominicus Soto singeth the same song.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="tcp:1677:27"/>
These be his wordes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alij dixerunt indulgentias nihil prorsus valere, nisi quantum unusquisque devotione sua faciendo quodindulgentia praecipit, moere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Soto in 4. sent. dist. 21. q. 2. art. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Attamen isti seu blasphemi non sunt audiendi, sanè qui autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem Ecclesiae infringunt: si enim de hac re nos Ecclesia seduceret, nulla ei esset in reliquis adhibenda fides.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some said that pardons were no more woorth at all, then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man doeth merite by his owne devotion. But these fellowes are to be reiected as blasphemous, because they infringe the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie of the Church: for if the Church should in this point se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us, then were there no credite to be given unto it in other pointes. These are the expresse wordes of the Popes owne and best Doctors, Aquinas, and Soto: whose testimonies, with that which is said in other conclusions: disable altogether the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and religion of the Church of Rome. For if the Church of Rome deceive us in her pardons, (as is sufficiently prooved that she hath done:) then is she not to be credited in other things, as both Aquinas and Soto tell us: whose doctrine the pope, yea, sundry Popes of Rome have confirmed.</p>

                  <p>Pope Christopher, whose countrie and surname by reason of his basenesse is not knowen, came naughtilie by his Popedome, and lost it as naughtily. For before the seventh Moneth was fully expired, he was deprived of his Pontificall

                  <p>For to that passe was Popedome now brought, that who so coulde more in giving bribes, and in ambition, (I say not in good life and doctrine,) he onely should have the degree of honour, and good men should be reiected: which custome, would to God, it had never bene in our time kept. And the said Platina saith in another place:</p>

                  <p>For this custome did so increase, that now every ambitious fellow, might invade Peters seat or chaire. Gregorie the fift, was by sedition thrust out of his throne, and Pope Iohn 18 by tyranny occupied the Popedome: so say Carranza and Platina. Yea, Platina proceedeth <note place="margin">Carranza ubi supra fol. 355.</note> further, and saith thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qua quidem beatitudine Ioannes caruit, fur certè in Pontificatu, &amp;</hi>

                  <p>VVhich happie life Pope Iohn wanted, as who was a thiefe and a robber: for he entred not in by the doore, as he ought to have done. And to be briefe, Pope Bonifacius 8. shall sound the trumpet for the rest, of whom thus writeth Carranza: <hi>Intravit ut vulpes, regnavit ut lupus,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Carranza ubi supra fol. 369.</note>

                  <p>POPES may not only erre, and hold false opinions, but also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come most notorious heretikes; and for their heresies, be deprived of their popedomes. This conclusion may be proved, both by the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies of great learned papistes, and also by the flat decrees of many Popes. Dominicus Soto hath these wordes: <hi>Quamvis Papa, ut Papa errare non possit, hoc est, statuere errorem nequeat tanquam articulum fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei,</hi>

Albeit the Pope as Pope, can not erre: that is to say, can not set downe any errour as an article of our faith, because the holy Ghost will not that permit: neverthelesse, as he is a private person, so may he erre even in faith, as he may doe other sinnes: and for ful proofe of this point, only Sylvester Prieras is sufficient, who albeit he extol the Popes power above Kings, and Emperours, and Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their authoritie; yet doeth he confesse, that our holy father the <note place="margin">Sylvester in Papa. Par. 4.</note> Pope, <hi>in casu haeresis,</hi> both may be iudged and deposed: yea, this point is very manifest in many texts of the popish Canon-law, for in one place it is thus written:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oves, quae suo pastori commissae sunt, eum nec reprehendere, nisi à fide exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitaverit,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The sheepe that are committed to (the Pope) their Pastor, neither can reproove him, nor any way accuse him: unlesse he shall swarve from the faith. In another place it is said, that though the Pope be never so wicked, (though he carry thousands with himselfe headlong <note place="margin">Dist. 40. cap. si Papa.</note> to hell,) yet must no man iudge him, unlesse he be an heretique.</p>
                  <p>

Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus Angles, in his booke which he dedicated to the Pope himselfe, confirmeth this matter in these wordes:</p>

                  <p>MAny Popes have de facto forsaken the Christian faith, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come flat heretikes. This proposition, though it seeme strange to many, shalbe prooved (God willing) effectually, and that by the expresse testimonies of great popish doctors. For it is so certen, that Pope Honorius was an heretike, as their eight solemne Councel hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den at Constantinople, can not deny the same. Melchior Canus gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth this sentence of the said Honorius: <note place="margin">8. Conc. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant. act. 7.

Synode: Theodosius with his Synode at Hierusalem, in the confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their faith: Epiphanius answering to the heretikes, in the sight of the said Councell: finally, the seventh Synode wholly in the last action, and in their Epistle to all priests &amp; Clergie men. Viguerius holdeth for a constant position, that pope Anastasius erred in an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the faith: his wordes be these:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Si dicamus, quòd summus Pontifex errare potest, &amp; in animo suo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipere aliquem articulum orthodoxae fidei contrarium, &amp; etiam priuatim</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>If we say that the pope may erre, and conceive in his minde some article contrarie to the Catholike faith, and pronounce the same also privately: answere must be made, that the pope may erre as a private person, but not as he is Pope. Nicolaus Lyranus uttereth this matter <note place="margin">As we read of Anastasius.</note> so plainly, as no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> can long stand in doubt therof: these be his words:</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>VVhereby it is evident, that the Church doeth not consist in men, by reason of power or dignitie, either ecclesiasticall or secular: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause many Princes, and Popes, and other of the inferiour sort, are found to have swarved from their faith: for which cause the Church consisteth in those persons, in whome there is true knowledge, and confession of the faith, and veritie. Loe, the iudgement of their owne Doctor: not they that sit in S. Peters chaire, are the true and lawfull successours of S. Peter: but they that confesse, and preach S. Peters faith and doctrine. VVe therefore impugne nothing in popish pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, but the selfe same, which popish Doctors reprooved before us: and that in their publique writings, published to the world.</p>

                  <p>MANY Popes have erred, in their publique doctrine of faith and manners. Pope Iohn the 22. of that name, as witnesseth Okam, Erasmus, Alphonsus, Adrianus, &amp; others, taught the people that the soules of the iust doe not see God, before the resurrection: yea, Gerson that great popish doctor, (who sometime was Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Paris,) affirmeth this matter in these expresse wordes:</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>This he did to the thiefe (which by likelihood had not yet accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished <note place="margin">Of Pope Iohn</note> penance for all his sinnes,) who was blessed in that very houre, and sawe God face to face, as doe the Saintes in Paradise: by reason whereof, further appeareth the falshood of the doctrine of pope Iohn, which was condemned by the sound of trumpets before K. Philip by the devines of Paris, &amp; the King beleeved rather the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of Paris, then the court. In which words, we have to note first, that Gerson a voucheth the thiefe: crucified with Christ, to have seene <note place="margin">1</note> God face to face in that houre, &amp; so to be blessed. Secondly, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth the false doctrin of Pope Iohn, Thirdly, that his doctrine was <note place="margin">2</note> condemned with the sound of trupets, in the presence of the king of <note place="margin">3</note> France. Fourthly, that the K. gave more credit to the devines of Paris, then to the iudgement of the court of Rome. Fiftly, that neither the <note place="margin">4</note> K. nor the learned papists, did at that time grant such authority to the <note place="margin">5</note> Pope, as now the pope chalengeth. whreupon it foloweth conseque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the pope taught false doctrine in a weighty matter of faith: which thing not only Gerson affirmeth, as you have heard: but Pope Adrian himselfe testifieth the same, as recordeth the zealous papist Alphonsus in these wordes:</p>

                  <p>The fixt heresie teacheth no soule to be in blisse, before the day of iudgement, because (as it saith,) no soule before that day seeth God. The Armenians are the authors of this heresie and the Greeks hold the same. After these rose up pope Iohn, the 22. of that name. But least any man distrust my wordes in this point. I will recite the words of pope Adrian, who in his 4. book of sentences in the end of a certaine question of the sacrament of confirmation, sayeth this: Last of all, it is reported of Pope Iohn the 22. that he publikely
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1677:31"/>
taught, declared, and commanded all men to hold, that the soules of the lust, before the day of iudgement, have not the stole which is the cleare and facely vision of God. And he is reported, to have induced the Vniversity of Paris to this: that no man could take degree in the same, but he that first did sweare to defend this error, and to adheare unto it forever. Thus saith Adrian, who was him selfe pope of Rome: and thus reporteth Alphonsus a popish Friar. And it will not helpe to say, as Bellarminus doeth, in defence of popish faith: to wit, that pope Iohn erred as a private man, but not as pope: for that distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doeth not only want a good foundation, whereupon it should be built, but also it flatly destroyeth the plaine text: the reason hereof, is evident to every child. First, because Adrian saith, <hi>docuit,</hi> he taught. <note place="margin">1</note> Secondly, because he saith, <hi>publicè,</hi> publikly. Thirdly, because he saith, <note place="margin">2</note> 
                     <hi>mandavit,</hi> he commanded al to hold it. Fourthly, because none could <note place="margin">3</note> be made graduate, which held not this opinion. Fiftly, because every <note place="margin">4</note> graduate did sweare to defend it, and to hold it forever. So then the <note place="margin">5</note> pope may erre in publike decree of faith, aswel as an other man. And that, even by the consent of Adrian, who was pope him selfe: yea, who for learning and knowledge, was one of the rarest popes that ever was at Rome. Canus telleth us, that Gerson, Almain, &amp; Thomas VValdensis, do all hold, that the pope may erre, as is said. Pope Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine erred not only as a private man, (but even as pope and publike person,) in his publike decree of matrimonie. This to be so, witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the said Alphonsus, in these very words: <hi>Coelestinum papam errasse</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Alphons. lib. 1. cap. 4. advers. haereses.</note>

                        </gap> Pope Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestus.</note> fallen into heresie, is a thing so manifest, as all men know the same: neither was this error of Celestine such, as it ought to be imputed to negligence, so as we may think him to have erred as a private man, and not as pope, who ought in the decree of every serious matter, to aske counsell of learned men: for that definition of Celestine was in the old decretals, in the chap. <hi>laudabilem,</hi> and in the title <hi>de conversione infidelium,</hi> which I my selfe have seene &amp; read. By this assertion of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonsus, it is cleare that pope Celestine erred in the decree of faith. For first he saith, that Celestine erred, not as a private man, but as a pope, &amp; as a publike person. Secondly, he called it the decree <note place="margin">1</note> of a serious matter. Thirdly, he termed it a definition, enrolled in the <note place="margin">2</note> popes decretals. he therfore erred, as a publike person, in the publike <note place="margin">3</note> definition &amp; decree of faith.

Bellarminus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth this sentence of Nicholas to be false indeede, but he denieth it to be hereticall, because the church, that is, the pope hath not so defined it.

                  <p>It is wel knowen that it was decreed in a councel of England, and that iudgement was giuen most constantly, and exactly proued, that who soeuer was baptized without the inuocation of the trinitie, hee could not haue the sacrament of regeneration: which is altogether true: because, if that any shalbe washed in the fountain of baptisme, without the innocation of the trinitie: he is no perfect christian, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he be baptized in the name of the father, &amp; of the son, &amp; of the holy ghost. This also the priestes in that synod would haue obserued, that who so should omit but one person of trinitie in baptisme, that baptism could not be true. which thing is true for certainty: because, he that shall not confesse one person of the trinitie, can not be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect christian. by vvhich testimonies being not onely of popes, but of english papists also assembled in councel, we haue to note 2. things: the one, that the resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of pope Nicholas was a publique decree, &amp; no priuat opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: the other, that his decree was false, erroneous, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

But <hi>I</hi> surceasing from recitall of huge numbers, wil content my selfe with onely 3. to wit, Stephanus the 6. Iohn the 9. &amp; Sergius the 3. For first, pope Stephanus made fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate <note place="margin">Platina in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis pontificum.</note> and of none effect, the orders receiued of pope Formosus his predecessor. but shortly after, pope Iohn disanulled &amp; made frustrate the acts of pope Stephanus, &amp; approued the acts of pope Formosus. yet after all this, pope Sergius vndid againe the acts of pope Formosus, &amp; of pope Iohn, &amp; approved the actes of pope Stephanus the sixt. These shamefull and erroneous constitutions &amp; factes of these three popes are so true, as not onely Baptista Platina, a graue popish historiogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, but Carranza also, yea &amp; Bellarminus himself do al confesse the same. wherin we haue first to consider, that amongst the papists order is an holie sacrament, &amp; impresseth in the receiuer, an indelible chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter: by vertue wherof once a bishop must euer he a bishop by popish doctrine, how soeuer iurisdiction be taken away: and consequently, since For nosus was once a bishop: to wit, episcopus Portuensis, as <note place="margin">Argumentum ad hominem.</note> saith Platina: and by vertue thereof had their indelible character, and power to giue orders: it was a most manifest errour in faith, and most wicked fact in maners, to decree as pope Stephanus, and pope Sergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us did: that orders giuen by pope Formosus were not true orders, but none at all: and thereupon to commaund with the notorious scandall of all the world: that all such as were made priestes by him <note place="margin">where is now their charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter indelibilis?</note> should take orders againe, as if they had beene of the meere lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call order.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 First, that the pope as pope may erre when he alone decreeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie matter of faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 I note secondlie, that the pope, as pope may erre, vvhen he defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth anie matter of faith vvithout a generall councell: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentlie, that he may erre vvith a prouinciall councell.</p>

                  <p n="4">4 I note fourthlie, that all this is testifyed by foure great learned papistes, vvhereof one vvas pope himselfe.</p>
                  <p>These testimonies are important, doubtlesse, &amp; verie sufficient to establish my conclusion. But I vvill alleage yet another proofe, so excellent, so evident, and so irrefragable, as more cannot be vvish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The proofe standeth thus.</p>
                  <p>Pope Stephanus, vvith a councell of all the bishops and priestes of Italie, defined flatlie against rebaptization. vvhich decree of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell vvith the popes assent thereto: Saint Cyprian contemned, after it defending his former opinion constantlie. yea he vvas so far from acknowledging that prerogatiue in popes, vvhich they of latter daies chalenge vnto them selues, that he vvould not take pope Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus for his superiour, or to haue anie iurisdiction ouer him, but termed him, <hi>superbum, imperitum, &amp; caeeae ac prauae mentis,</hi> proud, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, blind, and naughtie, as is euident to such as reade his epistle to Pompeius. Out of vvhich I note:</p>
                  <p n="1">1 First, that Cyprian vvas an holie martir, &amp; novv a saint in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen..</p>

                  <p n="3">3 I note thirdly, that he knevv vvhat the pope and his councell had decreed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 I note fourthly, that he iudged a romish cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cel to be of no greater

I note fiftlie, that hee iudged the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Italie to bee of no greater force for the Popes consent, then was <note place="margin">5</note> the Councell of Afrike for his owne consent. I note sixtlie, that provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <note place="margin">6</note> Councels are of no greater authoritie for the Popes confirmation, than for the confirmation of another bishop: all which pointes are necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie deduced, out of Saint Cyprians fact, and writings. And Bellarminus <note place="margin">Bellarm. lib. 4 de Rom. Pont. cap. 7</note> answere hereunto is frivolous, and not worth the rehearsall. The Pope defined not the controversie as a matter of faith (saith Bellarminus) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he did not excommunicate Saint Cyprian: A sweet dish of a messe of mustarde. The Pope utterlie disliking Saint Cyprian his opinion, and deeming it repugnant to Christes Gospell, and for that ende convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all the Clergie men of Italie, did define the controversie, but not <note place="margin">Bellerminus is confuted.</note> as a matter of faith, saith Bellarminus. The controversie was about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptization, which was either flatlie with the Gospell, or flatlie against the same. If it were flatlie with the Gospell, then erred the Pope and his Councell egregiouslie: If it were flatlie against the Gospell, and the Pope decreed it, then decreed he against it, as against a matter of faith, or els o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions against the Gospell are not against faith.</p>

This may seeme strange unto thee (gentle Reader,) as sometimes ir did unto my selfe: but I shall (God willing) unfold the obscuritie with such evident perspicuitie, as never man henceforth can stand in doubt thereof. This shall bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed, if I prooue 4, things: First, if I proove that the decrees of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels be of no force with papists, unles the Popes Legates consent unto the <note place="margin">1</note> same. Secondlie, if I proove that though the Popes Legates agree unto the decrees of Councels, yet are the said decrees of no force: if the legates <note place="margin">2</note> shal consent unto anie one iot, contrarie to the Popes appointment.

Fourthlie, if I proove that he wil not come to the Councels himselfe, but determine everie thing at home <note place="margin">4</note> in his chamber. the proofe hereof shall be the flattestimonie of Melchior Canus, a most profounde Schoolman in reasoning, a most reverend Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop

                  </p>
                  <p>If the Legate doe anie thing contrary to instruction given him, hee must not be deemed to proceede of power delegate, and so there is no cause why the pope shall be thought to approve the decrees: The decrees therefore, which the Legate shall approove against tradition of the Church <note place="margin">To what ende are Councels, when everie thing must be as the Pope saith at home.</note> of Rome, have no authoritie from the Church of Rome, neither are they of anie more force, than if they had proceeded from the Councell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out consent of the Legates: The sound authoritie therefore, which Peter hath in confirming his brethren and decrees, he cannot transferre unto his Legates. These are the expresse wordes of Canus, that great piller of popish doctrine. Out of whose wordes I note first, that decrees of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels bee of no force without consent of the Legates.

I note thirdlie, that the Pope cannot translate or give his authoritie unto the Legate, and consequentlie, the Pope greatlie abuseth the whole world, when he calleth together all bishops in the Christian world, and yet will allowe nothing that they doe: unles it be the same that hee decreeth, in his chaire at home. Now that hee never commeth to Councels in his owne person, Bellarminus recordeth in this maner:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Summus Pontifex nunquam interfuit Concilijs Orient alibus per</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Pope was never present at the Councels in the East Church, in his owne person: and why was not the Pope present at generall Councelles in the East Church? Bellarminus giveth two reasons; the one forsooth, because it was not convenient, that the heade should follow the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. The other, because the Emperour would ever sitte in the highest <note place="margin">Mark what the Popes vassal saith,</note> place: which our humble Father the Pope, coulde not endure. Out of vvhose wordes I note two thinges: the one, that the highest

place in Councels, was in olde time reserved to the Emperour: the other, that the Greeke Church did never acknowledge the Popes primacie.</p>

                  <p>IN these latter dayes since the Pope attained his usurped iurisdiction, generall Councelles are so destitute of the holie Ghostes asistance, (though the Papistes never cease to bragge thereof) that they decree al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together against the holie Ghost. This is manifest by the solemne de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the late Councel of Trent, as after due examination will evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie appeare. First therefore, the saide Councell decreed flatlie, that to be no matrimonie which was approoved Matrimonie, by the uniforme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the auncient Catholike Church, and which is this day perfect Matrimonie by Christes institution: These be the wordes of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,</p>

                  <p>They that shall goe about to marrie otherwise, than in the presence of the parish Priest, or of some other priest, by his licence, or graunt of the Ordinarie, and with two or three witnesses those the holie Counsell maketh utterlie uncapable of Mariage, and defineth by this present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, such contracts to be frustrate and of no force. By which words and by which decree we see plainelie, that this day those persons are made uncapable of matrimonie, and their mariage disanulled, whom Christ <note place="margin">Behold here the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of popish Councels.</note> pronounceth capable, and whose marriage hee approoved. For before this decree of the late Councell of Trent, all papistes in the worlde ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooved private and secrete matrimonies, for true and perfect: yea, all learned papistes doe confesse constantlie, such clandestine matrimonies to be true mariages in England, albeit that such contracts be of no force neither in Spaine nor Italie, by their religion. The reason hereof is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause promulgation of the said Tridentine Councels decree was not yet made in England, as appeareth by the first Cannon in the eight secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>dereformatione.</hi> This constant opinion of all Divines, the Councell it selfe acknowledged in these wordes,</p>

                  <p>There is no doubt, but clandestine and secrete matrimonies made with free consent, were perfect and true matrimonies, so long as the Church did not disanull the same. Yea, the Councell of Trent acknowledgeth

matrimonie, to be one of the seven Sacraments of the newe Testament instituted by Christ, and yet accurseth all such as beleeve not the Church of Rome, to have authoritie to dissolve the same. These be the wordes:</p>

                  <p>If anie shal say, that the Church could not appoint impediments which dissolve matrimonie, or that the Church erred in appointing them, accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be that man. These bee the decrees of the holie Councell of Trent, which, as the Papists beleeue, had the assistance of the holie Ghost, and therefore could not erre. Out of which decrees we have first, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie <note place="margin">1</note> is a contract instituted by Christ himselfe: we have secondlie, <note place="margin">2</note> that it is an holie Sacrament with the Papistes: Wee have thirdlie, that it is now no Sacrament with the Papistes, which by Christs institution is a <note place="margin">3</note> Sacrament in their religion: We have fourthlie, that matrimonial con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractes, made without the presence of a Priest: are true and perfect ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonies, <note place="margin">4</note> by Christes law and institution: We have fiftlie, that such ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonies, <note place="margin">5</note> to wit, clandestine, are disanulled and made no matrimonies, by the Pope and his Tridentine Councell. neither will it help to say, as the wiser sort of Papists doeth, that the Councell doeth not unmarie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons alreadie married, but onelie disableth unmaried persons so, as their prohibited marriages cannot be of force. For, first, the Councell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth that to be no Mariage, by reason of mans prohibition, which <note place="margin">1</note> without such prohibition should bee perfect mariage by Christs instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: as is alreadie prooved out of the said Councell. Secondlie, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition taketh away the libertie of the Gospell, as which implyeth a <note place="margin">2</note> negative precept not contained in the law of nature: for as their famous popish doctour <hi>Franciscus à Victoria</hi> writeth,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lex Evangelicalex libertatis d Christo &amp; Apostolis vocatur, quod</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The lawe of the Gospell is tearmed the lawe of libertie, by Christ and his Apostles: because after the Gospell Christians are bound onelie to the law of nature, concerning all such things as were in the olde Law. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1677:36"/>
because this to do, is to challenge greater authoritie than Christ hath, and to be aboue Christ. The reason whereof is evident, because an inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our cannot chaunge the law of his superiour, unlesse he haue from his su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour commission so to doe: which Victoria well observed in these wordes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dispensatio in lege spectat solùm ad legislatorem, vel superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem,</hi>

                     <hi>vel adillum cui specialiter commiserint ipsi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dispensation in the Law pertaineth onelie to the lawmaker, or to his superiour, or to whome they speciallie graunt commission: If answere be made, that the Pope hath such commission: then would I know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he received it by word or writing: in the meane season the saide Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoria telleth the Pope, that he cannot dispence in the law divine. These be his wordes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Manet ergo conclusio tanquam certa &amp; firma, quod in primo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Victor. ubi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prà.</note> 
                     <hi>praeceptorum Concilij, scilicet quae sunt iuris divini, Papa non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test dispensare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The conclusion therefore abideth firme and sure, that in the first kind of preceptes of the Councell: to wit, which are of the lawe divine, the Pope cannot dispence. And of Victoria his opinion, are Thomas Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, Anthoninus, Sylvester, Soto, Covarruvias, and all learned papistes. Fourthlie, because that which is of more force, to wit, a simple vow, doth <note place="margin">4</note> not dissolve matrimonie: for if that which is of greater force cannot disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null matrimonie, much lesse can that doe it, which is of lesser force, as both the rule of logick and experience teacheth. Now, that a simple vowe is of greater force than the Popes prohibition, cannot be denied: for it is <hi>de iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re divino,</hi> as all the Papistes confesse, and as the Scripture recordeth. And <note place="margin">Psal. 75 Eccl. 5</note> that a simple vow doeth not dissolve matrimonie: Angelus prooveth at <note place="margin">Angelus de mattimon. imped. 5</note> large, out of the popish Cannon law. Fiftlie, because the Pope or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell cannot change the essence or essentiall partes of matrimonie, for so saith the Tridentine Councell. And if it were otherwise, the Pope might <note place="margin">5</note> make more or fewer Sacraments at his pleasure: whereuppon it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth necessarilie, that all matrimoniall contractes bee as perfectlie matrimonies this day, as they were in Christs time: notwithstanding the prohibition of the Pope, or of his Councell. For the essence and substantiall partes abiding unaltered and perfect, the matrimonie must needes be perfect. Sixtlie, because the Priest is meere extrinsecall unto the contract, and therfore cannot necessarilie concurre to the essentiall <note place="margin">6</note> constitution thereof. The Councell then in this decree, was destitute of the holie Ghost. The saide Councell affirmeth the solemne vowe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to dissolve matrimonie in these wordes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Si quis dixerit matrimonium ratum non consummatum, per so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnem</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Conc. Triden. de mat, Sess. 8. can. 6.</note>

                     <pb facs="tcp:1677:36"/>
If any shall say that matrimonie firme not consummate, is not dissolved by solemne profession of religion of the one partie, accursed be that man. This decree likewise is flat against the holie Ghost: which to be so, <hi>I</hi> prove by sundrie meanes. The Councell it selfe shall first confute it selfe, when it saith thus:</p>

Whereuppon I inferre first, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie before consummation, or carnall copulation: is indissoluble by the holie Ghosts appointment. I inferre secondlie, that the Councel of Trent dissolveth matrimonie before consummation.

I inferre fourthlie, that that may trulie be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified of the Pope and his Councel of Trent: which their owne Doctour Victoria soundeth out against them, in these words:</p>

                  <p>If the Councell declare anie thing to be of faith or of the lawe divine, in this point the Pope can nothing otherwise declare or change: especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, if such law appertaine either to faith or maners of the universal Church. Of this opinion are manie other learned papistes, and especiallie, their Angelicall Doctor Thomas Aquinas: that everie generall Councell is above the Pope: great learned papistes affirme constantlie, to wit, Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lensis, Panormitanus, Ioannes Gerson, Almainus, Cardinalis Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racensis, and Cardinalis Florentinus. Panormitanus argueth out of Pope <note place="margin">Panorm. in Concil.

                  <p>Bellarminus graunteth, that albeit Cameracensis, Gerson, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, Cusanus, Pavnormitanus, Florentinus, Abulensis, (who all are great popish doctors,) doe differ in the maner, yet doe they all acknowledge the povver of a generall councell, to be greater then the authoritie of the pope.</p>
                  <p>These be his verie owne words:</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>But they all agree in this, that they teach this power to be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly in the church: and therefore when the Pope is dead, or depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, or will not come to the councel (as he neuer doth,) that then the councell is not an vnperfect bodie, but perfect, and hath papall power to define matters of faith, to make lawes, to giue pardons, &amp;c. VVhereupon they gather that the councell is aboue the pope, that it can iudge him and punish him, and that it is all one to demaunde if the pope be greater then the councell, as if it were asked if the part be bigger then the whole. The councell of Basill defined it for an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our faith, to beleeue that the councell is aboue the pope.</p>
                  <p>These be the expresse words of the councell:</p>

                  <p>The veritie of the power of a generall councell representing the vniuersall church aboue the pope, and euerie other person declared by the generall councell of Constance, and this of Basil, is the verie truth of the catholike faith. And the councell addeth another clause, to wit, that whosoeuer denieth this veritie obstinately, is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted <note place="margin">25. q. 1. cap. unt quidam.</note> for an heretike.

                  <head>The fourth Conclusion.</head>
                  <p>GEnerall and popish councels in these daies, are as a nose of waxe, and the decrees therof as vncertaine as the wind.</p>
                  <p>This conclusion is proved to be such, by the expresse iudgement of great learned papistes.</p>
                  <p>Bellarminus writeth of councels, in this maner:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nos dicimus, concessum episcoporum in concilijs legitimis esse verum</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Bellar. de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lib. 1. cap. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>iudicum concessum, &amp; eorum decreta &amp; leges necessario sequendas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>vve say, that the assembly of Bishops in lavvfull councels, is the true assembly of iudges, and that their decrees and lavves must bee followed of necessitie.</p>
                  <p>But in another place, the same Bellarminus hath these vvords:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dico igitur, concilium illud non posse errare, quod absolutè est genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Bellar. lib. 2. de concil. cap. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp; ecclesiam vniversam perfectè representat: eiusmodi autem conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium non est, antequam adsit sententia summi pontificis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I</hi> say therefore, that that councell cannot erre, which is absolutely generall, and vvhich representeth the vniuersall church perfectly: but such a councell is not before the pope giue his assent. And hee saith againe in the selfe same chapter:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Idem enim est sive pontifex expresse concilium reprobet, sive conciliu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> agat contra pontificis sententiam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For it is all one, whether the pope expressely disalow the councel, or the councell doe against the popes mind. Now in the first place Bellarminus telleth vs, that bishops are true iudges in the councels, and haue definitiue voices in the same: and that their decrees must <note place="margin">Mat contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in the Iesuite.</note> needes be followed. But in the other two places he singeth another song and telleth vs, that though the Pope commeth not in person to the councels, but sendeth his legats in his place: yet are the decrees of such councels of no force, nor to any purpose, vnlesse they bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the popes mind. They are therefore as a nose of waze, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, when the bishops haue imploied their whole industrie, when they haue vsed long consultation, when they haue disputed the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1677:38"/>
                     <hi>pro &amp; contra:</hi> when they haue inuocated the holy ghost, and haue with mature deliberation set downe cannons, accursing such as will not obay the same: the pope notvvithstanding saith, all this is not worth a stravv, as which is contrarie to his opinion, that cannot erre, and so of none effect.</p>
                  <p>For the vncertaintie of the decrees of councels, Bellarm. saith thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Non potest fieri vt aliquando adfinem controuersiarum deveniatur, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidetur</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>It cannot be, that euer an end of controversies should be made, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the greater part of voices bee of force: and he saith in another place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Est autem verum decretum concilij quod fit a maiori parte, alioqui nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>For it is the true decree of the councell, vvhich hath the consent of the greater part: othervvise there should bee no lavvfull decree made, because euer some dissent.</p>
                  <p>But Melchior Canus telleth vs another tale, and saith in this maner:</p>

                  <p>Not therfore as in humaine consents the voices of moe are of force vvith vs: for these thinges are not iudged in number, but in weight: and the councels receiue their weight from the grauitie and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the pope: vvhich if it be once present an hundreth fathers are enough, but if it vvant, none are enough, be as manie as they vvill.</p>
                  <p>Novv sir, Bellarminus telleth vs, that moe voices in councelles must needes be of force: But Canus saith, it is not so: for bee they manie, be they few, what part the pope liketh shall be true.</p>
                  <p>The decrees therefore of popish councels, are as vncertaine as the vvind. For after the fathers of the councels haue fasted long, praied much, consulted gravely, deliberated maturely, decreed soberlie, commaunded strictlye, and accursed severely: neither others, nor yet themselues canne tell, what shall be of force therein: for all must be as pleaseth the popes holinesse, &amp; perhaps their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees will not content his mind.</p>

                  <head>The fift Conclusion.</head>
                  <p>NO bishops can in these our daies haue voices in councels, but such as first sweare obedience to the pope, and promise to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his canon law: which thing, though most absurd, is for all that so cleare, as Bellarminus cannot denie the same.</p>
                  <p>These be his words. <note place="margin">Bellar. lib. 1. de concil. cap. vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timo.</note>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Istud iur amentum non tollit epi scoporum libertatem, quae in concilijs necessaria est. iur ant enim se fore obedientes summo pontifici, quod in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligitur donec pontifex est, &amp; dum iubet ea quae secundum deum &amp; sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cros canones iubere potest, seanon iur ant se non aicturos quod senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt in concilio, vel se non deposituros eum si hereticum esse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This oth taketh not avvay the libertie of Bishops, which in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels is necessarie. For they sweare that they vvill bee obedient vnto the pope, which is to be vnderstood, so long as he is pope, and while he commaundeth those thinges, which he may commaund agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, and to the holie cannons: but they sweare not, that they will not speake vvhat they thinke in the councell, or that they will not depose him if they proove him to bee an heretique.</p>
                  <p>Thus saith Bellarminus, vvhose onely testimonie is most sufficient <note place="margin">A point wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.</note> in all popish affaires, as vvho is the popes sworne and tenderlye beloued vassall: Out of whose vvordes for more perspicuitie, I note.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 First, that all Cleargie men admited to giue voices in councelles, are sworne vvholly to obey all the popes constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 I note secondly, that the sayd persons are sworne to beleeue, that the pope cannot erre in his iudiciall decrees of faith or maners: that no councels are of force, vvithout the popes confirmation: thatall councels confirmed by him, are approued by the holie ghost: that he can excommunicate &amp; deposeall Emperours, kings, queenes, and bishops in the christian vvorld, that hee can deliuer by his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons all soules out of purgatorie, and a thousand like things. For all such matters are conteined in his canons, and consequentlie in their most lamentable oth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 I note thirdly, that they are svvorne to admit his decrees, vvho as they beleeue, may be an heretique.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 I note fourthly, that they are svvorne to admit his iudgement in all matters of faith, vvhom yet they may iudge and depose for heresie.</p>

                     <pb n="61" facs="tcp:1677:39"/>
5 I note fiftly, that their fundamentall article, in appointing the Pope iudge over all controversies: is quite overthrowen and turned vpside downe, in this <hi>Bellarminus</hi> his explication. For when he saith, (while he commandeth, &amp;c.) he graunteth every Bishop freedome <note place="margin">The incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish doctrine, is the cause of dissenting from them.</note> to examine and iudge, when the Pope commaundeth things agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God and the Canons. VVhich libertie, if they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly performe: all true Christians and perfect Catholicks, would agree with them. For none that beleeve rightly in God, will denie obedience to the Pope: when he preacheth and teacheth any thing, agreeable to God and holy Canons. But true Christians finding his canons to be disholy, and his decrees to be against God: thinke as Bellarminus here teacheth them, that they are not bound to obey him. For as an other great learned papist Franciscus à Victoria saith profoundly, the vniust laws of the Pope doe not binde in conscience. These are his very words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ego pro certo habeo, quod omnes leges iniustae etiam Papae, non obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I holde it for a constant and vndoubted truth, (saith the Popes learned Doctour,) that all uniust lawes even of the Pope, doe not bind in the Court of conscience.</p>
                  <p>The Papistes then, who charge us so strictly to obey the popes lawes, and withall prohibite us to examine the same, doe deny us that libertie, which they take unto them selves: and that the Reader may fully understand the abomination of the othe, which all popish Bishops sweare unto the Pope: <hi>I</hi> will here set downe the expresse wordes thereof, as I finde them in their owne decretals:</p>

                     <hi>The</hi> 1. <hi>Conclusion.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE pope vsually dispenseth vvith professed Monkes, that they may marrie lawfullie: which dispensation is not onely against the lavve divine with them, but flatlye against the Popes owne religion.</p>
                  <p>In this conclusion, three thinges are to be proued.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>
                        <label>1</label> First, that the pope doth dispense, as is said.</item>
                     <item>
                        <label>2</label> Secondly, that his dispensation is against the law diuine.</item>
                     <item>
                        <label>3</label> Thirdly, that it is against his owne religion.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>For the first part, Navarrus writeth in this maner: <note place="margin">Navarrus de iuditiis, notab. 3. p. 275</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Papa potest dispensare cum monacho iam professo, vt contrahat ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonium: imò de facto multi papae dispensaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Consentit ipse Caie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus, Antoninus, &amp; Paludanus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The pope may dispense vvith a Monke alreadie professed, that hee may take a wife and marrie: for many popes de facto haue dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed so Caietanus, Antoninus, and Palludanus are of the same opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. For the second point Victoria writeth thus: <hi>Multitenent quod</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">victor. de potest. papae, relect 4. ad 3. argument.</note> 
                     <hi>Papa non potest dispensare in votis, quia dispensatio proprie est relaxatio iuris. vnde cum sit de ture divino, dispensatio erit iuris divini relaxatio, quod sane ad papam non spectat. &amp; vtinam haec opinio non sit vera.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many hold, that the Pope can not properlie dispense in vowes, because dispensation properly is the relaxation of the Lavv. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon since a vow is of the law divine, dispensation must bee remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the lavv divine: which thing doubtles belongeth not vnto the Pope: and would to God this opinion were not true.</p>
                  <p>Loe, this religious Frier is so zealouslie affected towards the popes credite, that he vvisheth the opinion which overthrovveth his prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise were not true.</p>
                  <p>And the Popes famous Canonist Covarruvias, writeth to the same effect in these vvords: <note place="margin">Covarruvias to. 1 c. 20. par. 11 in med. ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius col. prima</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nec me latet D. Thomam previa maxima deliberatione asserere, Rom. Pontificem non posse propria dispensatione continentiae solemne Monachorum votum tollere. &amp; paulo post: oportet tamen pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam opinionem defendere, ne quae passim fiant evertantur om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nino.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither am I ignorant, that Saint Thomas affirmeth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Necessitie hath no law, the popes mind must be obered.</note> greate deliberation; that the Bishoppe of Rome can not vvith his dispensation, take away from Monkes their solemne vowe of chastitie: This notwithstanding vvee muste defende the first opinion, lest those things vvhich are practised euery where,
<pb facs="tcp:1677:41"/>
be utterly overthrowne: thus saith the great Canonist and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend <note place="margin">The popes do<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ings must be defended, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise poperie cannot stand.</note> popish bishop Covarruvias, out of whose wordes sundrie things may be noted worthy the observation.</p>
                  <p>First, that the papistes cannot agree about the Popes authority.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that great learned papistes among whome Thomas Aquinas is one, (whose doctrine sundry Popes haue confirmed,) <note place="margin">1</note> doe denie the Popes authoritie in the premisses. <note place="margin">2</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that the contrary opinion must be defended, for the honestie and safegard of the popes religion. <note place="margin">3</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that most miserable is the Popes doctrine, which nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth such poore and beggerly shiftes for the maintenance thereof. <note place="margin">4</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fiftly, that the papists haue no cause so to exclaime against priests mariage, since the Pope dispenseth with his monkes to marry at <note place="margin">5</note> their pleasures. For the mariage of priestes is onely prohibited by the Popes law, but the marriage of monkes by the law divine, as the Popes owne deare doctours Victoria and Aquinas tell us.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, that Aquinas his doctrine, which the Pope hath approo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <note place="margin">6</note> confuteth the Popes religion. For the third point, Thomas Aquinas giveth this testimony, out of the Popes owne law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abdicatio proprietatis sicut etiam custodia castitatis, adeo annexa est regulae monachali, ut contra ea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nec summus Pontifex possit indulgere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The renouncing of propertie, as also the keeping of chastitie, is so annexed to the rule of monkes, that the Pope him selfe cannot dispence against the same: this saying of Thomas Aquinas, is found verbatim in the popes canons, <hi>Extra destatu monachorum</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Extra de statu monachorum cum ad mon.</note>

                  <p>THe Pope often pronounceth matrimony dissolved by his dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations, which is firme and stable by Christes owne instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The first part is prooved by Martinus Navarrus, in these words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dividitur (matrimonium) ante consummationem, per dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem Papae iusta de causa factam.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Navarr. in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chir. cap. 22. par. 21.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Matrimonie is dissolved before consummation, by the popes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation vpon iust cause graunted. And a litle after he hath these wordes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quorum opinio adeo observatur, quodetiam ter vel quater adpetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones consilio meo antequam in urbem venissem oblatas, Paulus</hi> 3. &amp; <hi>Pius</hi> 4. <hi>per suas dispensationes dissolverunt quaedam matrimonia om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nino clandestina nondum consummata, in remedium animarum ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oquin probabiliter periturarum.</hi>

                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:1677:41"/>
whose opinion (he speaketh of the Canonistes who generally are of his owne opinion,) is so observed, that thrise or foure times before my comming to Rome upon petitions made by my advise, <note place="margin">Loe, how rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily the Pope displeaseth God, for the pleasure of man.</note> Pope Paulus the third and pope Pius the fourth, with their dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations dissolved certen secret matrimonies not yet consummate, for the safegard of soules which by likelihood woulde otherwise haue perished. And Covarruvias affirmeth Paulus the fourth and Iulius the third, to haue dispensed in like maner: these be his words. <hi>Nec me latet Paulum quartum summum ecclesiae Pontificem,</hi> Ann. 1558. <hi>hac vsum fuisse dispensatione quibusdam ex causis, quas iustissimas esse idem summus ecclesiae praesul existimavit. idem paulo ante Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Neither am I ignorant that Pope Paulus the 4. put this dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in practise, for certaine causes which the same Pope thought to be most iust. Iulius the third when he was Pope, graunted in like cause the same dispensation.</p>
                  <p>The second part is prooved, by the vniforme consent of all divines. For Bellarmine saith; <note place="margin">Bellar. lib. i. c. 5. de matrim prope finem.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Non autem essentialia matrimonia (ecclesia) vllo modo mutat, aut mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tare potest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the essentiall partes of Matrimonie, the Church neither doth change, neither can change.</p>
                  <p>And doubtles if the Church can not doe it, <hi>á fortiori,</hi> the Pope can not doe it, which Bellarmine will not denie, and Victoria doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse no lesse in these words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Communis schola theologorum negat maiorem, scilicet quod Papa</hi>

                     <hi>possit dispensare, sed in contrarium sunt multi doctores Cannonista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The common schoole of Divines denieth the maior, to wit, that the Pope can dispence with matrimonie, but many Cannonists holde the contrarie.</p>
                  <p>Cov arru vias likewise saith thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tutior ac verior est communis theologorum opinio, quae probat matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monium</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Covarruv. to. t. par. 2. cap. 7. par. 4. n. 14. in medio.</note> 
                     <hi>ratum nondum secut â commixtione carnis &amp; sic non consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum, minime posse dissolvi Rom. Pontif. dispensatione.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The common opinion of Divines is more safe and true, which prooveth that matrimonie perfected by consent, but not consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate by carnall copulation, can not be dissolved by the Popes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation.</p>
                  <p>And the said Covarruvias addeth these words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ipse vero non auderem à communi theologorum sententia disce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:1677:42"/>
I my selfe truely durst not forsake the common opinion of devines. And no marvell: for Christ himselfe putteth the marter out of all doubt, when he saith: <note place="margin">Mat. c. 19. v. 7.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quod Deus coniunxit homo non separet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That which God hath conioined, let no man put asunder.</p>
                  <p>And in another place he saith thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Omnis qui dimittit vxorem suam, &amp; alteram ducit, maecatur.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Luc. c. 16. v. 18.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Everie one that putteth avvay his wife, and marrieth another, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth adulterie.</p>
                  <p>And Saint Paul vpon the same argument, hath these wordes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His autem qui matrimonio iuncti sunt, precipio non ego sed Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7. v. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Uxorem a viro non discedere, quod sidi scesserit, manere innuptam, aut Uiro suo reconciliari, &amp; vir vxorem non dimittat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Those that are married commaund not I, but the Lord, that the wife depart not from her husband: but if shee shall depart, then to abide vnmarried, or to be reconciled to her husband.</p>
                  <p>Thus saith Christ, thus saith saint Paul, that man and wife ioined by Christ, must abide during life together, or liue vnmarried, and nor be seuered by the popes dispensation. Neither will it helpe to say as Bellarm. doth, &amp; others with him: that Christ onely speaketh <hi>de matrimonio consummato,</hi> and that <hi>matrimonium ratum,</hi> with which the pope dispenseth, is not <hi>de iure divino:</hi> For first, if <hi>matrimonium ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">vvhat an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd ansvvere is this?</note> were not <hi>de iure divino:</hi> the greatest popish deuines would not denie the popes dispensation therein: as who graunt him power o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all lawes humane.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Secondly, Christ speaketh absolutely, and maketh no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of copularion or popish consumation, vvhich is all one.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Thirdly, with papistes matrimonie is a deuine sacrament, and so is perfect vvithout carnall copulation.</p>
                  <p>For as their owne Canus saith:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sanctus spiritus &amp; sacramenti gratia, per coitum non datur.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Canus, lib. 8. de locis theol. c, 5. p. 246.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The holie ghost and grace of sacrament, is not giuen by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Fourthly, it followeth hereupon, that matrimonie is not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie perfect in the popish Church, because copulation followeth a good while after.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Fiftly, because it is absurd to say, that it beginneth to be a sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by carnall copulation, and was not a sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by the priests action.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Sixtly, it followeth hereupon, that the marriage betweene the blessed Virgin and S. Ioseph was not perfect matrimonie: For there doubtlesse wanted popish carnall copulation.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Seauenthly, it follovveth hereupon. that there was not perfect matrimonie betweene Adam and Eue: For their matrimonie was in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1677:42"/>
the state of innocencie, and before all carnall copulation.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 Eightly, because if matrimonie be not <hi>de iure divine</hi> before copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation: there is no cause why both parties agreeing together, may not release the bargaine, and quite dissolue the contracte. For as the <note place="margin">Vide Victor. de potest. pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae. p. 128. &amp; Soto, in 4. dist. 27. p. 48.</note> law saith: <hi>Quisque potest suo iuri cedere:</hi> Euery man may yeelde vp his right: vvhich thing all, both canonistes and devines, admit for good <hi>in sponsalibus.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>The</hi> 3. <hi>Conclusion.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>AS the pope pronounceth, that matrimonie dissolved by vertue of his dispensation, vvhich remaineth true and perfect matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie by Christes institution: So doth hee likevvise pronounce by like dispensation that to be true and perfect matrimonie, which both by the law devine, and law of nature, is no matrimonie at all. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of this assertiue proposition, is proued in the conclusion go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing next before. For probation of the second part, I make this suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall: that the pope hath dispensed vvith brothers in the marriages of their brothers vviues, as the vvorld right vvell knoweth to be true.</p>
                  <p>This supposall made, I proceed in this manner. The lavv of Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses vvas partly iudiciall, partly ceremoniall, and partly morall. The iudiciall and ceremoniall partes vvere abrogate by Christes passion, as vvitnesseth Saint Paule in these vvords: <hi>Translato sacerdotio, necesse</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Heb. c. 7. v. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>est vt &amp; legts translatio fiat.</hi> Translation of priesthood being made, there must also be translation of the lavv: but the morall and part natural is stil in force, in so much as al Christians are this day bound to keepe the decalogue: notvvithstanding the translation of the law of Moises, euen as vvere the Gentiles before the said lavv vvas giuen. For the gentiles vvere as much bound before the lavv, and we novv after the law: to absteine from Idolatrie, theft, adulterie, &amp; the rest, as were the Iews in time of the law. For as Victoria hath wel obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the gospell is called the law of libertie, because Christians after promulgation of the gospel, are only bound to the lavv of nature: of all such thinges as are conteined in the old lavv: and all devines are of the same opinion, as vvitnesseth the said Victoria in these vvords: <hi>Receptissimum est apudomnes theologos, &amp; necessarium est it a tenere, ex omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus precept is veteris legis, sola moralia integra &amp; firma restitissein nova lege.</hi> It <note place="margin">Victor. de ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trim. sect. 2. relect. 7. p. 280</note> is a generall opinion approved of all divines: and it is necessatie so to hold, that of all precepts in the old law onely morall abode firme &amp; intier in the nevv lavv. Thus then is it plaine, that that part of Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses lavv vvhich is moral, or natural, abideth still in full strength and vertue. To vvhich I must ad two thinges, for the exact and perfect probation of this my third conclusion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The one, that the lavv of nature is immutable, and indispensable by the power of man: and consequently, that the pope cannot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense thervvith. The other, that al the lavves prohibited in the 18. of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1677:43"/>
Leviticus, especiallly that of marying the brothers wife, are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and prohibited by the lawe of nature. For the former parte, Victoria writeth in this manner. <hi>In hoc genere decretorum aut Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Victor. relect. 4 de potest. papae, prop. 1. pag. 126.</note> 
                     <hi>papa nihil potest immutare dispensando, &amp; multominus abrogando. Conclusio est omnium theologorum absque controversia, &amp; potest brevitèr probari, quia ius naturale est immutabile, &amp; ut legitur in decretis, naturale ius semper permanet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this kinde of decrees or Canons, the Pope can chaunge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by dispensation, and much lesse by abrogation. It is the conclusion of all divines without any controversie, and it may be prooved briefely, because the lawe of nature is immutable, and as it is in the decrees, the lawe of nature abideth alwayes. Thomas Aquinas confirmeth the same in these wordes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sed praecepta decalogi sunt de iure naturali, ideo nec in eis nec in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijs,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Aquin. in lib. 3. sent. dist. 37. art. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>prout vim eorum continent, licet alicui homini dispen sare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the precepts of the decaloge are of the law of nature, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no man can dispense either with them or with others, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine the force thereof. And the Popes famous archbishop Autoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus telleth his holinesse flatly, that his fullnesse of power doeth in no case extend it selfe, to the law divine or law of nature. These are his wordes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quantum verò ad illa quae sunt de iure naturali vel divino, iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdictio seu potest as papalis non se extendit: sic vero quod ista possit mutare,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Antoninus de potest. papae, part 4. tit. 22. cap. 3. par. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>vel etiam dare eis vim obligandi: &amp; ratio est, quia infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior non potest mutare leges superioris: deus autem est superior ad papa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning those things which are of the law of nature, or law divine, iurisdiction or papall power doth not extend it selfe: so to wit that the Pope can change these things, or giue power obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive unto them: and the reason is, because an inferiour can not change the lawes of his superiour, and God is the Popes superiour. <note place="margin">I deeme he be in verie deed.</note> Thus then haue I prooved evidently by the Popes owne doctours, that the Pope can not dispense with the law divine, or with the lawe of nature. It remaineth that I likewise proove, the lawes prohibited in Leviticus to be the lawes of nature: and consequently, indispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sable by the power of man. First therefore, it is written in the selfe same chapter after the prohibition of the said degrees, in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>Nec polluamini in omnibus his, quibus contaminatae sunt universae gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Levit. 18. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>quas ego eijciam ante conspectum vestrum, &amp; quibus polluta est terra, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius ego scelera visitabo, ut evomat habitatores suos.</hi> Be ye not polluted in al these things with which all nations are defiled, whom I will cast out before your sight, &amp; with which the earth is polluted, whose iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties I will visite, that it may vomit out the inhabitants thereof. By which words we see evide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly, that the breach of these lawes was wic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ked &amp; unlawfull amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g the Gentiles: &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sequently, that the Gentils
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1677:43"/>
marrying vvithin degrees here prohibited, transgressed the lavve of nature. For they beeing free from all other lavves, could not bee polluted by the breach of any lavve, save onelie of the lawe of nature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Secondly, euerie one knoweth, and can easilie discerne by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall discourse, that a brother to marrie his owne sister, is against the la vve of nature: and yet doth Thomas Aquinas affirme, that there is like prohibition in affinitie.</p>
                  <p>His vvords be these.</p>
                  <p>Naturall propinquitie (saith he) cometh <hi>alio modo per carnalem co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulam,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Aquinas in 4. sent. dist. 4. ar. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>quae est etiam actus naturae adgenerationem ordinatus, &amp; exhac causatur affinitas, quae quidem impedit matrimonium eisdem rationi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, quibus &amp; consanguinitas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Naturall propinquitie commeth another vvay by carnall copu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, vvhich is an acte of nature ordeined to generation: and of this is caused affinitie, vvhich verilie prohibiteth Matrimonie by the selfe same reasons by vvhich consanguinity doth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Thirdlie, because manie late popish writers doe affirme the same.</p>
                  <p>Victoria hath these vvords:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Aliqui, vt Archiepi scopus Florent.</hi> 3. <hi>p. tit.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. &amp; <hi>Palud. in</hi> 4. <note place="margin">Victor. relict. 4. de potest. papae, pag. 129. ad, 2.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Some, as Archbishop of Florence, and Paludanus seeme to hold that the pope can not dispense, in any of the degrees pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in Leviticus: And this opinion Sylvester thinketh more probable:</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Fourthly, because the common opinion of the Fathers was, that all degrees prohibited in the said Leviticus, are prohibited now by the lavv devine. VVhich Iosephus Angles constantly avoucheth to be so, in these vvords.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Duae sunt opiniones, prima omnium fere antiquorum, qui affirmabant omnes gradus in Levit. prohibitos, esse etiam nunc iure divino prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>There be twoo opinions:</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The first was of all the olde vvriters some fevv excepted, vvho affirmed that all degrees prohibited in Leviticus, are novv also prohibited by the lavv devine. This vvas the opinion of Saint Bonaventure, of Thomas, of Richardus, and of Durand, vvith
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1677:44"/>
whom Sylvester tooke part, affirming that the pope can not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense vvith degrees prohibited in Leviticus.</p>
                  <p>This then is true not onely by the scriptures, but euen by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of the popes owne doctors, and by the vniforme consent of approved antiquitie.</p>
                  <p>Absurd therefore is Cardinall Allens opinion, and most disloyall <note place="margin">Allens vvords disloiall.</note> are his speeches: when he in his apologie for the seminaries, iustifieth Iames Laborne his opinion against the premisses.</p>

                  <head>The fourth Conclusion.</head>
                  <p>THE popes dispensations are as generall as vngodly: his corrupt vassals dailie gaping and expecting, vvho will aske dispensations for euery iote in the law. This conclusion though strange to many mens cogitations, shall be proved by the constant assertion of the best learned popish doctor.</p>
                  <p>Thus therefore writeth Victoria.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Videmus quotidie a Romana curiatam largas, imo omnino tam disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutas</hi>

                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>And in another place, the said Victoria saith thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sed clamat experientia in contrarium, &amp; videmus quodnullus quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit dispensationes, quin obtineat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But experience exclameth to the contrarie: and wee see that no man seeketh for dispensations, but hee atteineth the same.</p>
                  <p>And in another place he saith thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ego nullam dispen sationem in particulari condemno, sed video duo: primum, quod in fine anni sunt tot dispensationes factae, vt nescio an sint</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I condemne no dispensation in particular, but I see two thinges: First, that in the end of the yeare there are so many dispensations gotten, as I know not if so many keepe the law. Secondly, I see all <note place="margin">Loe, for spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual livings &amp; matrimonie, and such like, dispensations are never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.</note> that aske bring dispensations, whom I marvell if they all haue law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full causes, that they may be dispensed withall, in the impediments of matrimonie, and of irregularitie, and for the pluralitie of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall livings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:1677:44"/>
And in another place the said Victoria hath these words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Et paultim adhanc intemperantiam dispensationum deventum est, &amp; hunc talem statum, vbi necmala nostra nec remedia pati possumus,</hi>

                     <hi>&amp; ideo necesse est aliam rationem excogitare adconservandas leges. Da mihi Clementes, Linos, Sylvestros, &amp; omniapermittam arbitrio eorum. Sed vt nihil gravius dicatur in recentiores pontifices, certe multis par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus sunt priscis illis inferiores.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By Title and litle wee are brought to these in ordinate dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to this so miserable state, where we are neitherable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure our owne griefes, nor remedies a sligned for the same. And therefore must vve perforce inuent some other way, for conferuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the lawes. Giue mee Clements, Lines, Silvesters: and I will commit all things vnto their charge. But to speake nothing grievous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against these latter popes: they are doubtlesse inferiour to popes of old time, by many degrees. I could all eage many other testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: But this Victoria being of great credit among the papistes, is a most sufficient witnesse in their owne proceedinges.</p>

All vvhich sayings, Christ spoke and vttered of and to his apostles all, as vvell as to Peter: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them al apostles, as wel as Peter. And as they vvere all apostles as vvel as Peter, so had they all equall povver, not onely of order, but <note place="margin">Mat. 10. v. 1. Mark. 3 v. 14. Luc. 6. v. 14.

                     <hi>Adofficium Apostolatus, spectat potestas ordinis &amp; iurisdictionis.</hi>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1677:45"/>
and of iurisdiction. And S. Cyprian decideth this matter in most plaine and evident words, when he saith thus:</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>Covarruvias their famous Canonist, albeit he would very gladly defend the Popes pretended power, and have onely Peters power ordinarie and independent: yet can he not denie our Saviour Christ to have given equall power to all the Apostles. These be his very words:</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>For according to the auctorities of Catholike writers, and the common tradition of all, the Apostles received from our Lord Iesus Christ himselfe, equall power with Peter, both of power and iurisdiction: in so much dout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, as every Apostle had equall power with Peter from God himselfe, and that both over all the worlde, and to all actions that Peter could doe.</p>
                  <p>Out of which testimonies I note first, that all the Apostles had equall <note place="margin">1</note> auctoritie with Peter. I note secondly, that all the Apostles had power <note place="margin">2</note> over all the world, even as Peter had. I note thirdly, that what acte so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <note place="margin">3</note> Peter could doe, every other Apostle could doe the same. I note fourthly, that the iurisdiction of every Apostle, did extende as farre as Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. <note place="margin">4</note> I note fiftly, that Christs speaches to Peter in the singular number, <note place="margin">5</note> did not argue superioritie of iurisdiction: but did onely signifie the vnitie of his Church. I note sixtly, that all this is confirmed by the opinion of <note place="margin">6</note> Catholike writers, &amp; by tradition of all generally. For all these sixe points are expressely conteined, (if they be well marked,) in the auctorities alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die alledged. The same are confirmed by the testimonie of S.

                  <p>In an other place, the same S. Augustine writeth in this manner: <note place="margin">Aug. in lib. de agone Christ. cap. 30. tom. 3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ecclesiae catholicae personam sustinet Petrus, &amp; cum ei dicitur ad</hi>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:1677:46"/>
                     <hi>omnes dicitur; amas me, pasce oves meas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Peter representeth the person of the Catholike Church, and when it is said to him, it is said to all: Lovest thou me, feede my sheepe.</p>
                  <p>So then, that text of Scripture, which with the Papists is the foundation of popish primacie, to wit, Feede my sheepe: maketh no more for Peters superioritie, then it doth for the supremacie of other Apostles. For as you have heard out of S. Augustine, it was as well spoken to all, as to Peter. Yea, the grosse imagination of papists, concerning the building of the Church vpon Peter, is lively and evidently confuted of S. Augustine in an other place, where he thus writeth:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tu es inquit Petrus, &amp; super hanc Petram quam confessus es, super</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thou art Peter saith Christ, and vpon this rocke which thou hast con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, vpon this rocke which thou hast acknowledged, saying, Thou art Christ the Sonne of the living God, will I build my Church: that is, vpon my selfe the Sonne of the living God, will I build my Church. I will builde thee vpon my selfe, but not my selfe vpon thee.</p>
                  <p>Marke well these wordes, (gentle Reader,) with the other last rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed out of Saint Augustine: and doubtlesse, if plaine and manifest exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Scripture will content thy minde, thou canst not but nowe have thy desire. The great generall Councell of Constantinople, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Church of Constantinople equall in Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, with the Church of Rome. These be the words:</p>

                  <p>We renewing the Canons which were set downe by the 150. holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, assembled in this royal citie, &amp; by the 630. fathers gathered together in Chalcedon: doe define, that the See of Constantinople have equall pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges with the See of old Rome, and that it excell as Rome in Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall affaires, beeing the second after Rome.</p>
                  <p>And long before all this, that famous Councell of Nice distributing circuits, and assigning determinate iurisdictions to the Patriarchall seates, appointed to the Church of Rome prefixed limits, as to the rest. These be the wordes:</p>

                  <p>By which wordes we see evidently, that this auncient and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Councell maketh no other account of the Church of Rome, then it doeth of other Patriarchall seates. Which Ruffinus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, though reputed a great Papist, hath confessed bountifully in these wordes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vt apud Alexandriam vel in vrbe Roma vetusta consuetudo ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetur,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>That the old custome may continue, and that the Bishop of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria may have the charge of Egypt, as the Bishop of Rome hath charge of the Churches nigh to Rome.</p>
                  <p>Loe, in Ruffinus his dayes, the Bishop of Rome had his iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on limited, which extended onely to certaine speciall Churches of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie. For which cause Saint Hierome, a deare friend and great favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the Church of Rome, confessed for all that, the Bishop of Rome to be of no greater merite, excellencie, or auctoritie, then other Bishops are: as also that the custome of Rome, could not over-rule other Churches.</p>
                  <p>These are S. Hieromes owne and expresse wordes:</p>

                     <hi>sive Romae, sive Eugubij, sive Constantinopoli, sive Rhegij, sive Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andriae, sive Tanis: eiusdem meriti, eiusdem est &amp; sacerdotij.</hi>
                     <pb n="76" facs="tcp:1677:47"/>
                     <hi>potentia divitiarum &amp; paupertatis humilitas, vel sublimiorem vel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriorem Epi scopum facit, caeterùm omnes Apostolorum successores sunt. Sed dicis, quomodo Romae adtestimonium diaconi presbyter ordinatur? quid mihi profers vnius vrbis consuetudinem?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we looke for authoritie, the world is greater then one citie. Where so ever a bishop shall be, whether at Rome, or at Eugubium, or at Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople, or at Rhegium, or at Alexandria, or at Tanis; he is of the same merite, and of the same priesthoode. The magnificence of riches, &amp; the basenes of povertie, doth make him higher or lower, but all are the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessours of the Apostles. But thou wilt say, how is a priest made at Rome by the testimonie of a Deacon? why doest thou alleadge vnto me the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of one onely citie?</p>
                  <p>Thus S. Hierome agreeth with Ruffinus, Ruffinus with the Councell of Nice, and the Councell of Nice with other Councels, fathers, &amp; Scriptures. And all ioyntly conclude the equalitie of other Bishops and Churches, with the Bishop and Church of Rome.</p>

                  <head>The second Conclusion.</head>
                  <p>ALL the Apostles received their vniversall power immediately from Christ, and not from Peter at all; and consequently, their iurisdictions were no lesse ordinarie then Peters was. This to be so, (though this day much impugned by the Papists,) prooveth a great popish Doctour Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciscus a Victoria, in these words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Omnem potestatem quam Apostoli habuerunt, receperunt immedia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tè</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>All power which the Apostles had, they received it immediately from Christ.</p>
                  <p>And in an other place, the said Victoria hath these words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lex iniusta Episcopi non obligat, ergo nec Papae. Antecedens est no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>

                     <hi>&amp; concessum ab omnibus; &amp; consequentia videtur not a, quia no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> habet maiorem auctoritatem Papa adinferendum iniuriam, quam Episcopus; circa ea enim quae sunt sui officij, &amp; in proprios subditos, non minus potest quàm Papa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The vniust law of the Bishop doth not binde a man, <hi>ergo</hi> neither doth the vniust lawe of the Pope binde a man. The antecedent is knowne and graunted of all, and the consequence seemeth manifest, because the Pope hath no more auctoritie to doe an iniurie, then hath the Bishop. For in those things which perteine to his office, and to his proper subiects, he can doe as much as the Pope.</p>
                  <p>Loe, this great learned Papist, who for his learning is reverenced of all Papists in the world, ascribeth no lesse auctoritie to every Bishop in his dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1677:47"/>
then to the Pope himselfe. Againe, he affirmeth that no bishops au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie is dependent vpon the Pope, but is immediately from Christ: so that papistrie is still confuted and confounded by it selfe, and that by the best doctours of greatest authoritie, even in the Church of Rome. Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus Angles, though otherwise he flatter the Pope and advance his aucto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, yet hath Gods Spirit enforced him to testifie the same truth. These are his wordes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Si comparemus B. Petri &amp; aliorum Apostolorum potestatem ad guber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationem</hi>

                     <hi>omnium credentium, tantam alij Apostoli habuerunt potesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, quantam B. Petrus habuit, it a quod poterant quemlibet Christianum totius orbis, sicut modo Rom.

Petro promissa &amp; tradita, fuit &amp; caeteris Apostolis collata, &amp; hoc sine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonarum, loci, vel fori discrimine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we compare the power of S. Peter and of the other Apostles, to the government of all the faithfull: other Apostles have even as much power as S. Peter had, so that they could then excommunicate every Christian in the whole world, as the Bishop of Rome doth now, and also make Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Priests in every Church. The reason is, because all power pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised and given to S. Peter, was also given to the rest of the Apostles, and that without difference of persons, place, or consistorie.</p>
                  <p>This is the sentence of fiyer Ioseph, who vnwittingly and vnwillingly <note place="margin">Magna est ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valet, 3. Esdrae 4. 42.</note> (such is the force of veritie,) doeth wonderfully advance the trueth, even while he seeketh to oppugne the same.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 For first, he graunteth that every Apostle had as much auctoritie as S. Peter.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Secondly, that every Apostle had then as much auctoritie, as the Pope chalengeth now.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Thirdly, that every Apostle had auctoritie from Christ, to create Priests and Bishops every where.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Fourthly, that all this their authoritie was given them, without diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of person, place, or consistorie.</p>
                  <p>O mercifull God, blessed be thy holy Name for ever: such is the maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie of thy holy Gospell, that the enemies thereof iustly infatuated for their sinnes, doe vnwares even then illustrate thy trueth, when they thinke the most to obscure the same. This I did not see, O God, when I was aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned from thee: this I nowe behold, O God, when thou of thy mercy hast called me to thee. Graunt, O sweete Father, that all seduced Papistes may behold the same with me, to the glorie of thy holy Name, the honour of thy Church, and the eternall solace of their owne soules. For more then the Popes owne deare doctours doe teach vs, we desire not at the Popes hands. The generall Councels of Constance and Basil, decreed this matter in these manifest tearmes:</p>

                  <p>Thus saith the Councell, and doubtlesse where power commeth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from Christ, it can not be derived from the Pope. Thirdly, S. Paul had speciall auctoritie over the Gentiles, and largely as much as Peter, if not more: and consequently, since all Christians now, were Gentiles then: the Pope if he will needes have superioritie over his brethren Bishops, must reduce his succession from S. Paul. For thus saith S. Paul of himselfe: <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>KInges have power coactive over Popes, but Popes have no coactive power over Kings: albeit Popes of late dayes, have not onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated Princes, but deposed them also. For proofe of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, many texts of holy Scripture are consonant. King Salomon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Abiathar, and placed Sadock in his roome. For so the booke of Kings saith:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abiathar quoque sacerdoti dixit rex, vade in Anathoth ad agrum tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Then the King said to Abiathar the priest, goe to Anathoth vnto thine owne farme, for thou art worthie to die, but I will not this day kill thee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou barest the Arke of the Lord God before David my father, and because thou hast suffered in all where my father hath beene afflicted. Salomon therefore cast out Abiathar from beeing priest vnto the Lord, and set Sadock the priest in the roome of Abiathar.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Amarias the Priest and your Bishop, shall beare rule in those thinges which perteine to God: and Zabadias sonne of Ismael captaine in the house of Iuda, shall be over those workes which belong to the office of the King.</p>
                  <p>These are the expresse words of holy Scripture, which I have alleadg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at large, because if they be once applied effectually, they can not but proove my opinion fully.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 First therefore, as the Queenes most excellent Maiestie that nowe is, appointeth Bishops and Priests: so king Iosaphat appointed Priestes and Levites, so king Salomon appointed Sadock.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Secondly, as her Maiestie deposeth Priests: so king Salomon deposed Abiathar.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Thirdly, as her Maiestie commandeth her Bishops in Englande: to preach the Gospell, to administer the Sacraments, to reforme abuses, and to execute censures Ecclesiasticall according to the Scriptures: so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded king Iosaphat his Priests in Ierusalem: to decide all controversies arising about the lawe, about commandements, about ceremonies, about iustifications, and to teach his people their duetie therein.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Fourthly, as king Iosaphat appointed Amarias ruler in spiritual causes, and Zabadias governour in secular affaires, distinguishing their offices, and limiting their iurisdictions: so doth her Maiestie referre Ecclesiasticall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres to her cleargie men, and matters of state to her secular lords, neither confounding their functions, nor disabling their persons.</p>

                  <p>

                  <p>Hee might more probably have saide, that a woman was once Pope to Romish Iesuits his brethren.

For I am lord over all others, and in respect of my magnificence, whatsoever doth please me, seemeth to be lawfull for me.</p>
                  <p>Raynerius Snoygoudanus and divers others, have set downe the like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, vpon this portion of Scripture. The popish glosse vpon the same text, hath these words:</p>

                  <p>Nicolaus Lyranus a man of no small account with the papists, glosseth the said text in this manner:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tibi solipeccavi, scilicet tanquam iudici &amp; punire potenti. pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verat</hi>

                  <p>To thee onely have <hi>I</hi> sinned: that is to say, to thee onely as to the iudge and him that can punnish. For he had no we sinned against Vrias and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, whom he caused to be murdered by that occasion: but because he was a King, he had no superiour iudge that could punnish him, save God alone.</p>
                  <p>What can be more plainly spoken? for if none but God be superiour to the King? if none but God can iudge the King? if none but God ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> punish the King? (all which the Popes owne doctours affirme, then doubtles, can not the Pope depose the King. The King therefore by popish resolution, is greater and above the Pope. Yea, which is wonderful: Thomas Aquinas, who is as it were the platforme and patterne, or <hi>Idaea:</hi> according to which the Popes of late yeares doe fashion and frame their lawes, and whose do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is as the Gospell with the Papists, doth confirme Lyra his expositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in these words:</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>To thee onely have I sinned. the glosse saith, the King hath no man, that can iudge his doings: but yet touching the directive force of the lawe, the Prince is subiect of his owne accord vnto the law.</p>
                  <p>Which Victoria vttereth wisely and learnedly, in these words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Leges latae à rep. obligant omnes, ergo etiam sifer antur à rege, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Lawes which the common-weale maketh, binde all: therefore if the King make them, they binde him also. And it is confirmed, because in the aristocraticall government, the lawes of the senate binde the fenatours the auctors thereof: and in popular regiment, the decrees of the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple binde the people: <hi>ergo</hi> in like manner, the kings laws binde the king. And although the king make lawes voluntarie, yet is it not in his will to be bound or vnbound, as in covenants: for every one maketh covenants vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily, and yet is every one bound by his covenants.</p>
                  <p>Ambrose who freeth Kings from all lawes made by man, shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this point. Thus doth he write:</p>
                  <p>

They that are bound to lawes, dare denie their sinne, and disdaine to aske forgivenesse: which he desired, that was bound to no law of man.</p>
                  <p>And againe, he saith:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rex vtique erat, nullis ipse legibus tenebatur: neque enim vllis adpoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>He was in deede a king, he was bound to no lawes: for kings beeing free by the power of Empyre, are not punnished by any lawes. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore finned not to man, to whome he was not subiect.</p>
                  <p>Most impudent therefore and intollerable, is the Popes insolencie: when he exalteth himselfe above Kings and Emperours, threatning them that he can depose them from their scepters and regalties, and dispossesse them of their Empires and dominions. Which for all that, Cardinall Allen is not ashamed to avovch with lying lippes, in the Popes behalfe: in that his disloyall pamphlet, which he published without name in defense of the Seminaries. But such flatterie of feyned titles, a Pope of famous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie shall confute. Gregorie surnamed the great, himselfe beeing Pope of Rome: at what time as he was appointed by Mauricius the Emperour, to publish a certaine law sent him from the Emperour: did not refuse to accomplish the said Emperours assignment, but acknowledged him by duetie bound to execute his commandement therein: albeit he thought the law in some part: disagreeable to Gods will. This to be so, the Popes owne words shall witnesse, which be these:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ego quidem iussioni subiectus, eandem legem per diversas terra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I subiect to your commandement, have caused the same law to be sent through diverse parts of the lande: and because the lawe doth not agree with Gods will: behold, I have intimated so much vnto your Maiestie by my epistle: I have therefore discharged my duetie in both respects, as who have yielded my obedience vnto the Emperour, neither concealed what I thought, in Gods behalfe.</p>
                  <p>These are the Popes words, besides many others in the same epistle, to the like effect. Which being vttered by the chiefest Pope, are most effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to proove the subiection of Popes vnto Kings.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 For first, Pope Gregorie acknowledgeth the Emperour, to be his lord.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Secondly, he confesseth him selfe to be the Emperours subiect.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Thirdly, he graunteth that he oweth loyall obedience to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour: for which duetie, he durst not but publish the Emperours law, though in some part, it were very rigorous: and that least he should have bin guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of distoyaltie towards his Prince.</p>

Now that Romish pontificalitie, and pompe of Poperie, came vp first by beggerly Canonists: who to advance them selves, flattered the Pope, and gave him more then princely titles: the Popes owne deare Doctour, (who carieth therefore credite on his backe,) telleth vs, who after he hath rehearsed many lordly titles, and more then royall power, ascribed to the Pope: hath these expresse words;</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>But the glossers of the Popes law, gave this dominion (and these royall titles) vnto the Pope, when them selves were blind bayards, and beggerly fellowes.</p>
                  <p>Thus saith the Popes Doctour: and thus we see, that povertie and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, were the beginning of Pope dome.

The latter part hereof, Victoria sheweth in these wordes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secundus titulus qui praetenditur, &amp; quidem vehementer asseritur ad instam possessionem il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larum</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The second title which is pretended, and earnestly affirmed, for the iust possession of those provinces, consisteth in the Popes graunt. For say they, the Pope is a temporall Monarch, even of the whole worlde: and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that he could appoint the Kings of Spaine Princes over those Barbarians, and so it came to passe.</p>
                  <p>The former part of the conclusion, Aquinas prooveth in these wordes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ad Ecclesiam autem non pertinet punire infidelitatem in illis, qui</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>But it belongeth not to the Church, to punnish infidelitie in them,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1677:51"/>
who never received the saith, according to that saying of the Apostle; What have I to doe to iudge of those, that be not in the Church.</p>
                  <p>Dominicus Soto is of the same opinion, whose words are these: <note place="margin">Soto in 4. dist. 5. ar. 10. in med. art.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ad hoc autem respondetur, in primis Pontificem neque concessisse, imò vero neque (vt cum omni reverentia &amp; obedientia de sanctissimo Christi vicario loquar,) concedere potuisse eorum suorumve honorum do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minium, quasi dominium in eos ipse haberet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to this I answer, (be it spoken with all reverence and obedience to the most holy Vicar of Christ) that neither the Pope did graunt, yea neither could he graunt vnto the King of Spaine, dominion over those Indians or their goods: as though himselfe had dominion over them.</p>
                  <p>It followeth in the same Soto:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lex fidei dominium rerum ab infidelibus non aufert, quod sibi natur a concessit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The law of faith doth not take away dominion of possessions from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, which nature hath graunted them.</p>
                  <p>Victoria accordeth to Aquinas and Soto, in these words: <note place="margin">Victor. in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. 5. de In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, pag. 193.</note>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Ex quo patet, quodnec iste titulus est idoneus contrabarbaros, vel quia Papa dederit provincias illas tanquam dominus absolute, vel quia non recognoscent dominium Papae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereby it is plaine, that neither this title is sufficient against the barbarians: either because the Pope gave those Provinces, as beeing absolute lord thereof: or for that they doe not recognize, the Popes au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie.</p>

                  <p>For this cause he can not give any Christian king auctoritie, to vsurpe the kingdomes of the Indians to himselfe: for he is not the temporall lord of the world.</p>

                  <p>But doubtlesse, hee wrought not mans redemption perfectlie, if mans satisfaction must concurre to the perfection thereof: and yet concurre it must perforce if another purgation be established in purgatorie fire, besides that purgation which Christes bloud hath wrought.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Fiftly, because Christes satisfaction otherwise had bene in vaine. For if we can satisfy for our selves, or by the help of our neighbors in purgatorie fire: then did Christ in vaine satisfy for vs vpon the Crosse: then did not Christ loose both the sinne &amp; paine of sinne, as Saint Augustine avoucheth.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Sixtly, because our satisfaction speaking of the best, is not, nor can be infinite: and consequently, cannot make compensation for infinite transgression.</p>
                  <p>For as Aquinas saith:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peccatum contra Deum admissum, quandam infinit atem habet ex infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Sinne committed against God is infinite, by reason of his infinite Maiestie: For so much is the offence greater, by how much he is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter against whom we sinne.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Seventhly, because it is flatly against the opinions of the holy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Thus saith Saint Augustine:</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The faith of Catholikes by Gods auctoritie, beleeueth the first place to be the kingdom of heaven: the second place to be hell, wher euery apostate or infidell shall bee punished euerlastingly: the third place we are vtterly ignorant of neither shall we find it in the holy scriptures.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:1677:54"/>
which assertion saint Augustine doth often inculcate, in sundrie of his bookes. Saint Hierome likewise teacheth vs, that after the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the soule from the bodie, there is no resting place, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther heaven or hell. These are his words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quum anima vinculis laxata corporis, volandi quo velit, sive quo iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>VVhen the soule shall bee leused from corporall bondes, and shall have liberte to goe whither it will, or whither it is compelled to goe: either it shall bee brought to the infernall spirites, of whom it is written, ïn hell who will confesse vnto thee? or doubtlesse it shall be exalted to heaven aboue. To conclude, their famous bishop and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly martyr Roffensis, confessing the late originall of popish pardons, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other reasons, yeldeth this for one:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quarum prima est, quodolim non erat vsque adeo ecclesiae notum purgatorium. Imo Graecis inquit, adhunc vsque diem non est credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi>

                  <p>whereof the first reason is, that in old time, purgatorie was not so well knowen vnto the church. yea saith he; the Greekes do not to this day beleeue it.</p>
                  <p>And doubtlesse, if there were anie purgatorie besides Christs pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the thiefe that lived wickedly to the last houre, should have had his part therein; who yet went incontinently to paradise, as saith <note place="margin">Luc. c. 23. v. 43.</note> the holie scripture.</p>

                  <p>Correspondent hereunto, is this saying of Aquinas:</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>we must answere, that to merit &amp; demerit, perteine to the state of the way: wherefore, good workes are meritorious to suche

                  <p>But in the saintes of heaven good vvorkes are not meritorious, but appertaine to the reward of their beatitude.</p>
                  <p>And in like manner euill workes in the damned are not demeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious, but perteine to the paine of their damnation.</p>
                  <p>Dominicus Soto commenting vpon the maister of sentences, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the selfe same opinion.

So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in 4. dist. 19 quaest. 3. ar. 1, ad arg. 1.</note> vs to doe good, <hi>dum tempus habemus,</hi> while wee haue time.</p>
                  <p>This the preacher confirmeth in these words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Viventes sciunt quod morientur, &amp; mortui nesciunt quicquam, &amp; non est eis amplius merces, in oblivione enim est memoria eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi>

                  <p>The living know that they must die, and the dead know nothing at all, neither haue they henceforth a rewarde, for their memorie is forgotten.</p>
                  <p>Vppon which wordes saint Hierome hath this glosse:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Viventes metu mortis possunt bona operaperpetrare, mortui uero nihil</hi>

                  <p>The living may doe good woorkes for feare of death: but the dead can ad nothing to that, which they once tooke with them out of this life. Their loue also and their hatred, their emulation, and what soeuer they could haue in this world, all is ended with death. For they can neither doe well nor sinne, neither addevice nor vertue.</p>

                  <p>There is no other place but this life to reforme our manners: For after this life everie one shall have that, which hee purchased for himselfe in this life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="93" facs="tcp:1677:55"/>
many other like sayinges the said holie father hath to the like effect and purpose: which I now let passe with silence, thinking that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient which is alreadie said hereof.</p>
                  <p>Most miserable therefore are the soules in popish purgatorie, as who by popish doctrine can neither merite nor satisfie for their sinnes.</p>
                  <p>For if soules in purgatorie can satisfy or merit, then can they also demerite, (because the selfe same reason holdeth in both alike,) and if they can demerite, they can also sinne mortally, and so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish eternallie, contrarie to popish doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Again, if any mercie can be found after this life: the reason made by saint Paul to the Corinthians which was grounded vpon the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest misterie of our Christian faith is doubtlesse of no force at all: to wit, when hee concludeth of the faith vpon Christ his resurrection from the dead.</p>
                  <p>Thus standeth the Apostles discourse: they that die in the faith of Christ, are either saved or damned: who if they be saved, then is <note place="margin">Infra cap. 9. per totum.</note> Christ risen againe, and become a true saviour: but if they be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: then doubtlesse is Christ not risen againe, neither become a true saviour. Now to confesse a thirde place, where soules remaine neither saved or damned, but in a perplexe manner, that indeed may stand with popish doctrine, but is flatte against Saint Paules dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
                  <p>Againe, to hold a third place doth overthrovv another of Saint Paules reasons, when he affirmeth the being in this bodie, to keepe the faithfull from Christ.</p>
                  <p>For if popish purgatorie be admitted, the soules suffering there shall be as well absent from Christes presence, as when they were in <note place="margin">2. Cor. 5. v. 7. 8.</note> Christes bodie.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps, saint Paul knew not how to conclude his purpose, or at least was not in love with papistrie. Yet the papistes will say, that it is verie common with the fathers to pray for the dead.</p>
                  <p>To this I say, that in verie deede it cannot be denied, but that sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie of the fathers have both praied themselues for the dead, and haue also approved the praiers of others to the like end. But this will neither establish the popish purgatorie, nor their manner of praying for the dead.</p>
                  <p>VVhich obiection, because it seemeth to carrie a great maiestie with it, and indeede seduceth many a one, (as which is plainly set downe in verie expresse termes, in many places of the auncient wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,) I purpose a litle to stand vpon it, nothing doubting but to satisfy the indifferent reader therewith through the power of God, so he will yeeld attentiue eares vnto my words.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 I therefore say first, (as is proved elswhere in this treatise,) that <note place="margin">1. Cor. c. 15. v. 17. 18.</note>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:1677:56"/>
what writer so euer affirmeth any doctrine, contrarie to that which is taught in the holy scriptures: he who soeuer he be, must be reiected, and his doctrine in that point contemned.</p>
                  <p>VVhich thing I doe not barely say, but I haue prooved the same out of the doctrine of the fathers, by the flat and expresse wordes of the fathers themselues. peruse the ninth chapter, of credit to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to writers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 I say secondly, that it is a seemely, good, and godly maner, to pray for the dead: so our hearts bee rightly disposed, and our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers framed accordingly.</p>
                  <p>As for example: when it is said of some friend departed out of this life, God grant him a ioyfull resurrection: which is the most orderly and plainest forme, of praying for the dead.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>I</hi> say thirdly, if one say God have mercie vpon the soule, being wel instructed for the true sense thereof: it is not to be reproued, though the other phrase and maner of praying, ought rather to be vsed: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially in these daies, when the latter kinde is commonly abused. for albeit the holie and ancient fathers, when they prayed for rest &amp; mercie to the dead, vnderstoode nothing els but the resurrection of the bodie, and the complement that redoundeth to the soule by vnion of the same: yet haue the papistes taught, and this day teach the people to vnderstand therby, the mitigation of purgatorie pains: which the soules of the dead enioy (as they groslie imagine,) either by praiers of the faithfull, or by masses, trentals, and diriges, or by the popes pardons. So that the evill of this maner of praying, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth not in the phrase and praier it selfe: but in the erronius affection of the partie that so praieth.</p>
                  <p>For the better vnderstanding whereof, we must obserue:</p>
                  <p n="1">1 First, that it is lawfull to pray for such things, as are verie cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: but not yet accomplished or brought to passe.</p>
                  <p>And consequently, that it is lawfull to pray for the resurrection of the bodie: as also that the soules in the second advent may be vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againe to the bodies: that so the faithfull may in complete ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, be made partakers of the vision beatificall.</p>
                  <p>This observation is manifest by that praier which our saviour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe praied: whose actions, as writeth the apostle, are our instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                  <p>For our Lord Iesus praied for the salvation of his elect, who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. v. 22.</note> shall nor could perish by any possibilitie.</p>
                  <p>That he praied for them, is manifest in these wordes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Non pro mundo rogo, sedpro his quos dedisti mihi, quia tui sunt. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Iohn. c. 17. v. 9. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>sancte, seruaeos in nomine tuo, quos dedisti mihi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:1677:56"/>
I pray not for the world, but for those whom thou hast giuen me, because they are thine. holy father, keepe them in thy name, whom thou hast giuen me. Yea, the verie elect are commaunded to praye for their salvation, because that is one of the petitions in the Lords prayer, which appertaineth to all, especially to the elect.</p>
                  <p>And that the elect cannot perish, is euident by this testimonie of the holie gospel:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It a vt in errorem inducantur (sifieri potest) etiam electi:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mat. c. 24. v. 24</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that the verie elect should be seduced, if it were possible.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 vvee must obserue secondly, that in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> writinges of the fathers, sinne is often taken for the corruption and mortalitie of the bodie: as the papistes themselves doe ever in their romish pardons, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand by sinne the paine due for sinne.</p>
                  <p>which observations well remembred, all obiections out of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, touching praying for the dead, may bee answered with all fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitie. For first, when the ancient churches offered vp their sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of thankes giving, and prayers for the dead:</p>
                  <p n="2">2 And secondly, when the fathers doe desire eternall rest vnto the dead: they desire nothing lesse, then that such souls may be delivered out of purgatorie, or haue remission of their sinnes.</p>
                  <p>vvhich thing I will proue, by two verie sound foundations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The one, because such prayers or oblations were made for those, who (not only as the fathers beleeued, but euen as the papistes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves confesse) were then in heaven, where they neither needed nor could be relieved, by such praiers or oblations.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The other, because the fathers haue ackowledged so much, by expresse wordes in their writings.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The former foundation is evident in the liturgie of S. Chrisostom, <note place="margin">Chrysost. in liturg. prope finem. to. 5. p. 1377.</note> who there offered his sacrifice of thankes giuing, for the prophets, apostles, martyrs,, and for our blessed ladie the holie virgin Marie. vvhom all I am well assured, the papistes will confesse to haue beene in heauen, long afore saint Chrysostome was borne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The second foundation is plainly confessed by saint Ambrose, who in his funerall orations for the emperours Theodosius and Valenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianus with his brother Satyrus: both confesseth them to possesse eternall rest in heaven, and neverthelesse praieth for eternall rest vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
                  <p>which words, though they seeme to implie manifest contradiction: yet are they no lesse exact and sound, then godlie and easie to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood: if my rehearsed observations be well marked. For though their soules were in eternall blisse, that is, in heaven: yet neither were their bodies then, neither are they now, neither shall they be, vntill the second advent of our redeemer, in that eternal rest.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:1677:57"/>
VVhich rest that Valentinianus, Thedosius; and Satyrus may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy after the day of dome in complete maner: that is, in soule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die vnited in perpetuall vnion: Sainte Ambrose prayed so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly.</p>
                  <p>Now for thy better instruction and satisfaction, (gentle Reader,) I will alleage Saint Amhrose wordes, as himselfe hath vttered them.</p>
                  <p>Of his brother Satirus he saith thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tibi nunc omnipotens Deus innoxia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> commendo animam, tibi hostiam meam affero: cape propitius ac serenus fraternum munus, sacrificium</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>To thee now, O almightie God, I commend his innocent soule: to thee I offer my oblation, accept favourably my brotherly present, the sacrifice of thy priest.</p>
                  <p>Of Theodosius he saith thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Da requiem perfectam servo tuo Theodosio, requiem illam quam pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parasti</hi>

                     <hi>sa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctis tuis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Giue perfect rest to thy seruant Theodosius, that rest which thou hast prepared for thy saintes.</p>
                  <p>Of Valentinianus he saith thus: <note place="margin">Ambr. de o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitu Valent. p. 12. to. 3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nulla dies vos silentio preteribit, nulla inhonoratos vos mea transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit oratio, nulla nox non donatos aliqua precium mearum contextione transcurret. omnibus vos oblationibus frequentabo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No day shall passe with silence, none of mine orations shall passe without your honour, no night shall slide away without some pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of mine for you. I will frequent you with all oblations.</p>
                  <p>Thus we see plainly, that Saint Ambrose both offered sacrifice of lawde, and prayed for Valentinianus, Theodosius, and Satirus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead.</p>
                  <p>Let vs now proceed a litle further.</p>
                  <p>Thus saith saint Ambrose of Satyrus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Intravit in regnum coelorum, quoniam credidit Dei verbo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hee is entred into Heaven, because hee beleeved the word of <note place="margin">Ambt. vbi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra de sing.</note> God.</p>
                  <p>Thus saith he of Theodosius:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Manet ergo in lumine Theodosius, &amp; sanctorum caetibus gloriatur. fruitur Augustae memoriae Theodosius luce perpetua.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theodosius therefore abideth in light, and in the glorie and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of Saints. Theodosius of famous memory, enioyeth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall light.</p>
                  <p>Thus hee saith of Valentinianus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Creaimus quia ascendit a de serto, hoc est, ex hoc arido &amp; inculto loco</hi>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:1677:57"/>
                     <hi>adillas florulentas delectationes, vbi cum fratre coniunctus aeternae vitae fruitur voluptate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let vs beleeue, that he is ascended from the desert: that is, from this drie and vntilled place to those florishing delectations, wherin the fellowship of his brother hee enioyeth the pleasure of eternall life.</p>
                  <p>These wordes are plaine, and neede no glosse. Saint Ambrose then beleeved, that Valentinianus, Theodosius, and Satyrus were in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and enioied eternall rest: and neverthelesse, even then prayed for their eternall rest. But doubtlesse his praiers had beene both vaine and foolish if he should haue praied for that vnto them, which they had and enioyed alreadie. Hee therefore praied, (as my obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations declare,) not for the rest and blisse of the soules, which the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> possessed eternall rest and blisse: but that the bodies also may bee pertakers of that place and rest, which they wanted them, and shall vntill the day of dome.</p>
                  <p>And for the better confirmation of this mine assertion, saint Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose doth in expresse words so expound himselfe:</p>
                  <p>For thus he writeth:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Te quae so summe Deus, vt charissimos iuvenes matura resurrectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ambrosius vbi sup.</note> 
                     <hi>resuscites. &amp; immaturum hunc vitae istius cur sum matura resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione compenses.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O high and mightie God, I beseech thee to raise vp most deare yong youthes with mature resurrection, and to recompence the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripe course of this their life, with mature and ripe resurrection.</p>
                  <p>Loe here in plaine and briefe tearmes, the compendious expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <note place="margin">Let this be wel noted.</note> of that popish obiection, and doubt, vvhich so troubleth and seduceth many a one.</p>
                  <p>And so Saint Ambrose his prayer for the dead, was even this and no other: God give them a ioyfull resurrection.</p>

               <div n="4" type="conclusion">
                  <head>The fourth Conclusion.</head>
                  <p>IF popish purgatorie were admitted to be <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: yet would it follow by a necessarie consequent, that the soules tormented there should perish everlastingly.</p>
                  <p>This conclusion is thus proved.</p>
                  <p>There is no salvation to be expected out of the church, as witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth their great councell of Lateran, and the holie fathers accord thereunto. But soules boiling in purgatorie papisticall, bee neither in the church triumphant, because there is no neede of purgation, neither in the church militant, because there is place for merite and satisfaction: ergo they be out of the church: And consequently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1677:58"/>
the state of salvation: and in the state of eternall damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>And that the best learned papistes stand in doubt of their salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it cannot with right reason be denied. For in their Masses of Requiem, the priestes are commaunded to pray in these expresse words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ne absorbeat eas tartarus:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">In missa re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiem pro defunctis.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>That hell swallow not them vp and devoure them.</p>
                  <p>And doubtlesse, if they bee assured of their salvation: it is a vaine and ridiculous thing to pray, that they be not swallowed vp of hell: And consequently, their holie Masse is farced with a bundell of vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Neither wil it helpe the adversarie to say, that though the soules in their purgatorie can not satisfy for themselves: Yet may the living satisfy for them, which is of as much force, as if they did satisfy for themselves. For as the transgression is personall, so must the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction also bee.</p>
                  <p>The reason hereof is evident, because to accept ones satisfaction for another: may well stand with acceptation or mercie, but never with iustice.</p>
                  <p>For which iustice notwithstanding, popish purgatorie was inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and this day is defended: as their reverend professor of divinity Dominicus Soto, plainly testifyeth in these words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Respondetur, quod licet tunc moriens satisfacere nequeat, culpa sua fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it, quod tempus adid antea non elegit: &amp; ideo poena quae per contritione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     <hi>nonfuerit ei dimissa, in purgatorio est luenda: vt ratio divinae iustitiae servetur.</hi> I answere,</p>
                  <p>That although he that dieth, can not satisfy for his sins: yet was it his owne default, because he chose not before time for it: And therfore, the punishment which was not remitted by contrition and confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, must be punished in purgatorie: that the order of Gods iustice may be observed.</p>

                     <hi>The</hi> 5. <hi>Conclusion.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IT is euident even by the opinion of great papistes, that manie soules in purgatorie shall abide there for ever: and yet is that flat against popish religion.</p>
                  <p>This conclusion shall bee manifest, if I prove three pointes.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="99" facs="tcp:1677:58"/>
1 First, that everie sinne is mortall.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Secondlie, that no mortall sinne can be remitted or forgiven in popish purgatorie.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Thirdly, that many depart out of this world, not having their venial sinnes (of the papists so tearmed) before remitted, or forgiven.</p>
                  <p>For first, if everie sinne bee mortall: and secondly, if no mortall sinne be forgiven in purgatorie: and thirdly, if sundrie be in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, whose sinnes be not all forgiven: it must needes follow by a necessarie sequel, that such persons must continue in purgatorie eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nallie, because they cannot come from thence vntill their sinnes be remitted wholy.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 First therefore, that euerie sinne is mortall, is confessed by three great papistes: that is to say, Roffensis, Gersonus, and Michael Baius.</p>
                  <p>For these three confesse plainlie, that everie sinne is mortall of it owne nature, and onely veniall through Gods mercifull acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and therefore may it be iustly punished everlastinglie.</p>
                  <p>Roffensis writing against Luther, hath these expresse words. <note place="margin">Roffensis art. 32. advers. Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. pag. 328.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quod peccatum veniale solum ex Dei misericordia veniale sit, in hoc tecum sentio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That a veniall sinne is onely veniall through the mercie of God (&amp; not of it owne nature,) therein doe I agree vnto you.</p>
                  <p>Loe, my Lord of Rochester confesseth plainlie, that euerie sinne is mortall of it owne nature.</p>
                  <p>And Ioannes Gerson sometime chanceler of Paris, that famous v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersitie, though otherwise a great papist, can not denie this veritie: for these are his words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nulla offensa Dei est venialis de se, nisitantum modo per respectum ad divina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> misericordia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, qui nonvult de facto qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>libet offensam imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ioan. Gers. de vita spirituali, lect. 1. p. 3. in 1. corollar.</note> 
                     <hi>ad mortem, cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> illud posset iustissime. Et ita concluditur, quod peccatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mortale &amp; veniale in esse tali, non distinguuntur intrinsece &amp; essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliter, sed solum per respectum ad divinam gratiam, quae peccatum istud imputat ad poenam mortis, &amp; aliud non.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No offence of God is veniall of it owne nature, but onely in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of Gods mercie, who will not <hi>de facto,</hi> impute euerie offence to death, although he might most iustlie doe it.</p>
                  <p>And so I conclude, that mortal and veniall sinnes as such, are not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished intrinsecallie, and essentiallie: but onelie in respect of Gods grace, which assigneth this sinne to the paine of death, and not the other.</p>
                  <p>Manie other sentences to the like effect the said Gerson hath, but these may suffice to content anie reasonable mind.</p>

                     <pb n="100" facs="tcp:1677:59"/>
Other papistes are of the same opinion in verie deed, though they do not disclose their mindes in such manifest tearmes.</p>
                  <p>Thus writeth our father Iesuit Bellarminus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Respondeo, omne peccatum esse contra legem Dei non positivam sedae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternam, vt Aug. recte docet. omnis enim iusta lex siue a Deo, sive ab</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Bellar. de Ro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Pontif. cap. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>homine detur, ab aeterna dei lege derivatur: est enim aeterna lex, vt malum sit violare regulam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answere, that everie sinne is against the lawe of God, not posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, but eternall, as Augustine rightly teacheth. For euerie iust law, whether it be made by God or by man, is derived from the law of God eternall. For the lawe eternall is, that it is sinue to transgresse the rule.</p>
                  <p>And this is the common opinion, as I haue proved out of Iosephus Angles.</p>
                  <p>Neither will it helpe the papistes to say as the Thomistes doe: that veniall sins are <hi>praeter non contra legem,</hi> besides the law, but not against <note place="margin">Legendus est Ioseph. Ang. sup. cap. 7. ar. s</note> the law.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 First, because saint Augustine defineth sinne generallie to be a gainst the law of God, writing in this manner:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peccatum est dictum, vel factum, vel concupitum, contra legem aeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Aug. l. 22. c. 27. contra faustu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> 
                     <hi>dei.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sinne is a saying, or doing, or coveting, against Gods eternall lawe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because as Iosephus Angles their owne doctor saith: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie venial sinne is against right reason, and to doe against right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ason, <note place="margin">Ioseph. Angl. in 4. sent. part. 3. p. 215.</note> is to doe against the law of nature, which commaundeth not to depart from the rule of right reason.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Thirdly, because we must give an accompt of euerie idle word in the general day of iudgement, as Christ himselfe telleth vs: &amp; for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other end doubtlesse must this accompt be made, but onely because <note place="margin">Mat. 12. v. 36. This reason convinceth doubtles.</note> everie idle word is against the law of God.</p>
                  <p>This the papistes can never denie, and yet must they likewise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that idle wordes bee those sinnes, which they tearme ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nialles: and consequently that veniall sinnes be against the lawe of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that no mortall sinne can be forgiven in purgatorie, is confessed of all papistes without contradiction.</p>
                  <p>Thus writeth Bellarminus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Manet vltima sententia vera &amp; catholica, purgatorium pro ijs tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum esse, qui cum venialib. culpis moriuntur. &amp; rur sum pro illis qui</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Bellar. lib. 2. de purgat. c. 1. in fine.</note> 
                     <hi>decedunt cum reatupaenae, culpis iam remissis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:1677:59"/>
The true and catholike opinion remaineth, that purgatorie is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for those, that die with veniall sinnes: and againe, for those that die with the guilt of sinne, after their sinnes bee forgiven.</p>
                  <p>And with Bellarminus doe all other papistes agree, that such as die in mortall sinne, goe incontinently to hel.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that sundrie having venial sinnes abide the paines of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie, appeareth by Bellarminus his wordes before alleaged, and by Dominicus So to in these wordes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qui dixerit verbum contra spiritum sanctum, no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> remittetur ei in hoc seculo, neque in futuro. Vbi Gregorius lib.</hi> 4. <hi>di alogorum, adnotavit ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua</hi>

                     <hi>leuia peccata remitti in futuro seculo, per ignem purgationis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that shall blaspheme the holie Ghost, shall neither be forgiven in this vvorld, neither in the vvosld to come.</p>
                  <p>In vvhich place, Gregorius pope of Rome, noted certaine light sinnes to be forgiven in the world to come, by the fire of purgation. <note place="margin">Ide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> habeturd. 25. can. qualis.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And their Aquinas saith thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secundum enim quod peccata venialia sunt maioris vel minoris adhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentiae vel gravitatis, citius vel tardius per ignem purgantur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For veniall sinnes are purged by fire sooner or latter, according to <note place="margin">A quini 12. q. 89, ar, 2. ad. 4.</note> their greater or lesser adherence or gravitie.</p>
                  <p>And for a full accomplishment of this conclusion, Iosephus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles vttereth the great perplexitie of papistes, concerning this their purgative imagination.</p>
                  <p>These are his vvords:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quo igitur modo remittuntur (venialia) in purgatorio? varij sunt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di dicendi. Scotus dicit in instanti mortis, idest, in primo non esse ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ioseph. Ang. in 4. senten. de sacr. poenit. pag. 219.</note>

Soto asserit remitti quoad culpa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in purgatorio, propter actum chariiatis &amp; continuam patientiam, quam dum cruciantur, habent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hovv then are veniall sinnes forgiven in purgatorie? diverse hold diversly. Scotus saith, they are forgiven in the instant of death: that is, vvhen man first beginneth not to be, by reason of his merits in his life time.</p>

                  <head>The sixt Conclusion.</head>
                  <p>THe booke of Machabees, (which is the sole and onely founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of popish purgatorie,) is of no force at all to establish the same. This conclusion shalbe evidently prooved, when I shall effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually disproove the authoritie of the said booke of Machabees, wherewith many have a long time beene most miserably seduced. Marke therefore my discourse herein.</p>
                  <p>To prove that the 2. book of Machabees, (out of which, prayer and sacrifice for the dead, and consequently purgatory is gathered,) is not Canonicall, that is, not penned by the assistance of the holy ghost, I say first, that it is not in the canon of the Hebrewes, neither <note place="margin">1</note> did the Iewes or Hebrewes at any time repute it, as a part of holy &amp; divine scripture. This S. Hierome witnesseth in these wordes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sicut ergo Iudith, &amp; Tobiae, &amp; Machabaeorum libros legit quidem Ecclesia, sedinter Canonicas scripturas non recipit, sic &amp; haec duo volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina legit ad aedificationem plebis, non ad authoritatem Ecclesiastico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Hier. in epist, ad Chromati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um &amp; Helio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorum, de lib. Solomonis.</note> 
                     <hi>dogmatum confirmandam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As therefore the Church readeth the bookes of Iudith, &amp; of Toby, and of the Machabees, but receiveth them not amongst the Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call scriptures, so doth it read also these 2. volumes for edification of the people, but not to confirme any Ecclesiasticall doctrine. S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian hath the very same wordes in effect, in Symb. expositione.</p>
                  <p>S. Augustine doth testifie the same, when he thus writeth: <note place="margin">Cyprian. in expos. Symb. Aug. contra 2. Gaudentii epist. lib. 2. cap. 23. tom. 7.</note>

                     <hi>Hanc scripturam quae appellatur Machabaeorum, non habent Iudaei sicut legem, &amp; prophetas, &amp; Psalmos, quibus dominus testimonium per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibet tanquam testibus suis: dicens: oportebat impleri omnia, quae scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta sunt in lege, &amp; Prophetis, &amp; in Psalmis de me.

                  </p>
                  <p>This scripture which is of the Machabees, the Iewes repute not as they do the law, the Prophets, &amp; Psalmes, to which the Lord gave te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie as to his witnesses, saying: It behoved all things to be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, which are written in the law, in the Prophets, and Psalmes of me: but it is received of the Church not without profite, if it bee read or heard soberly: especially, for those Machabees, who for the lawe of God as true martyrs, suffred of their persecutors so unworthy &amp; hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible torments. And their owne deare fryer Bryton telleth vs, that neither is it knowne who was the author of these bookes, neither did <note place="margin">Bryto in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log. Mach.</note> the east Church ever receive them. <hi>I</hi> say secondly, that this second booke (out of which purgatorie is collected,) was never in Hebrew: and consequently, never authenticall among the Iewes. I say thirdly, <note place="margin">2</note> that many things found &amp; affirmed in the bookes of Machabees, <note place="margin">3</note>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:1677:60"/>
proove the same to be of no credit at all. For first, those for whome Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das offred sacrifice &amp; prayer, could not be holpen therwith: because as <note place="margin">1</note> the text recordeth, they perished for their secretidolatry: &amp; so saith the Glosse also. and consequently, Iudas erred grosly in praying and sacrificing for them, and the author of the booke likewise in comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Iudas his fact. wherupon it followeth necessarily, that the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was not directed by the holy ghost: because he concluded prayer for the dead, upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a notorious known fact conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned by the scriptures. Secondly, this booke saith, that the Iewes were led captives into Persia: but they were translated indeed, not into Persia but into Babylon, as their <note place="margin">2</note> owne Lyranus doth testifie. Thirdly, the second book saith, that Iudas with <note place="margin">2. Mac. 1. 19.</note> others wrote their epistle to Aristobolus in the 188 yere, but the first book <note place="margin">3</note> affirmeth Iudas to be dead in the yere 152, so that he must perforce write <note place="margin">2. Mach. 1.</note> his epistle 36 yeres after his death. Fourthly, the first book saith, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ochus <note place="margin">1. Mach. 9.</note> died in Babylon in his bed for sorow: but the second book avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <note place="margin">4</note> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Mach. 6.</note> that he was slaine in the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of Nannea. Fiftly, because the author of <note place="margin">2. Mach. 1.</note> the books of Machabes desireth pardo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if any thing be done amisse. These <note place="margin">5</note> be his words. <hi>Si bene &amp; ut historiae competit, hoc et ipse velim: si autem minus</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Mach. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>dignè, concedendumest mihi.</hi> If I haue done well and as is decent for the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie, that is my desire: but if not worthily, I must craue pardon. And <note place="margin">2. Mach. 14. 37.</note> doubtlesse, he that writeth by the direction of the holy ghost, needeth no pardon at all. Sixtly, the wilfull murder of Razias is there commended, which commendation can not proceed from the holy ghost. Seventhly, <note place="margin">6</note> the authour of the Macchabees doeth onely conclude praying <note place="margin">7</note> for the dead, because Iudas offered sacrifice for the dead. VVhich general illation vpon a particuler fact, is not good in popish maner of proceeding. For as their Maxime saith, which is true indeede:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Privilegium paucorum, non facit legem communem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The privilege of a fewe, can not establish a generall law: neither will it helpe the papistes to say, that saint Augustine and others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged this booke. For so saint Paul alleaged the testimonies of <note place="margin">Tit. cap. 1. 12. 1. Cor. 15. 33. Acts 17. 28.</note> Ethnickes, Epimenides, Menander, and Aratus: and popish divines alleage now and then Esops Fables.</p>
                  <p>But in what maner &amp; to what end S. Augustine alleaged this book, I have shewed out of Augustine alreadie. Neither yet will it helpe to say, (which some repute for a great argument) that this booke is in the corps of the Bible. For so is the fourth booke of Esdras with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the corps of the bible: &amp; yet doe the papistes themselves repute it, no better then a fable. yea, which is more to be noted: they will not haue the last end of the Lords praier, to be canonicall: albeit it be found in the greeke originall, and placed in the corpse of the bible.</p>
                  <p>For the great popish linguist Benedictus Arias Montanus, telleth <note place="margin">Arias Mont. in cap. 6. Mat. vers. 13.</note> the reader in his observation vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that place, that it is not of the text though he can not denie it, to be in the greeke &amp; first originall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:1677:61"/>
To conclude, neither did Iudas pray himselfe, neither did he will others to pray for remission of sinnes unto the dead: neither is it flatly so said in the Greeke copie, neither did hee offer sacrifice for the sinnes of the dead, but for the resurrection of the body, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing by sinne the death and corruption of the bodie, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth of sinne and followeth the same. VVhich my interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be gathered out of these wordes of the text it selfe:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bene &amp; religiose de resurrectione cogitans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thinking well and religiously of tbe dead. <note place="margin">2. Mach. 12. 43.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therefore is the illation of the popish latine translation, so highly commended and strictly commanded by the synod of Trent, vaine, frivolous, and foolish. He that penned the storie, hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all rime and reason infarced the same: because no such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion can be truly gathered, of Iudas his oblation and fact.</p>

               <p>FIrst therefore, since there is no purgatorie but Christs blood.</p>
               <p>Secondly, since after this life there is no place for merite or sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, since the booke of Machabees is not Canonicall: I conclude, that it is a sufficient motive for me to renounce the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish religion, as false, erroneous, and pernicious doctrine.</p>

               <head>The VIII. CHAP. Of dissention amongest the Papistes.</head>
               <p>ALthough nothing is more common with the Papistes, then to charge protestants with dissention: yet is it their owne pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar badge, as will appeare by due examination thereof.</p>
               <div n="1" type="article">
                  <head>The first article of dissention.</head>
                  <p>THe first erection of the English seminarie at Rome, began with dissention, betweene the students on the one part, and Master Morice the VVelsh-man on the other part. This Morice
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1677:61"/>
was appointed the rectour of the seminarie, with whome tooke part doctor Lewes an other VVelsh-man, (who was Arch-deacon to the Arch-bishop of Cambrey, and referendarie to the Pope at that time,) and also Cardinall Morone then the protectour of the English nation.</p>
                  <p>With the scholers tooke part, the close and politike Iesuites, who would seeme to doe nothing in the matter openly, but in deede did all in all secretly. For the space of some daies, (in which time the matter was hotely handled on both sides, daily sutes being made, and supplications exhibited unto his holinesse,) the Cardinall prevailed, and the pope discharged the schollers. But the Iesuites laboured so forcibly (&amp; yet covertly:) that within three daies, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding all the means that the Cardinall did and could make,) the schollers were againe restored to their places. For Toledo the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite was commaunded by the generall of their societie, to fall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate <note place="margin">This Toledo was pope Gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gories prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, &amp; advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser in al im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Eccle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>siasticall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note> on his knees before the popes holinesse, and there to make a pitifull lamentation for the overthrowe of England. that is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth, that now were reiected the finest wittes, the most towarde youthes, the seed of poperie, and the onely hope of the English nation: who now exiled for zeale in religion, and come to be his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish vassals: must either be trained up in papistrie after the Iesuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call maner, or els should England never be reclaimed world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out end.</p>
                  <p>VVhich sweete narration, no sooner sounded in the popes eares: but he commanded the schollers, to be received into the Colledge againe. And shortly after by Iesuiticall pollicie, Master Morice was <hi>officiperda,</hi> and a Iesuite made rectour in his place.</p>
                  <p>This dissention still continueth in that seminarie, as in which have bene foure or five (to speake of the least,) notorious combattes or endeavours betweene the rectour and the students: who should expulse ech other. And sometime the rectour hath so prevailed by pollicie, that some fewe haue bene dismissed: and other-somtime the generall of the Iesuites hath bin glad to change the rector, so to appease the dissention.</p>
                  <p>The like agreement is, amongst the papistes at home here in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland: for I pray you, did not their holy confessor M. Sherewood, even in the time of his bondes for poperie, murder his brother pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist in the towre of London? I wote he did. Did not olde Sir Iohn in the kidcote at Yorke so agree with Comberforth the priest, that they would never keepe companie the one with the other: though living both in one little prison, and imprisoned for the selfe same cause? it was so, my selfe was <hi>testis oculatus.</hi> Did not VVright, Fletcher, and Comberforth, imprisoned all together in the blocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houses at Hull upon Kingstone, agree in deviding their contributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1677:62"/>
which were right large ones, euen as theeves agree in devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their spoyles and robberies? Their mutuall contumelies fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the eares of countrey-papistes, their writings were lamented of the readers.</p>
                  <p>Let Padley, Norlees, and Haversiege say, if it be not so.</p>
                  <p>VVhat holy amitie is betweene the Iesuite Mushe, and other se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minarie-priestes, Brodell, Dakins, Butler, and others his brother priestes will witnesse with me.</p>
                  <p>And that ye may knowe in one worde the perfection of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Romish seminarie, you must vnderstand, that by the Iesuites their advise, the students in their supplications to the pope in their great conflict with the Cardinall, promised that they woulde all be romish priests, for the conversion of England to his Romish reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
                  <p>VVhich offer and promise was verie plausible in the popes eares.</p>
                  <p>For the better confirmation of which promise, all the schollers were shortly after called to their corporall oathes.</p>
                  <p>All which was wrought and contrived, by the politikes the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suites: some fewe schollers onely acquainted with the promise and oath, vntill the verie instant in which they did sweare.</p>
                  <p>VVhich oth as it was ungodlily made, so is it and will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlily perfourmed, so long as that colledge can stand, by all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilitie.</p>
                  <p>I say by all probabilitie, because I haue great reason so to thinke: though I can not as a God, divine of future contingents.</p>
                  <p>That it is vngodlily perfourmed, too much experience shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by so many seminaries sent daily in multitudes, oddely and disloyally into this land.</p>
                  <p>The like experience we haue in Iohn Gower, who so long resisted the Iesuites in refusing to bee made priest, and at length was made against his will for feare: as also in Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey Maxfielde and Thomas Nevvell verie proper schollers for their time, who staying in the seminarie untill they were ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to be priestes, were at the last expulsed because they would not be priestes. But now to dissentions of more importance.</p>

                  <p>NAvarre telleth vs, that wee are onely bounde to confesse our mortall and great sinnes; and that a papist comming to their sacramentall confession, may confesse some, and conceale other <note place="margin">Navarr. ca. 21. n. 34. in ench.</note> some.</p>
                  <p>These are his wordes:</p>

                  <p>This precept doth not include veniall sinnes, albeit they be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with mortals. whereupon it followeth, that the penitent may if he list, confesse one veniall and conceale another.

                  <p>Every sinne in that it is an offense against God and his eternall lawe, is mortall of it owne condition and indignitie according to the rigour of ivstice, and devideth us from the life of glorie. The reason is, because God may iustly punish every offense done against him, as well with eternall as temporall death, and with the mult of anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation. It is therefore mortall of it owne nature.</p>
                  <p>The assumption is gathered of this, for that no such punishment is so evill as the offense. as also because every penall death, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation both: ought rather to be tolerated, then the least sinne

                  <p>The Emperour Constantine gave the pope temporall administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Empire, in token of his reverence and homage: and the pope gaue the Emperour the same againe, as the stipend of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, for his peaceable protection of the church.</p>

                  <p>VVhere vpon I saie, that of the fulnes of power vpon reasonable cause, the pope may dissolve all the ciuill lawes, and make others: neither can the emperor with all lawes and consent of Christendom determine anie one iote against his mind.</p>
                  <p>Archidiaconus and Augustinus de Ancona, are of the selfe same o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion with Sylvester. But other papists are ashamed now thus to hold: and therfore write sharply against this opinion.</p>
                  <p>Bellarminus saith thus:</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>A venial sin is termed sin, after an vnperfect maner, &amp; way to a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal sin, euen as accidens is called ens in order to substantia, after an vnperfect reason of ens. For it is not against the law: because hee that sinneth venially, doth not that which the lawe forbiddeth, neither doth omit that to which the law by precept doth oblige, but doth besides the law, because it doth not observe the maner of reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which the law intendeth. But this opinion is sharply reproved, and flatly confuted, by many learned papistes. For Michael Baius apud Bellar. <note place="margin">Mich.

                  </p>
                  <p>The third opinion is Gersons and Almains, affirming that veni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and mortall sinnes do not differ in the nature of the thing, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Gerson. part. 3. de vita spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualilect. 1.</note> by the mercie of God: in that it pleased the maiestie of God, to assigne eternall paine for the one, and temporall for the other.

                  <p>VVhich opinion Covarruvias recordeth and iustifieth in these wordes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tertio probatur simplicem sacer dotem posse ex Rom. pontificis dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satione, sacramentum hoc confirmationis ministrare, auctoritate D. Gregorij</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is prooved thirdly, that a simple priest may vpon the popes grant, administer this sacrament of confirmation by S. Gregories autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, who permitteth and indeed giveth license unto priestes where bishops want, to doe the same.</p>
                  <p>But his opinion and practise is stoutly impugned by other great <note place="margin">vide Covarr. Ios. &amp; Bellar. de sacr. confir.</note> papistes, to wit, Bonaventura, Alphonsus, Durandus, Scotus, Maior, and pope Hadrian, who all avouch that pope Gregorie was a man and therefore might erre, and erred indeed egregiously, what grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more important dissention can be then this? for confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a sacrament with the papistes.</p>

                  <p>ALbertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, Ioannes Maior, Bonaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura, Almain, Richardus, and other papistes affirme, that every <note place="margin">vide Bellarm. &amp; Ios. Ang.</note> of their 7. orders is a sacrament. VVhereupon I might inferre right consequently, that the papistes have by iustnumber, 13. sacraments in all.</p>
                  <p>But their Durand doeth reiect this common opinion, as foolish and improbable. Yea, Victoria, Iosephus Angles, Caietanus, and Petrus Lombardus their master of sentences, are no small patrones of Durandus his opinion.</p>
                  <p>Iosephus Anglus writeth thus:</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is not erroneous to affirme with Durande that onely priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is a sacrament, and that the sixe other are meere sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, because the Church hitherto hath not declared the contrarie, neither is this opinion contrary to holy scripture, or to the doctrine of the fathers. Victoria hath these wordes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:1677:66"/>
                     <hi>Sienim aliqui ordines non sunt iuris divini ut certo constat demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noribus: non est dubitandum, quin collatio illorum committi possit non E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopo.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>For if some orders be not <hi>de iure divino,</hi> as it is certen of the lesser orders: there is no doubt but the collation thereof may be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him that is no bishop.</p>
                  <p>And in another place the said Victoria saith thus:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Opinio Durandi &amp; Caietani est probabilissima, scilicet quod solum sacerdotium est sacramentum, vel saltem quod quatuor minores non</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The opinion of Durand and Caietane is most probable, to witte, that onely priesthood is a sacrament, or at the least, that the foure lesser orders are not a sacrament. And a little after he telleth us, that pope Vrbanus and Innocentius are of the same opinion.</p>
                  <p>These be his wordes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Innocentius vir doctissimus, allegans Vrbanum papam dicit: Vrba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ait quod solum presbyteratus &amp; diaconatus sunt sacri ordines, &amp;</hi>

                  <p>Innocentius a very learned pope affirmeth with pope Vrbane, that onely priesthood and deaconship are holy orders, and that they only were in the primitiue Church.</p>

                  <p>I neither can nor dare denie, but as in our auncestors, so in my workes also are manie thinges, which may iustly, and without all temeritie be reproved. yea the same saint Augustine opposeth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly saint Pauls testimonie against all the writers Saint Hierome could <note place="margin">Aug. epist. 19. ad Hier. tom. 2. pag. 50.</note> alledge, about the great controversie, where saint Peter was repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of saint Paul.

And because my L. of Roch. is so highly renowmed in the church of Rome, he shal make an end of this conclusion, where he writeth in this maner: <hi>Nec Augustini nec Hieronimi, nec alterius cuinslibet auctoris doctrinae sic ecclesia subscripsit, quin ipsi locis aliquot ab ijs li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce</hi>

                  <p>For the proofe hereof, Melchior Canus writeth thus:</p>

                  <p>VVee know it often chaunceth so, that the greater part prevaileth against the better. vve know that those thinges are not ever the best, which please the most. we know that in matters of doctrine, the iudge ment of the wise ought to be followed: for wise men bee few, and fooles infinite. Iosephus Angles, Thomas Aquinas, and Petrus Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardus affirme it to be the opinion of the old fathers, of Basilius, of <note place="margin">Ioseph.

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1677:70"/>
for the better capacitie of the rude and ignorant people to whom he spake. which opinion of one onelie Augustine, was ever preferred in the church, as testifyeth Melchior Canus in these wordes:</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>But this common consent of the holie fathers doth not yeeld any found argument to devines, for the opinion of one onelie Augustine repugnant to the rest was ever thought probable in the church.</p>

                  <p>Being now readie to write vpon the pentateuch of Moses accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the literall sense, and purposing to bring now and then a new sense of the scripture, vnder the censure of our holy mother the church and apostolike seate: I desire all that shal read my commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, to contemne nothing rashly, but to ponder every thing with the scripture and the veritie of the christian faith, and the doctrine of the catholike church. And if at any time a new sense occurre, which is consonant to the text, and not dissonant from holy writ or doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the church, although it swarve from the opinion of never so manie fathers: yet let the readers iudge thereof indifferently, and according to equitie: Let them remember to give everie one his right: for this priviledge is onely graunted to the writers of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie scriptures: that wee must therefore beleeve it to be so, because they haue written so. Let none therefore loath a newe sense of holie scripture, because it dissenteth from the old doctors: but let him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actlie consider the text and context of the scripture: and if he find it to agree, let him praise God, who hath not tied the exposition of the holy scriptures, to the opinions of the old doctors, but to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie of the scripture it selfe, vnder the censure of the catholike church. For otherwise neither wee nor our posteritie should have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie hope to expound the scripture, but onelie to translate out of one booke into another.</p>
                  <p>Thus we heare the verdict of our Caietaine, our Thomist, our frier, our Cardinall of Rome: by whose resolution it is evident, that no sense, though never so new, no exposition though never so strange, no opinion though different from never so many fathers, ought to bee reiected if it be agreeable to the scriptures. and consequently, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth by the said resolution, that everie truth is to be tried by the scriptures and none by the fathers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:1677:71"/>
For first, our Cardinall telleth us, that he purposeth now &amp; then, to bring newe senses, new Glosses, nevv expositions of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <note place="margin">1</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, he saith, that such new senses must not rashly bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, but duely examined by the scriptures: and then admitted, if <note place="margin">5</note> they be found consonant to the same.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, he teacheth us this golden lesson, that God hath not ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the exposition of the scripture, to the iudgement of any auncient <note place="margin">3</note> father or fathers whosoever.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he telleth us, that the Apostles and such as only penned the holy scriptures, had this speciall prerogative, that they coulde <note place="margin">4</note> not erre. All which important pointes, are so learnedly, so gravely, &amp; so christianly observed by this Cardinall, as more cannot be wished: yea, in the selfe same preface hee professeth constantly, that hee will neither expound the Greeke nor the Latine text: but the fountaine <note place="margin">Caiet. vbi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra.</note> and the originall, to wit, the Hebrew. And his reason is, because the Hebrew onely is authenticall.</p>
                  <p>Where note by the way, that the Latine edition which the papists tearme <hi>vulgata,</hi> and which is so magnified by the late councell of <note place="margin">1</note> Trent, as both the Greeke and the Hebrew must give place unto the same: is of small or no authoritie in respect of the Hebrew, by Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall Caietanus his resolution.</p>
                  <p>Note secondly, that this Cardinal did dedicate these his commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, <note place="margin">2</note> (in which all these memorable observations are conteined,) to our holy father Pope Clement him selfe, who perused them and difallowed no part thereof: and consequently, that this doctrine of Caietane is confirmed by the pope. For so mightily hath God alwayes wrought for the truth of his Gospell, as evident testimonies are set downe euen by the adversaries, and remaine this day with them vncancelled, for confirmation of the same. Neither is this the opinion of the popes Cardinall onely, but of Aquinas also his ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall and best approoved doctour.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Although the place of authoritie, which is grounded vpon mans reason, be most weake and infirme: yet the place which is grounded vpon divine authoritie, is most sure and effectuall. neverthelesse, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred doctrine vseth also mans reason, not indeede to establish faith, (for so faith should lose it merite,) but for the manifestation of some other thinges which are deliuered in this doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Since therefore grace doth not destroy nature, but doth pervert the same, it is expedient that naturall reason be servant vnto faith, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as naturall inclination of the will is servant vnto charitie. wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon the apostle willeth vs, to bring our vnderstanding captive to the obedience of Christ. And from hence commeth it, that sacred doctrine vseth also the authorities of philosophers, when they could by naturall reason haue knowledge of the truth, as Saint Paul al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the saying of Aratus. yet sacred doctrine vseth such authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as arguments which are externall, and onely probable. But v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the authorities of canonicall scripture, as argumentes that are proper, and which conclude of necessitie. as for authorities of the doctors of the church, it vseth them as proper arguments: but which are onely probable, and do not conclude necessarilie. For our faith is grounded vpon revelation made to the apostles and prophets, who wrote the canonical scripture: but not vpon revelation of anie other writers, if anie were made vnto them. Thus saith Aquinas. Out of whose words I gather First, that the authoritie brought from man, is ever insufficient.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>I</hi> gather secondly, that that ground whereupon we must build, as vpon an vndoubted truth, is onelie and solelie the authoritie of the scriptures.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 I gather thirdlie, that mans reason may never be vsed, to establish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny point of doctrine.</p>

4 I gather fourthlie, that the fathers are to be read reverentlie, and their authorities to be vsed as probable reasons, but not as necessarie demonstrations.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 I gather fiftlie, that feined romish revelations are not authentical.

                  <p>For proofe of this conclusion, S. Paul writeth unto Timothie in this manner:</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>For which cause the Apostle addeth these wordes:</p>

                  <p>In which wordes the holie vessell of God Saint Paul, confirmeth that which he said before, to wit: that the holie scripture is able of it selfe, to instruct vs fullie vnto salvation.</p>
                  <p>And the Apostle declareth this by an argument drawen from the sufficient enumeration of those partes, which are required vnto our salvation: and withall he commendeth the scripture, of the sufficient cause, end and vse thereof.</p>

                  <p>For in those things which are plainely set downe in the scripture, are found all those thinges, which conteine our faith and maners, that is, hope, and charitie.</p>
                  <p>Loe, all things that concerne faith, hope, and charitie, are plainly found in holie scripture. where it is diligently to be observed, that Saint Augustine doth not onelie say, that all thinges conteining faith, hope, and charitie, are to bee found in the scripture: but hee doth further say, that all such thinges are plainlie set downe in the scriptures.</p>
                  <p>VVherevpon I inferre this notable document against popish doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that albeit manie thinges in manie places of the scripture bee obscure and intricate, (which I willinglie graunt vnto the papistes,) &amp; consequentlie, that the same surpasse the capacity and iudgement of the vulgar sort: yet are all thinges concerning our beleefe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our maners, concerning our hope, concerning our charity, concerning our salvation so plaine and so manifest, as everie one even of the meanest iudgement, may easilie perceive, and vnderstande the same: and this the papistes must perforce graunt vnto mee, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will I require more at their handes.</p>

Dionysius Areopagita, who lived in the Apostles time, is of the same mind:</p>
                  <p>These are his wordes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Omnino igitur non audendum est, quicquam de summa abstrusaque divinitate aut dicere, aut cogitare, praeter eaquae nobis divinitus scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae</hi>

                  <p>In no wise therefore may wee make bold to speake, or thinke anie thing of the most high and ineffable divinitie: but that onelie, which holie writ hath revealed vnto vs from heaven.</p>
                  <p>Melchior Canus, albeit he labour with tooth and naile to prove the consent of the fathers, to yeelde vs an vndoubted argument of <note place="margin">Canus de lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis l. 7. c. 3. pag. 228.</note> the truth: yet can hee not denie that the scripture is perfect and most sufficient in everierespect:</p>
                  <p>These are his wordes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sedquaer at hic for sit an aliquis: cumsit perfectus scriptur arum canon, sibique adomnia satis superque sufficiat: quid opus est, vt ei sanctorum &amp; intelligentia iung atur &amp; auctoritas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But some man happily here will demaund: that since the canon of the scripture is perfect, and most sufficient of it selfe to everie end, and in everie respect: what neede have wee to ioine with the same, either the exposition or the authoritie of the fathers.</p>
                  <p>Thus saith Canus, not denying the sufficiencie of the holie scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but requiring the commentaries of the fathers, for the better vnderstanding of the same. whose opinion in that respect I doe not whollie dislike, as is alreadie declared in the ninth chapter.</p>
                  <p>This being so, it followeth by a necessarie consequent: that neither yong nor old, rich nor pore men nor women, learned nor vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, ought to be debarred from reading of the scriptures. which my doctrine was altogether practicall, in the auncient and primitive church.</p>
                  <p>For confirmation whereof, no greater testimonie can be had, then the old vulgar translations of the bibles.</p>
                  <p>In which behalfe, I savv verie latelie to my great comfort in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarie of Emmanuell colledge in Cambridge, an English Bible of such antiquitie, as I could not vnderstand perfectlie the greater part of the wordes. vvhich is an evident demonstration, that bibles were in old time translated into the vulgar tongue, so as the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might reade them.</p>
                  <p>Thomas Aquinas, (whose person the church of Rome hath canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed for a saint, and his doctrine for authenticall,) teacheth vs not to beleeue anie thing concerning God, save that onelie vvhich is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in the scripture expresselie, or at least significantlie.</p>

                  <p>And in another place, the same Aquinas saith thus.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>In vvhich vvords Aquinas avoucheth most plainlie, that al things necessarie for our salvation, are conteined in the scriptures.

                  <p>If then this be true as it is most true, (for the papistes neither can nor will denie Aquinas,) that whatsoever Christ vvould haue vs to knovv, of his miracles, of his life, of his conversation, of his preaching, of his teaching, of his doctrine, the same is novv vvritten in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: no man doubtlesse, but he that vvill <hi>cum ratione insanire,</hi> can denie all thinges necessarie for our salvation, to be conteined in the holie scriptures.</p>

                  <p>I doe not thinke it certaine, albeit all vvriters say so, because I can not find it in the scripture.</p>
                  <p>Againe in an other place, he vvriteth in this maner.</p>

                  <p>ALL persons ought to read the scriptures diligentlie, because out of them even the simplest of all may gather so much, as shall bee necessarie for their salvation.</p>
                  <p>This I say, against that popish ridiculous, vnchristian, and pestilent abuse, in vvhich they deliver by vvay of tradition to the people, the scriptures, sacramentes, and church service, in a strange tongue to them vnknowen. vvhich their vngodlie and intollerable dealing.

For this is the cause of infinite evils, that you are ignorant in the scriptures. From hence springeth the manifold mischiefe of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, from hence dissolute life, from hence vaine, and vnprofitable labours.</p>
                  <p>For euen as they that are deprived of this light, can not goe on the right way: so they that doe not behold the beames of holie scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are enforced incontinentlie to offend in many things, as wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in farre greater darkenesse.</p>
                  <p>This is the censure of saint Chrysostome: out of which I note,</p>

                  <p n="3">3 <hi>I</hi> note secondly, that if it be a shame for such as are charged with wives, children, and families, only to heare sermons, &amp; not to studye the scriptures vvithall: much more is it a shame for others that bee more free, not to read them diligently: and greatest shame of al for a bishop to approve them that wil not so doe.</p>
                  <p>I note thirdlie, that heresies, dissolute life, and all other evils, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede of ignorance, and not reading the scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the said Chrysostome in another place hath these vvordes.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>By this maner then if we will search the scriptures diligentlie, we shall attaine salvation: if we shall be wholie conversant in them, we shall be taught both right doctrine and good life. For it can not bee but he shall get profite, that both heareth and talketh with God.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Doubtlesse, if we can not beare away all thinges conteined in the scriptures, at the least let vs reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber those things, which are taught, &amp;

read in the Church.</p>
                  <p>In which words he speaketh not onely of sermons, but also of the gospels, epistles, praiers, lessons, and histories of the bible. For ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons are conteined in the worde <hi>(decentur)</hi> which are preached, and the rest in the word <hi>(recitantur)</hi> which are read or rehearsed.</p>
                  <p>And if such thinges had beene read in a strange tongue, the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar sort could not haue committed them to memorie.</p>
                  <p>Saint Augustine doth not onely exhort to reade the scriptures, but also giveth great encouragement thereto, avouching that the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures may be vnderstood with all facilitie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Magnifice igitur &amp; salubriter spiritus sanctus ita, scriptur as sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas modificavit, vt locis apertioribus fami occurreret, obscurioribus</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The holie ghost hath so magnificallie and healthfullie measured the holie scriptures, that in the obscure places lothsomnes is taken away: and with the places that be plaine and easie, our hunger is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed. And his reason hereof followeth in these next wordes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nihil enim fere de illis obscuritatibus eruitur, quod non plani ssime dictum alibi reperiatur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For almost nothing is conteined in obscure places, which is not most plainelie vttered in some other place. so then by the testimonie of this holie father, so auncient for antiquitie, so holie for vertue, so grave for auctoritie, so profound for his iudgement, so rare for his <note place="margin">Loe, the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are plaine &amp; ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</note> wit, so renowmed for his learning, that the papistes hitherto have admired his doctrine as an oracle from heaven: the holie scriptures are easie to be vnderstood: and whatsoever is obscurelie spoken in one place, the same is plainlie told in another.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, the practise of those godlie Christians, of whom we reade in the Actes of the Apostles, decideth this controversie suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entlie: as who beeing meere lay-men, did notwithstanding studie the <note place="margin">Act. 17. v. 11.</note> scriptures most seriouslie.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>TRaditions are to be examined by the holie scriptures the true touchstone of veritie: and to be admitted, when they are found consonant to the same.</p>
                  <p>This conclusion is evidentlie proved, by the iudgement practicall of saint Cyprian. For he being required by Stephanus then bishop of <note place="margin">Where was the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome then?</note> Rome to yeelde vnto traditions, did not terme the said Stephanus by the title of Pope, or holinesse, (as now the romish maner is,) but by the name of fellow or brother, and calling him blind byarde (not
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1677:78"/>
Saint Peters successour, who could not erre) did contemne &amp; vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie reiect that tradition, which the said Stephanus requested him to yeelde vnto.</p>
                  <p>His verie owne words are these:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nihil innovetur, inquit, nisiquod traditumest? vnde est istae traditio?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Cyprian ad Pompeium, pag. 228.</note> 
                     <hi>vtrumne de dominica &amp; evangelica auctoritate descendens, an de A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolorum mandat is atque epistolis veniens? ea enim facienda esse quae scriptae sunt, Deus testatur, &amp; proponit ad Iesum Nave. dicens: non recedet liber legis huius ex ore tuo, sed meditaberis in eo die ac nocte, vt observes facere omnia quae scripta sunt. item, Dominus apostolos su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os mittens, mandat baptizari gentes &amp; doceri, vt observent omnia quae cunque ille praecepit. Si ergo aut in evangelio praecipitur, aut Apostolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum epistolis, aut actibus continetur, vt a quacunque haeresi venientes non baptizentur, sedtantum manus illis imponantur in paenitentiam, observetur etiam &amp; haec sancta traditio.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let nothing be renewed, saith Pope Stephanus, but let that bee done which was received by tradition. from whence came this tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? whether doth it descend from the auctoritie of our Lord &amp; of his gospel, or commeth it from the epistles, or actes of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles? For God testifyeth that those thinges must be done which are written, and propoundeth them vnto Nave, saying: Let not the book of this law depart out of thy mouth, but meditate in it day &amp; night, that thou maiest observe to doe all thinges that are written. Our lord also sending forth his Apostles, chargeth them to baptize the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and to teach them to doe all thinges vvhich he commaunded them. If therfore it be commanded in the gospel, or in the epistles of the apostles, or actes, that such as came from anie herisie should not bee baptised, but onelie receive imposition of handes for penance, then let this holie tradition be observed.</p>
                  <p>Thus wee see, that this auncient father, canonized by the pope for an holie and blessed martir, will indeede admit traditions, (as the wiser sort of protestantes do admit with him,) but yet no other traditions, then are found constant to the scriptures:</p>
                  <p>By which scriptures saint Cyprian examineth the veritie of al tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, admitting those that be consonant, and reiecting such as be dissonant from the same. At vvhat time the Arrians vvould not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the vvord <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,) because it vvas not found in the scriptures, the fathers of the councel did not then alledge traditions for proofe thereof, neither did they say, that manie thinges must bee believed, which are not vvritten.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:1677:79"/>
But they answered simplie, that though that word were not exptes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie written: yet was it virtuallie, and effectuallie conteined in the scriptures. which thing is evident by the testimonie of Athanasius, who writeth in this manner.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sed tamen cogno scat qui squis est studiosior is animi, has voces tamet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si in</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Although the wordes bee not founde in the scripture, yet haue they that meaning and sense which the scripture approveth, and intendeth, as everie one that studieth the scripture seriouslie, may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily vnderstand.</p>
                  <p>Origen giveth counsel to trie all doctrines by the scriptures, even as pure gold is tried by the touchstone.</p>
                  <p>Thus doth hee write.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Debemus ergo ad testimonium omnium verborum quae proferimus in</hi>

                     <hi>doctrina, proferre sensum scripturae, quasi confirmantem quem exponi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus sensum. sicut enim omne aurum quodquod fuerit extra templum, non est sanctificatum, sicomnis sensus qui fuerit extra divinam scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram (quamvis admirabilis videatur quibusdam:) non est sanctus, qui non continetur a sensu scripturae, quae solu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>et e sensum solu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sanctificare quem habet in se, sicut templum proprium aurum, Non ergo debemus ad confirmandam doctrinam nostram nostram nostras proprios intellectus iur a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, &amp; quasi testimonia assumere, quae vnusqui sque nostrum intelligit, &amp; secundum veritatem aestimat esse: ni ostenderit eos sanctos esse ex eo, qui in scripturis continetur divinis quasi in templis quibusdam Dei.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Stulti ergo &amp; caeci omnes qui non cognoscunt, quin templum, idest, lectio scripturarum, magnum &amp; venerabilem facit sensum, sicut au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum sacratum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>VVee must therefore alledge the sense of scripture, for the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of everie word vvee vtter in doctrine, as which confirmeth the sense of our exposition.</p>
                  <p>For as all gold which is without the temple is not sanctifyed: so eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie sense, which is vvithout the holie scripture (albeit it seeme to some wonderfull,) is vnholie, because it is not conteined in the sense of scripture: which onely sanctifyeth that sense which it hath in it selfe, as the temple sanctifyeth the gold. wee must not therefore for the confirmation of our doctrine, sweare to the sense, which everie one of vs vnderstandeth, and conceiveth to be true, vnlesse wee can shew it to be divine, because it is conteined in the divine scriptures: as in
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:1677:79"/>
the temple of God.</p>
                  <p>Foolish therefore and blind are all those, who know not that the temple, to wit, the reading of scriptures, maketh the sense great and venerable, as hallowed gold.</p>
                  <p>In another place, the said Origen hath these words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Querimus verba quae dicta sunt, iuxta personae dignitatem expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere:</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>VVee seeke to expound the wordes rehearsed, according to the dignitie of the person: wherefore wee must of necessitie, call the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie scriptures to witnes.</p>
                  <p>For our iudgements and expositions without those witnesses, are of no credite at all.</p>
                  <p>Thus wee see, Origen his iudgement, and that nothing can be of credite, which is not grounded vpon the scriptures.</p>
                  <p>But what? is Origen onelie of this opinion? no verilie, for all aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, grave, and learned fathers, are of the selfe same mind.</p>

                  <p>The same saint Augustine in another place hath these wordes:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nemo mihi dicat, O quid dixit Donatus, aut quid dixit Parmeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Let no man say to mee, Oh what said Donatus, or what said Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menianus, or Pontius, or anie of them: because we must not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to catholike bishops, if they chaunce to erre in anie thing, and speake against the canonicall scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Sainte Chrisostome agreeth vniformelie vnto the rest, writing in
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1677:80"/>
this maner:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cum videritis haeresim impiam quae est exercitus antichristi stantem</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>when you shall see wicked heresie, which is Antichristes armie, standing in the holie Church: at that time they that be in Iurie must flee to the mountaines, that is, they that are Christians must flee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the scriptures.</p>
                  <p>And why commaundeth he at this time all Christians to flee to the scriptures? because at that time, when heresie hath yeelded vp the churches, no proofe can be had of true christianitie, neither anie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refuge is left to christians desyrous to know the veritie of faith, but onlie the holie scriptures.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the said Crisostome saith in an other place after this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner:</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Neither must we say anie thing without witnesses, and vpon our own cogitation onelie. For if any thing be spoken without the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the cogitation of the auditors halteth, sometime graunting, sometime doubting, sometime reiecting that which is spoken as fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous, and sometime accepting it as probable. But when testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie is brought out of the scripture of Gods word, then it confirmeth both the wordes of the speaker, and the mind of the hearer.</p>
                  <p>And yet the said Chrysostome hath an other place, well worthie to be written in golden letters.</p>
                  <p>Thus he saith:</p>

                  <p>Behold here a most godlie exhortation, and grave advise, given vs by this holie father.

                  <p>Neither must we beleeve and doe what this or that man saith, but what wee find to be true, by painfull studie of the scriptures.</p>
                  <p>For which cause, vviselie and gravelie said Tertullian:</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>That is: that to be true, vvatsoever vvas first, and that to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfait vvhatsoever came after.</p>
                  <p>And for the same end said the holie Prophet:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lucerna pedibus meis verbum tuum, &amp; lumen semitis meis.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>As if he had said, of our selves vve are but darknes, and can not see, except vve be lightened with Gods vvord.

                  <head>The fourth Conclusion.</head>
                  <p>POpish traditions are so vncertaine and doubtfull, as the best lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned papistes are at great contention about them, and can not possiblie be accorded therin. For the exact proofe of this conclusion, that intollerable &amp; endlesse strife, which was a thousand and foure hundred yeares sithence betweene Victor then bishop of Rome, and other Bishops of Asia, may suffice if nothing els were said. For on both sides tradition apostolical was alledged and stoutlie avouched, for and concerning the celebration of Easter.</p>
                  <p>Of this matter, thus writeth Eusebius Caesariensis.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Episcopis autem in Asia coactis, qui morem iam olim ipsis a maioribus troditum sedulo observandum constanter asseverabant, praefuit Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The bishops of Asia assembled in councell, Polycrates beeing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident, affirmed constantlie, that that custome ought to be observed, which they of old time had received by tradition. which tradition to have beene continued vntill his daies, the said Polycrates in his epist. to Victor and the church of Rome, sheweth plainelie in these words: VVee keepe easter entirelie, and incorruptlie: neither doe we adde or detract anie thing</p>
                  <p>And in the same epistle hee telleth vs, that Philip one of the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven deacons, Saint Iohn the Evangelist, Saint Polycarpe, Saint Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirius, Saint Melito, and others, did all obserue the same tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>These bee his wordes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Isti omnes diem paschatis</hi> 14. <hi>die lunae ex evangelij prescripto obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varunt, nihil ab eo instituto ac more plane digressi: sed secundum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulam &amp; normam fidei eum assidue tenuerunt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All these have observed Easter the fourteenth day of the moone after the prescripr of the Gospell, declining nothing at all from that custome and ordinance, but dailie reteined it according to the rule and analogie of faith.</p>
                  <p>But Victor and other bishoppes with him, defended bitterlie
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:1677:81"/>
a contrarie tradition. For thus writeth the said Eusebius of him:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uictor qui tum Rom. ecclesiae praeerat, totius Asiae ecclesias cum alijs finiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis, tanquam alterius fidei &amp; opinionis, simul omnes (vt complectar brevi) à</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Victor then governing the Church of Rome, indeavoureth to cut off from the common vnitie of the Church, all the Churches of Asia together with others adioyning, and very bitterly inveigheth against them by his letters.</p>
                  <p>Which fact of Victor, Irenaeus and other Bishops sharpely reprooved in their letters to the said Victor. Which thing Ruffinus plainely testifieth, in these words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sed hoc non omnibus placebat Episcopis, quin potius &amp; è contrario scribentes</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ruffinus, in sua trans.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>Yet this his dealing pleased not all Bishops, but contrariwise they wrote vnto him, bidding him to practise rather that belonged to peace, and to studie for concord and vnitie. Finally, their letters are also extant, in the which they sharpely chide Victor, as one that respected vnprofitably the good of the Church.</p>
                  <p>Thus saith Ruffinus. In like manner, (though with more modestie,) dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented Anicetus an other bishop of Rome, from S. Polycarpe bishop of Smyrna. Of which variance, thus writeth Eusebius:</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Neither could Polycarpus perswade Anicetus, to keepe the custome and tradition of Asia.</p>
                  <p>Now, gentle Reader, what neede more to be said, for the vncertentie of traditions?</p>
                  <p n="1">1 For first, these Bishops that thought thus diversly of traditions, lived within one hundred yeeres of Christ: at what time the Church was in good estate, and stained with very few or no corruptions at all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Secondly, the one side doubtles, was seduced with false traditions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Thirdly, S. Polycarpe and other holy bishops of that age, made no more account of the bishop of Rome his opinion, or authoritie, then of an other mans.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Fourthly, they were so farre from acknowledging him to be the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame head of the Church, that they all reputed them selves his equals: and controlled him as sharply for his doctrine, as S. Paul reprooved S. Peter for his conversation.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Fiftly, if S. Polycarpe had cause in his time, beeing the flourishing age
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:1677:82"/>
of the Church, to doubt of Romish traditions; much more have we cause in these latter daies, to stand in doubt thereof. For now hath iniquitie the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hande, nowe are corruptions more frequent, no we doe errours in every place more abound. Let vs therefore follow S. Augustines advise, let vs ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit nothing rashly, let vs examine all doubtfull traditions and doctrines, by the touchstone of veritie, the holy Scriptures. And least any man thinke S. Augustine to be of another minde, these are his owne expresse wordes:</p>

                  <p>THere is yet a third kinde of confession commended in holy writ, which is a generall confession of our sinnes: not onely internally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, but also externally before the ministers of his worde and sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: but this kinde doth not include in it a total and specifical enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of our sinnes. This manner of confession made king David before the Prophet Nathan, when he reprooved him for his offences.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peccaui domino,</hi> I have sinned vnto the Lord, saith David. And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet answered: <hi>Dominus quo<expan>

In like manner the sinnefull woman, of whome S. Luke maketh mention, confessed her sinnes generally in teares, signes, <note place="margin">Luk. 7. 38, 48.</note> and gestures, and received incontinently absolution at Christs handes: for he said vnto her, <hi>Remittuntur tibi peccata,</hi> thy sinnes are forgiven thee. Which manner of confession is fitly described in the booke of Nehemias, <note place="margin">2. Esd. 8. &amp; 9.</note> in the 8. and 9. chapter. For when Esdras and the Levites did interpret the law vnto the people, then the people acknowledging their offences and the offences of their forefathers, did lament, weepe, &amp; confesse their sinnes before the Levites and the whole congregation: and that done, the Levits repeated their confession, and desired pardon of God for the same. So this <note place="margin">The true ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing our sinnes</note> day in the Church of England, the people confesse their sinnes generally before the minister, and in the face of the whole congregation. Yea, in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie they confesse such speciall sinnes, as grieve and clogge their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, &amp; for which they stand in most neede to have advise and counsell. Which libertie is graunted in England also: for such as list may confesse their sinnes to the minister privately, and have both his advise and absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if he finde them penitent. Which confession and absolution, would <note place="margin">It is to be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession were more vsed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is nowe a dayes.</note> God it were more in practise then it is: because instruction and consolation might redound vnto the penitent, by vertue of the same. This kinde of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession was much frequented in the primitive Church, at such time as the zeale of Gods people was great, and their devotion fervent: then did all confesse their sinnes generally: then were none commanded to confesse specifically: then did Christs ministers execute their functions duely: then did S. Iohn Baptist in zealous manner reproove vice, extoll vertue, thunder out Gods wrath and ire against wicked and impenitent sinners, &amp; with all promise free pardon and remission of sinnes, to all such as would lament their sinnes, amend their lives; reforme their manners, and beleeve in Christ Iesus the innocent lambe, that taketh away the sinnes of the world. Then the Scribes, Pharisies, and great multitudes of people were inflamed with compunction at S. Iohns preaching, bewayled their former lives, confessed <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 6, 7, 8.</note> generally their sinnes, and desired baptisme for the same. Then the holy vessel of God S. Paul, wrought great miracles by the power of God; in so <note place="margin">Act. 19. 18, 19.</note> much that many of the faithfull came vnto him confessing their sinnes, and such as had followed magicall arts brought their bookes together, and burnt them in the presence of the people.</p>

                  <head>The fourth Conclusion.</head>
                  <p>THE Popish specificall enumeration of all our sinnes, is both impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to man, and neither commanded by Christ, nor practised by his Apostles. That it is impossible to be performed by man, the Prophet
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:1677:84"/>
prooveth, when he saith:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Delicta quis intelligit? ab occultis me is munda me.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 18. 13, 14.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who doth vnderstand his offences? clense me from secret faults.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quis potest dicere, mundum est cormeum, purus sum à peccato?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 20. 9.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Who can say, my heart is cleane, I am free from my sinne?</p>
                  <p>Neither will it serve their turne, to say as Cardinall Caietan doth, that confession is taken two waies: to wit, absolutely; and as it is the act of man. <note place="margin">Caietanus in summ. in vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tima pagella.</note> To confesse all sinnes absolutely, is to leave no sinne vnconfessed: but to confesse all sinnes, as confession is the act of man, is to confesse all those sinnes which are in the power of man: that is, which man doth, or may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member after diligent examination of his conscience. And therefore saith Caietan, when the Gospell requireth the confession of all sinnes in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of penance: it is not meant of all sinnes absolutely, but of all sinnes which are in mans power to confesse. This distinction, I say, will not serve;</p>
                  <p n="1">1 First, because this distinction, is not mentioned in the Gospell.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Secondly, because there is no more reason for the confession of one, then for the confession of all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Thirdly, because this notwithstanding, a man shal alway remaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexe: as who can never tel, when he hath vsed sufficientinquisition in that behalfe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Fourthly, because one mortall sinne can not be remitted without ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as all papists confesse; and consequently, either the secret not confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed mortalls, are remitted with the confessed mortalls, or none at all be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the absolution: if they answer, that none are remitted, because some are not confessed: then shall the penitent never have absolution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he can never confesse al as is prooved: if they say, the secret not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed mortals, be remitted with the other: then is it not needefull to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse them after, when they come to remembrance: which yet al papists re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, as necessarie to salvation.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Fiftly, because it followeth herevpon, that penitents are bound to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse their sinnes very many times, which the Popes law requireth but once in the yeere: I proove it, because if they stay any time from confession, they may forget their sinnes through their owne default, and so make frustrate their absolution.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Sixtly, because the priests are often so ignorant, that they can not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish mortall and veniall sinnes: which yet is necessarie in absolution.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Seaventhly, because the priest standeth often excommunicate, and often dealeth with reserved cases, and a thousand such like things chance in absolution. Yea, the archpapists this day, perceiving this matter to be so intricate and dangerous: partly by reason of the cases so reserved, partly by reason of innumerable excommunications, and partly by reason of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in their priests: have invented this poore shift for an helpe, if it may be: to wit, that the Pope shall give to every seminarie priest, full authoritie to
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1677:84"/>
absolve from all excommunications and reserved cases what soever: so that now we have so many virtuall Popes in England, as seminarie priests. For every one of them, hath <hi>plenitudinem potestatis:</hi> and it is a world to consider, how this power is vsed. For because neither the penitent, nor the priest can tell, howe often the partie is excommunicate; the priest for securitie, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth every time over every person, these words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I absolve thee from every bond of excommunication, so farre foorth as I can, and thou standest neede.</hi> and this is done in latine.</p>
                  <p>All which frustrate the same, and open to the penitent the gate of des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration. That this manner of confession, is neither commanded by Christ, nor practised by his Apostles: may be evidently prooved by their owne ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-law, as their owne doctours testifie.</p>
                  <p>Thus writeth the great Thomist Sylvester Prieras:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quarto, vtrum ad confessionem teneamur divino iure vel humano? &amp; dico</hi>

                     <hi>quod canonistae videntur tenere, quod sit de iurepositivo. &amp; ad hoc est glossa de pen. dist. v. in summa, quae vult quod instituta sit à quadam vniversali tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione ecclesiae: ideo infert, quod confiterinon tenentur infideles, nec similiter grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci, ex quo non acceptaverunt huiusmodi constitutionem, sicut nec votu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> castitatis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is demanded fourthly (saith the great papist Sylvester,) whether we be bound to popish confession, by the law of God, or by the positive law of man? and I say, the canonists holde, that we are but bound by the lawe of man. And of this opinion is the glosse, which is of this minde, that confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was institute by a certaine vniversall tradition of the Church; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the said glosse inferreth, that infidels are not bound to confession, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Greekes in like manner: since they did never approove such consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, no more then the vow of chastitie.</p>

                  <p>This to be true, S. Christome confirmeth in these words:</p>

                  <p>I doe not bid thee come forth in publike, neither to accuse thy selfe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others: but I would have thee to obey the Prophet, when he saith, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale thy way to God.

                  <p>And in another place, the same S. Chrysostome hath these words:</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Confesse thy sinnes daily, that thou maist blot them out. But if thou be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to confesse them to an other, confesse them daily in thine heart. I doe not bid thee confesse them to thy fellow servant, that he may vpbraide thee. Confesse them to God, who can cure the same.</p>
                  <p>Saint Augustine is very plaine in this point, for these are his expresse words:</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>What have I therefore to doe with men, that they must heare my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s? as though they shold heale al my diseases? a curious kinde to know an others mans life, and sluggish to correct their owne.

                  <head>The fifth Conclusion.</head>
                  <p>ALbeit Popish auricular confession be so magnified with Papistes, that every one is commanded vnder paine of damnation to beleeve the same, as instituted by Christ himselfe: yet was it not an article of popish faith, for the space of one thousand and five hundred yeeres after Christ. This conclusion, because it is very important, I shal desire thee, gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to ponder deepely with me my discourse.</p>
                  <p>Iosephus Angles Valentinus a popish fryer, and bishop of Bosana, in the second tome of that worke which he dedicated to the Pope himselfe <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> hath these expresse words:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ante concilium Later. erat haereticum negare necessitatem confessionis, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantes tamen</hi>

                     <hi>non erant haeretici. ratio est, quia nondum erat ab ecclesia decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before the councell of Lateran it was hereticall to denie the necessitie of confession, but yet they were not heretikes that denied it. The reason is, because the Church of Rome had not yet declared it to be an article of faith.</p>
                  <p>Loe, these words conteine effectually, the exact proofe of this conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if they be well marked.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 We must therefore observe first, that who soever beleeveth not sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly every decree of the Church of Rome in matters of faith, is holden of that Church for an heretike.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 We must observe secondly, that the councell of Lateran, (whereof this fryer speaketh) was holden in time of Pope Iulius the second, and Pope Leo the tenth, that is 1500. yeeres after Christ.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 VVe must observe thirdly, that vntill fifteene hundred yeeres after Christ were expyred, they that beleeved not popish auricular confession to be ordeined by Christ, were no heretikes. For so, as you see, this fryer tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, and the Pope him selfe graunteth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 VVe must observe fourthly, that the Church of Rome hath no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, to coyne any new article of faith.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 VVe must observe fiftly, that the Church of Rome hath no new reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in matters of faith, but the very same which it had in the Apostles time: both which latter observations, their owne deare <hi>Canus</hi> telleth vs, in these words:</p>

                  <p>For the Church received all doctrines of faith from the Apostles, eyther by word or writing. Because the Apostles were the ministers of the word, neither hath the Church any new revelations in faith.</p>
                  <p>Now out of these observations which are evident, it followeth neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily, that confession this day ought not to be an article of faith, no not in the Church of Rome.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 For first, during the time of fifteene hundred yeeres after Christ, it was no article of faith in the Church of Rome.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Secondly, the Church of Rome can not make that an article of faith now, which was no article of faith in the Apostles time.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Thirdly, the Church of Rome hath no new revelations, in matters of Christian faith. For so as you have heard, hath their owne <hi>Melchior Canus</hi> avouched.</p>
                  <p>Neither will it helpe to say, that auricular confession was an article of faith in the Apostles time, but not then revealed to the Church. For as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus hath told vs plainly, the Church receiveth no newe revelations of faith.</p>
                  <p>This doctrine is confirmed by their famous Cardinall Caietan, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voucheth two speciall grounds against popish auricular confession. For <note place="margin">Caietan. super Ioan. cap. 20.</note> first, although Christ by his opinion instituted confession, yet did he make it voluntarie, and left it in mans election, whether he would confesse, or not confesse. Againe, he telleth vs that the manner of popish confession, to wit, to confesse secretly in the priests eare, was not ordeined by our Saviour Christ. Out of which assertion, <hi>I</hi> inferre a double conclusion against the Papistes. The one, that confession is not necessarie to salvation. For that which is voluntarie, as to be a Monke, a Nunne, a Priest, a Iesuite; is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie to salvation, as every papist graunteth: but is as a counsell, &amp; worke of supererogation. The other, that popish lawe vrging men to auricular confession, is flat against Christs institution. And thus I weene, I have proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved this conclusion.</p>

               <div n="6" type="conclusion">
                  <head>The sixt Conclusion.</head>
                  <p>IF Popish confession were ordeined by Christ, as the papists falsely and grossely imagine: yet would it followe by a necessarie consecution, that every Pope should be in daunger of his salvation. This conclusion may seeme somewhat strange: but I proove the fame. By popish doctrine every man and every woman of lawfull yeeres, are bound vnder paine of damnation, to the said confession; and consequently, the Pope beeing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man, or at least woman, (as is thought of pope Iohn,) is strictly bound vnto the same. Now syr, how our Pope his holinesse shall come to confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:1677:86"/>
and have absolution of his sinnes, <hi>hoc opus, hic labor est.</hi> And that the reader may fully vnderstand the difficultie herein: it is to be noted, that no priest can absolve any person from his sinnes, over whome he hath not su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perioritie and iurisdiction but, his holines hath both the swords, his power is above Kings and Emperiours, and over him no mortall creature, no not an Angel of heaven, hath any iurisdiction at all, as holdeth popish faith. The Pope then being subiect to none, &amp; must yet be absolved of some; which some, must haue iurisdiction over him; standeth doubtles in great perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and in no small danger of his saluation. Let us therefore find some poore shift, to helpe his holines if it may be. What if we say, that the Pope hath no mortal sinne, &amp; so is not bound to popish absolution. But, alas, all Popes are not Saints, as is prooved, and so some must perforce have absolution. Let us say, that he may absolue himselfe, as well as he may graunt pardons to him selfe. But, alas, that implyeth contradiction: because so he remaining one and the same man, should be both superiour and inferiour to himselfe: supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, as he did absolve: and inferiour, as absolved. Let vs say, that he volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily submitteth himselfe, and so receiueth absolution. But, alas, so shall his holines still be inferiour to the silly priest: because as S. Paul discourseth to the Hebrewes, he that blesseth, is greater then he that is blessed. Let us say, <note place="margin">Hebr. 7. <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> that the Pope giueth to the priest power ouer him, for that time onely. But, alas, that would be a rare and strange metamorphosis, with an impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie annexed therevnto. For first, by this meanes the simple priest should be Pope in time of absolution, as having then greatest power upon earth. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, after absolution, he that was pope, should cease to be pope: and he <note place="margin">Argumentum ad hominem.</note> that was not pope, should without election or consecration, be pope again. Which is a thing impossible, euen by popish proceeding. Let vs say, that some other pope hath given this auctoritie to the priest. But, alas, that can not possibly be graunted. For this is a constant axiome with the papists: <hi>par in parem non habet potestatem.</hi> When two are of equall auctoritie, the one can not make a law for, or against the other. Well, since none of these waies can content his holines; let vs heare what his owne deare vassals can say in his defense.</p>

                  <p>Master <hi>Canus</hi> bringeth three opinions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the first is, of S. Thomas and S. Bonaventure, to whome agreeth Turrecremata. The second is, the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Paludanus, who avoucheth that the Priest receiveth his authoritie, not from the Pope, but from Christ him selfe. The third opinion is Caie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, who affirmeth, that the Priest hath authority to absolve the Pope, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from Christ, nor from the Pope, nor from the Church, but onely by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection: to wit, in that the Pope submitteth him selfe to the Priest, and chooseth him. And there is yet a fourth opinion, which holdeth that as in receiving of priesthoode, power of iurisdiction is given to every simple priest, in respect of veniall sinnes, and of those mortalls which the penitent nath otherwise confessed, and also in respect of every sinner in the point of death: so is iurisdiction then given to the said Priest, that he may absolve the Pope.</p>
                  <p>Thus saith our reverend bishop, and worthie fryer <hi>Ioseph.</hi> Out of whose words I note;</p>
                  <p n="1">1 First, that since our Lord is the God of peace, and not of dissention, as recordeth his holy Apostle in many places: it must needes follow, that this popish doctrine is not of God, which is so devided against it selfe: and <note place="margin">1. Thess. 5. 23. 2. Thess. 3. 16. 1. Cor. 14. 33.</note> therefore said Caietain truely, though vnwittingly, and to another ende: when he denied the priest to have his authoritie, from Christ, or from his Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 I note secondly, that their doctrine is meere opinative, as which is onely grounded vpon mans invention.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 I note thirdly, that as the priestes iurisdiction is vncerten, so is the Popes absolution also, as which is consectarie therevnto: and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Pope standeth in daunger of his salvation. And so, if I be not deceived, the obscuritie of this conclusion is made evident.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HAVE in this discourse (gentle Reader) brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confuted ten special articles, of popish faith and religion.</p>

            <p n="2">2 Secondly, that the Pope both may erre, and hath erred <hi>defacto,</hi> not only as a priuate person in priuate opinion: but euen as Pope and publike person, in iudicial definitions.</p>
            <p n="3">3 Thirdly, that generall councels in these latter daies, are nothing els but a meere mockerie &amp; sophistical subtiltie, to deceiue Gods people withal.</p>
            <p n="4">4 Fourthly, that the Popes dispensations are wicked, licentious, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable.</p>
            <p n="5">5 Fiftly, that Kings are above Popes: that their power is independent: &amp; that they are subiect to none, but to God alone.</p>
            <p n="6">6 Sixtly, that popish dissention is of matters most important, and incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible to such, as are not wel acquainted with their bookes.</p>
            <p n="7">7 Seaventhly, that the writings of the auncient fathers, are to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with great reuerence: yet so, as we acknowledge them to be men, to haue their errours, and to binde vs to their authorities no further, then they accord with the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Eightly, that all things necessarie for our salvation, are conteined in the holy Scriptures; and that popish traditions are so vncerten, as the best learned papists can not agree therein.</p>
            <p n="9">9 Ninthly, that after this life, there is neither merite, nor demerite, nor sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to be made: and that the booke of <hi>Machabees,</hi> can not establish popish purgatorie.</p>
            <p n="10">10 Tenthly, that the specificall enumeration and confession of all our sinnes: is not onely not commaunded by the Scriptures, but repugnant to the same, and impossible to be accomplished by the power of man.</p>
            <p>All which points I have prooued, not onely by Scriptures, authorities, and reasons; but euen by the expresse testimonies, of best learned papists. A thing heretofore never performed by any, to my knowledge: and yet so
