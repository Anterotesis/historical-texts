            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>For my ſelf I was an eye-witneſſe of much here related, living more than two years at the Court of that mighty Monarch the great <hi>Mogol,</hi> (who prides himſelf very much in his moſt famous Anceſtor <hi>Tamberlane)</hi> in the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of whoſe Empire, your Highneſſe may meet with large Territories, a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Court, moſt populous, pleaſant, and rich Provinces, but when all theſe ſhall be laid in the Balance againſt his miſerable blindneſſe, your Highneſſe ſhall have more cauſe to pity, than envy his greatneſſe.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:115803:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I am not ambitious to make this my Relation publick, and therefore if it conſume more paper, it ſhall not be my fault: As it is, in a fearfull boldneſſe 'tis offered to your Princely hands, and if it may be any way pleaſing and uſefull, I have my reward; if not, my moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſires to have miniſtred ſomething this way unto your Highneſſe, ſhall be my comfort.</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>Thus <hi>(Reader)</hi> thou heareſt when this Relation was firſt written, and into what hands it was then put: And although there be now a very great ſpace of time 'twixt the particulars then obſerved, and their publication now; which may make thee look upon that which is here brought forth <hi>as an untimely birth,</hi> or as a thing <hi>born out of due time.</hi> Therefore know (which may give thee ſome ſatisfaction herein) that for the commodities, and diſcommodities of thoſe remote parts; for the cuſtomes and manners of that people; for their Religion and policie, with every
<pb facs="tcp:115803:4"/>
thing beſide (wherein thou mayeſt deſire information) which lies within the vaſt compaſſe of that huge Monarchy expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Map, and further deſcribed in this following diſcourſe (time not making that people at all to varie from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) thou mayeſt look upon it now, as if it hath been taken notice of, but imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before it was here communicated; and if it prove uſefull now, I ſhall be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glad that it was reſerved even for this preſent time, wherein it might do ſome good.</p>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding this, it ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been brought by me into this more open view, (eſpecially in ſuch a ſcribling writing age as this) <hi>where there is no end of making many books;</hi> (and many of thoſe written to no end, but what is evil and miſchievous) but that the Printer, who had gotten my Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Copie, preſented as before, deſired to publiſh it. And becauſe ſo, I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, and in ſome particulars by perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, though in ſome places very long di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſsions
<pb facs="tcp:115803:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(which I would intreat the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to improve) ſo enlarged it; that it may, (if it reach my aim) contain matter for inſtruction and uſe, as well as for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and novelty. So that they, who fly from a Sermon, and will not touch ſound, and wholeſom, and excellent treatiſes in Divinity, may happily (if God ſo pleaſe) be taken before they are aware, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by ſome Divine truths that lie ſcattered up and down in manie pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this Narrative. To which end I have endeavoured ſo to contrive it for every one (who ſhall pleaſe to read it through) that it may be like a well form'd picture, that ſeems to look ſtedfaſtly upon everie heholder, who ſo looks upon it.</p>
            <p>But here Reader, let us ſit down and wonder that in theſe dayes (which are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led times of Reformation) manie choiſe books are often publiſhed, which contain in themſelves, and declare unto others very much of the minde of God: yet are laid aſide, as if they were not worth the looking into, and in their ſtead <hi>Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:115803:5"/>
and other Pamphlets, <hi>ejuſdem fari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae,</hi> of the like kinde, which do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, but corrupt rather the mindes of thoſe, which look ſo much into them, teaching wickedneſſe while they ſeem to reprove it, are the books (O times!) which are generally call'd for, bought up, read, and liked.</p>
            <p>When a Traveller ſometimes obſerved the women in <hi>Rome</hi> to pleaſe themſelves in, and overmuch to play with their Curs, and Monkeys; he asked whether or no the women of <hi>Rome</hi> did not bear Children to delight themſelves withall. The ſtorie is ſo parallel to what I before obſerved; that he who runs may make Application, and therefore I forbear to do it.</p>
            <p>As for that I have here publiſhed I know,—<hi>habent ſua fata libelli,</hi> that books have their Fates, as well as their Authors; and therefore this Relation now it is got into the World, muſt take its chance, whatſoever its ſucceſſe, or acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance be: But however I ſhall never be of their minde, who think thoſe books beſt,
<pb facs="tcp:115803:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which beſt ſell, when certain it is that they are not to be valued by their good ſale, but good uſe.</p>
            <p>Which while ſome may make of this; others who love to carp, and cenſure, and quarrel (ſo as <hi>to make a man an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for a word)</hi> may put harſh interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upon ſome paſſages they may find in this following diſcourſe. <hi>Mala mens, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus animus,</hi> an evil minde in it ſelf, is an evil minde to all others. 'Twas ſaid of <hi>Diogenes</hi> that he was <hi>tuba convitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum;</hi> the <hi>Trumpet</hi> of <hi>reproaches;</hi> and that when he accuſed <hi>Plato</hi> of pride, he beat it down with greater pride. The <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marians</hi> were laughed at for taking ſo much pains to find out the faults of <hi>Ulyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and would not take notice of any of their own. They are the worſt of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that breed in, and delight to be ever ſtirring up and down in corruption. But I would have all, who have an eye ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too far out of their heads, and are therefore apt to ſee more in others than themſelves, and conſequently may obſerve
<pb facs="tcp:115803:6"/>
more than is meant, from ſome paſſages of this book, to bound all their conceivings a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to what they may finde here within the compaſſe of it, by that rule, which holds good in charity and law, and is true in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity likewiſe, <hi>in dubiis benigniora,</hi> that when any thing delivered may bear two interpretations, to take the faireſt.</p>
            <p>And now that this following relation may not appear to be a loſſe, either of time or paper, he that ſhall pleaſe to read it, in our paſſage to <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> may obſerve very large foot-ſteps of the Almighty in his works of Creation &amp; Providence. And when I have brought him thither on ſhore he may finde that there is not one que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion (as before) of any conſequence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe parts I have undertaken to write of, but it findes ſatisfaction in one part or other of this diſcourſe.

            <p>And then he may further behold, ſuch <hi>Temperance, Juſtice,</hi> unwearied <hi>devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (but in a wrong way) with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther excellent <hi>Moralitics</hi> ſo to ſhine its them; that by this very light, he may ſee

            <p>But I ſhall not further anticipate my diſcourſe, in being like a vain-glorious entertainer, who fills the ears of his gueſts with his diſhes, before they ſee, or taſte them. Which if thou ſhall pleaſe to do, read on, and thou art very welcome how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>

Now that it ſhould be ſo here, and not known ſo to be in any part of the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide I ever heard of, if not in thoſe winds, which they ſay are ſometimes ſold by the <hi>Lapland</hi> Witches, I can give no reaſon for it, unleſſe Satan (who is moſt Tyrannicall where he is moſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed) that Prince of the Ayr ſeems to rule more here, than hee doth in other parts.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115803:19"/>
thoſe ſlimy, unwholſome, hot, and unſavorie ſhowres, whereſoever it ſtood, would preſently bring forth many little offenſive Creatures. Theſe Turnadoes met with us when we were about 12. Degrees of North Latitude, and kept us company ere they quitted us, two Degrees South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the Equinoctial, under which we paſſed the 28. of <hi>April.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 19th of <hi>May</hi> being Whitſunday, wee paſſed the Tropick of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> ſo that we were ſeven weeks compleat under the <hi>Torrid Zone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Between the Tropicks wee ſaw (almoſt every day) different kinds of fiſhes, in greater abundance than elſe-where, as the great <hi>Leviathan whom God hath made to take his paſtime in the Sea; Granpiſces,</hi> or leſſer whales, <hi>Sharkes, Turtles</hi> or <hi>Torteiſes, Dolphins, Bonitoes, Albicores, Porpiſces, Flying fiſhes,</hi> with many others. Some Whales we ſaw of an exceeding greatneſſe, who in calm weather often ariſe and ſhew themſelves on the top of the water, where they appear like unto great Rocks, in their riſe, ſpouting up into the Ayr with noyſe, a great quantity of water which falls down again about them like a ſhowr. The Whale may well challenge the Principalitie of the Sea, yet I ſuppoſe that he hath many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in this his large Dominion; for inſtance, a little long Fiſh called a Threſher often encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with him, who by his agilitie vexeth him as much in the Sea, as a little Bee in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115803:20"/>
doth a great Beaſt on the ſhore.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Shark</hi> hath not this name for nothing; for he will make a morſell of any thing he can catch, maſter and devour. Theſe <hi>Shark</hi> are moſt rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous fiſhes; fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Not much unlike many vile men, who think they may ſafely take any thing they can finger and get, and having been faſtned in, and eſcaped out of many Snares will take no warning but be ſtill nibling and biting at what they like not once conſidering that there is an hook within the bayt, that will take them at laſt, and hamper them to their unavoydable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.

Thoſe Fiſhes that thus keep him company, are called by the Mariners, <hi>Pilate-fiſhes,</hi> who alwayes ſhape their courſe the ſame way the Shark takes, and by conſequence (nature having made them ſo wary) he becomes their guard, they not his food. And there are other fiſhes too they call <hi>Sucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh,</hi> that ſtick as cloſe to the body of the Shark, as a Tike on the ſhore doth to the body of a Beaſt, and ſo receive their nouriſhment from him and he muſt be contented, for while he is ſwimming up and down, he cannot poſſibly free himſelf of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Many of theſe Sharks grow to a very large greatneſs; they have a broad roundhead, in which are three rowes of teeth very ſtrong and ſharp, by which they are able to take off the leg of a man at one bite, as ſome have found by wofull experience, while they have been careleſly ſwimming in theſe hot Seas, where theſe Sharks moſt uſe and certainly were they as nimble as they are miſchievous, would doe very much hurt.</p>

an houſe, which covers all within it. Thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave backs (like bucklets, but of an Oval ſhape) that cover theſe creatures, are many of them ſo exceeding ſtrong, that they will bear off the weight of a Cart-wheel. Theſe Torteiſes increaſe by eggs (as I have been often told) are very good to eat, the ſubſtance within them (whether you will call it fleſh or fiſh) firſt boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and after minced with butter, taſtes like but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Veal, Their ſhell makes (as is very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known) excellent good Combes, Cups, or Boxes, and further it is uſed by them in <hi>Eaſt-India,</hi> to make or adorn little or great Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binets.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dolphin</hi> is a fiſh called for his ſwiftneſſe the Arrow of the Sea differing in this one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular from all other fiſhes I ever obſerved, in that he hath many little teeth upon the top of his tongue. Hee is very pleaſing to the eye, ſmell and taſte, of a changeable colour, finn'd like a Roach, covered with many ſmall ſcales, having a freſh delightſome ſent above other fiſhes, and in taſte as good as any; theſe Dolphins are wont often to follow our ſhips, not ſo much I think for the love they bear unto man, (as ſome write,) as to feed themſelves with what they find caſt over board, whence it comes to paſs, that many times they feed us, for when they ſwim cloſe to our ſhips wee often ſtrike them with a broad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, full of barbs, called an Harping-iron,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115803:21"/>
faſtned to a roap, by which we hale them in; This Dolphin may be a fit Embleme of an ill race of people, who under ſweet countenances, carry ſharp tongues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bonitoes</hi> and <hi>Albicores,</hi> are in colour, ſhape, and taſte, much like unto Mackrels, and as good fiſh as they, but they grow to be very exceeding large.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Porpiſces</hi> or <hi>Hogfiſh,</hi> are like the former; very large and great, but better to look upon than to taſte; they uſually appear at Sea in very great ſholes or companies, and are (as if they came of the race of the <hi>Gadaren</hi> Swine, that ran violently into the Sea) very ſwift in their motion, and like a company matching in rank and file; They leap or mount very nimbly over th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> waves and ſo down and up again, making a melancholy noyſe, when they are above the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Theſe are uſually, when they thus appear, certain preſagers of very foul weather.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Flying fiſhes</hi> have skinny wings like unto Batts, but larger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are ſtifned and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with many little bones, ſuch as are in the back finns of Pearches, by which they fly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but a little way at a time; they have ſmall bodyes like unto Pilchers, and appear when they fly, in marvellous great companies, and ſome of them often fly into our ſhips, by which we have taſted that they are excellent good fiſh. Of all other, theſe flying Fiſhes live the moſt miſerable lives,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115803:22"/>
for being in the water, the Dolphins, Bonitoes, Albicores, and Porpiſces, chaſe perſecute and take them, and when they would eſcape by their flight, are oftentimes caught by ravenous Fowls, ſomewhat like our Kites, which hover over the water. Theſe flying Fiſhes are like men profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing two trades and thrive at neither.</p>
            <p>I could further enlarge, but my buſineſs is not to write an Hiſtory of <hi>Fiſhes,</hi> yet in thoſe wee have named, as in thouſands more which inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite that watery Main, I deſire with <hi>David,</hi> to admire and ſay, <hi>O Lord, how manifold are thy works;</hi> manifold, and wonderfull indeed, as he that will take notice, many obſerve every where, but in a ſpeciall manner (becauſe they are more rare) in the great varietie of ſtrange Creatures, which the Sea, that womb of moyſture, brings forth, in which many things we behold are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull, and many things beſides we cannot ſee, are certainly more full of wonder.</p>

               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:115803:22"/>
early in the morning, we eſpied our long-wiſhed for harbour the Bay of <hi>Souldania,</hi> about twelve leagues ſhort of the Cape of good Hope, where we came happily to an Ankor that forenoon. In which Bay we found a Dutch-ſhip bound for <hi>Bantam,</hi> which had taken in her courſe, and brought thither, a ſmall <hi>Portugal</hi> bound to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gola,</hi> a Colonie belonging to the <hi>Portugals,</hi> lying in the skirts of <hi>Africa,</hi> about ten degrees South of the Line; in which ſmall ſhip amongſt many rich Commodities (as we heard) to the value of five or ſix thouſand pounds ſterling, there were ten <hi>Portugal</hi> Virgins (as they call'd themſelves) ſent to that Colonie I ſuppoſe for Husbands. The young women were well-favoured, and well clad in ſilks, but ſuch were the courteſies of theſe Dutch-men towards them, as that they took not only away all the goods, Artilerie, and good proviſions of their ſhip, but they rob'd theſe poor captive Maidens of all their apparell, (which they moſt ſadly complained of) to one poor ſuit (and I ſuppoſe of their honour too, if they brought it with them) then giving them water for their wine, and a very ſcant proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all other proviſions, turn'd them with their unarm'd, leakie, and ill-man'd ſhip, to the mercy of the Seas, the twentieth day following.</p>
            <p>This Bay of <hi>Souldania</hi> lyeth in 34 degrees and half of South Latitude in a ſweet Climate, full of fragrant herbs (which the ſoyl produceth of its
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115803:23"/>
ſelf) pleaſing to the ſenſe, where our ſhips com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, when they have often-times there arrived, with very weak and feeble bodies, uſually by that Sea diſeaſe the Scurvy, in which diſeaſe (I ſhall obſerve by the way) if any that have it, be not too much overgone with it, aſſoon as hee comes to enjoy the freſh ayr on any ſhore, with freſh water, and freſh food he will preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover; but if this diſeaſe have over-much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on him, immediatly after he ſets his foot on ſhore, he uſually dies. I ſay our people when they have come hither with very crazie bodies, have often found here much good refreſhing; for beſides a moſt delectable brook of pure good water, ariſing hard by, out of a mighty hill (call'd for its form the Table, cloſe by which there is another Hill, which ariſeth exceeding high like a Pyramis, and called by Paſſengers the Sugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaf) there are good ſtore of Cattell, as little Beeves, called by the barbarous Inhabitants. Boos; and Sheep which they call Baas, who bear a ſhort coarſe hairie wooll, and I conceive are never ſhorn. Theſe Boos and Baas, (as they call them) were formerly bought in great plenty, for ſmall quantities of Kettle-braſſe, and Iron Hoops, taken off our Empty Cask; (which are all for this long voyage hoop'd with Iron.) Theſe Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges had their cattell which we bought of them, at a very great Command, for with a call they would preſently run to them, and when they had
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115803:23"/>
ſold any one of their bullooks to us, for a little inconſiderate peece of braſſe, if we did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently knock him down, they would by the ſame call, make the poor creature break from us and run unto them again, and then there was no get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them out of their hands, but by giving them more braſſe, and by this trick now and then, they ſold the ſame beaſt unto us, two or three times; and if they had thus ſold him more often, he had been a good penny worth; how ever in this wee might obſerve, the covetouſneſs and deceit of this brutiſh people. Here yee muſt know that this people of all metals ſeem to love braſſe, I think (as you may gheſſe afterward) for the rankneſſe of its ſmell; with which they make great rings to wear about their wriſts; yea, ſo taken are they with this baſe metall that if a man lay down before them a peece of gold worth two pounds ſterling, and a peece of braſſe worth two pence, they will leave the Gold, and take the braſſe On this ſhore there likewiſe are found excellent good, though ſmall roots for Salads, which the ſoyl brings forth without husbanding. And in the head of the Bay, may be taken with netts, great ſtore of fayr fat Mullets, of which we took abundance.</p>
            <p>This remoteſt part of <hi>Africa,</hi> is very moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous, over-run with wild beaſts, as Lions, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gres, Wolves, and many other beaſts of prey, which in the ſilent night diſcover themſelves by
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115803:24"/>
their noyſe and roaring; to the Teeth and Jawes of which cruell Beaſts, the Natives here expoſe their old people, if death prevent it not, when once they grow very old and troubleſome, laying them forth in ſome open place in the dark night, <hi>When the wild beaſts</hi> (as <hi>David</hi> obſerves, <hi>Pſal. 104. 20, 21.) doe creep forth, and the young lyons roar after their prey.</hi> One miſerable poor old wretch was thus expoſed when we were there, who by his pittifull cryes, was diſcovered by our Court of Guard, there on ſhore, and not far off from him, and by them relieved and delivered for that preſent time, out of the jawes of Death; And wee asking <hi>Coorce</hi> one of the Natives (whoſe ſtory you ſhall have by and by) why they did ſo, he told us, it was their cuſtome, when their people had lived ſo long, that they knew not what to doe with them, thus to be rid of them.</p>
            <p>Wee ſaw in this Bay of <hi>Souldania</hi> many Whales, and about the ſhore divers party-colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Fowles; And here are Oſtriches to be ſeen. For the ſoyl about the Bay, it ſeems to be very good, but the Sun ſhines not upon a people in the whole world, more barbarous than thoſe which poſſeſſe it; Beaſts in the skins of men, rather than men in the skins of beaſts, as may appear by their ignorance, habit, language, diet, with other things, which make them moſt brutiſh.</p>

Firſt for God, the great God of Heaven and Earth, whom generally all the people in the world, Heathen, as well as Chriſtians doe confeſs, they (as this <hi>Cooree</hi> told us) acknowledge none. For their ſpeech it ſeemed to us inarticulate noyſe rather than Language, like the clucking of Hens, or gabling of Turkeys; and thus making a very ſtrange confuſed noyſe, when they walk here or there: if there be two or three, or five, or ten, or twenty, or very many more in company, it is their manner to walk in rank one after the other, in ſmall paths they have made by their thus walking, as Kine in Summer many times doe, when they come home to the Payl; or as wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geeſe who fly in ranks, and as they fly make a noyſe; ſo theſe walking together thus gabble from the firſt to the laſt in company, as if all ſpake, but none anſwered. Their Habits are their ſheeps skins undreſt, thonged together, which cover their bodies to the middle, with a little flap of the ſame skin tyed before them, being naked downward, and when tis cold keep the woolly, when hotter weather, the fleſhy ſide of thoſe skins next to their bodies. Their ornaments and Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els. Bullocks or ſheeps-guts full of excrement, about their necks, and therefore when we bought their Cattell they would take (and we were content they ſhould) their skins, guts, and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bage, which plentifully furniſhed them with that rich attire, and gay ornaments; and when they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115803:25"/>
were hungry, they would ſit down upon ſome hillock, firſt ſhaking out ſome of that filthy pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out of the guts they wore about their necks, then bowing and bringing their mouths to their hands, almoſt as low as their knees, like hungry doggs would gnaw, and eat the raw guts, when you may conceive their mouths full of ſweet green ſawce. The women as the men are thus adorned, thus habited, and thus dieted only they wear more about their lower parts than the men. And (by the way) theſe carry their ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infants under their skins upon their backs, and their breſts hanging down like Bag-pipes, they put up with their hands to their children, that they may ſuck them over their ſhoulders. Both ſexes make coverings for their heads like to skull caps, with Cow-dung, and ſuch like filth mingled with a little ſtinking greaſe, with which they likewiſe beſmear their faces, which makes their company unſufferable, if they get the wind of you. I obſerved, that ſome of the reſt of their dyet was agreeable to the former, for they would eat any refuſe thing, as rotten and mouldy Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, which we have given them, fit indeed for nothing but to be caſt away; yea, they will eat that which a ravenous dog in <hi>England</hi> will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe. I once tooke notice of a Couple of them, who had found on the neighbouring ſhore a large piece of a dead fiſh the Sea had caſt up, which did moſt ſufficiently ſtink, they preſently made a
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115803:25"/>
little fire with dry Cow-dung, and with this they warm'd it, and then they eat it, with as much ſeeming appetite, as an hungry man with us, would feed upon a very choyſe and ſavoury diſh, which makes me almoſt to believe, that thoſe wretched creatures have but three ſenſes, wanting the benefit both of Smelling and Taſting. They lodge upon the earth in Hovels, ſo ill covered, that they keep not out the weather, made like to thoſe we call Summer-houſes, with Boughs and ſticks.</p>

            <p>Me thinks when I have ſeriouſly conſidered, the Dreſſes the Habitations, and the Diet of this people, with other things, and how theſe beaſts
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115803:26"/>
of Mankind live all like Brutes, nay worſe, I have thought that if they had the accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wee enjoy (to make our lives more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable) by good dwelling, warm clothing, ſweet lodging, and wholſome food, they would be abundantly pleaſed with ſuch a change of their condition; For as Love proceeds from Knowledge, and liking; and we can neither love nor like any thing we cannot know: ſo when we come to a ſenſible underſtanding of things wee knew not before; when the Belly teaches, and the Back inſtructs a man would believe that theſe ſhould work ſome ſtrong convictions. But I ſhall here inſert a ſhort ſtory; About three years before I went to <hi>India,</hi> it happened, that one of the Companie ſhips returning thence, and arriving at this barbour, after a little ſtay, when ſhe was ready to ſet ſayl for <hi>England,</hi> and having then two of theſe Salvages aboard, her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander reſolv'd to bring them both home with him, thinking that when they had got ſome Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh here they might diſcover ſomething of their Country which we could not know before. Theſe poor wretches being thus brought away, very much againſt both their minds, one of them (meerly out of extreme ſullenneſs though he was very well uſed) died ſhortly after they put to Sea, the other who call'd himſelf <hi>Cooree</hi> (whom I mentioned before) lived and was brought to <hi>London,</hi> and there kept, for the ſpace
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115803:26"/>
of ſix moneths, in Sir <hi>Thomas Smith</hi>'s houſe (then Governour of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company) where he had good diet good clothes, good lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with all other fitting accommodations; now one would think that this wretch might have conceived his preſent, compared with his former condition, an Heaven upon earth, but he did not ſo, though he had to his good entertainment made for him a Chain of bright Braſſe, an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, Breſt, Back, and Head-piece, with a Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler all of Braſſe, his beloved Metall, yet all this contented him not, for never any ſeemed to be more weary of ill uſage, than he was of Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies; none ever more deſirous to return home to his Countrey than he; For when he had learned a little of our Language, he would daily lye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, and cry very often thus in broken Engliſh, <hi>Cooree home goe, Souldania goe, home goe;</hi> And not long after when he had his deſire, and was returned home, he had no ſooner ſet footing on his own ſhore, but preſently he threw away his <hi>Clothes,</hi> his <hi>Linnen,</hi> with all other <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering,</hi> and got his ſheeps skins upon his back, guts about his neck, and ſuch a perfum'd Cap (as before we named) upon his head; by whom that Proverb mentioned, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 22. was lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally fulfill'd, <hi>Canis ad vomitum; The dogge is return'd to his vomit, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In the year 1614. ten Engliſh men having received the ſentence of death for their ſeverall crimes at the Seſſions houſe in the old-Baily at <hi>London,</hi> had their Execution reſpited by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Merchants, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that they ſhould be all baniſhed to this place, to the end (if they could find any peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble abode there) they might diſcover ſomething advantagious to their trade; And this was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly done.

And which made their condition while they were in it moſt extremely miſerable, it is a place wherein growes never a tree, either for ſuſtenance or ſhelter, or ſhade, nor any thing beſide (I ever heard of) to help ſuſtein nature; a place that hath never a drop of freſh water in it, but what the ſhowrs leave in the holes of the rocks. And beſides all this, there are a very great number of Snakes in that Iſland (as I have been told by many that have been upon it) ſo many of thoſe venemous worms that a man cannot tread ſafely in the long graſſe which growes in it, for fear of them; And all theſe put together muſt needs make that place beyond meaſure uncomfortable to theſe moſt wretched men. To this may be added their want of proviſion having nothing but dry Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, and no great quantity of that; ſo that they lived with hungry bellies, without any place fit for repoſe, without any quiet reſt, for they could not chooſe but ſleep in fear continually; And what outward condition could make men more miſerable than this? Yet notwithſtanding all they ſuffered, theſe ſeven vile wretches, all live to be made examples afterward of Divine Juſtice. For after they had continued in, and endured this ſad place for the ſpace of five or ſix moneths, and they were grown all even almoſt mad by reaſon of their ſeveral preſſing wants and extremities, it pleaſed

            <p>The year following we carried three more condemned perſons to be left in this place, but they hearing of the ill ſucceſſe of their predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, and that it was very unlikely for them to find any ſafe footing here, when we were ready to depart thence, and to leave them on the ſhore, they all came and preſented themſelves on their knees, with many tears in their eyes unto our chief Commander Captain <hi>Joſeph,</hi> moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beſeeching him, that he would give order that they might be <hi>hanged</hi> before he departed, in that <hi>place,</hi> which they much rather choſe, than to be there left; wee thought it was a very ſad ſight to behold three men in ſuch a condition, that made them eſteem <hi>hanging to be mercy.</hi> Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander told them, that he had no Commiſſion to execute them, but to leave them there, and ſo he muſt doe, and ſo believed he had done; But our fift ſhip the <hi>Swan</hi> ſtaying in this place after us a day or two, took theſe poor men into her, and then took her courſe for <hi>Bantam</hi> whither ſhe was bound.

We kept on in a circular courſe, to gain a South-weſt wind; for yee muſt know, that the wind in thoſe parts, and ſo in <hi>Eaſt-India,</hi> blows (and but with a very little variation) half the year South-weſt, and the other half North-Eaſt; we ſayled here Southerly, till we had raiſed the <hi>South-Pole</hi> almoſt forty degrees above the Horizon.

After this they returning back ſhewed them all that was to be ſeen in and about <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem.</hi> Many particulars they told them (ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which are there kept by Tradition) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> and his Mother: Then they had a ſight of as much of Mount <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varie</hi> (where our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> ſuffered) as could be ſhewed them, that Hill being now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed within the Wals of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> They undertook to ſhew them afterwards the place wherein our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> was buried; and

after that upon Mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> the very place whence he after aſcended, where upon a Rock there was an <hi>impreſſion</hi> of the former part of two <hi>feet,</hi> ſuch as is ſeen in ſoft earth, when a man lifts up his body to leap thence; and theſe <hi>Franciſcans</hi> confidently affirmed, and ſeemed undoubtedly to believe, that it was ſo as they ſhewed and told them. Many other things they affirmed, which being but Circumſtantials, (though appertaining to the beſt of all <hi>ſtories)</hi> were enough for theſe Pilgrims to <hi>believe,</hi> and enough to make <hi>doubt of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> this our Traveller had made upon the <hi>Wriſts</hi> of his left <hi>Arm</hi> the Arms of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> a <hi>Croſs Croſſed,</hi> or <hi>Croſslets;</hi> and on the <hi>Wriſt</hi> of his <hi>right,</hi> a ſingle <hi>Croſs</hi> made like that our Bleſſed Saviour ſuffered on; and on the ſides of the <hi>ſtem</hi> or <hi>tree</hi> of that <hi>Croſs</hi> theſe words written, <hi>Via, Veritas, Vita<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> ſome of the letters being put on the one ſide of that ſtem or tree, and ſome of them on the other; and at the foot of that <hi>Croſs</hi> three <hi>Nails,</hi> to ſignifie thoſe which faſtned our <hi>Saviour</hi> unto it: All theſe impreſſions were made by ſharp <hi>Needles</hi> bound together, that pierced onely the skin, and then a black Powder put into the Places ſo pierced, which became preſently indelible <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters,</hi> to continue with him ſo long as his fleſh ſhould be covered with <hi>skin:</hi> And they were done upon his Arms ſo artificially, as if they had

been drawn by ſome accurate Pencil upon Parchment. This poor man would pride him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf very much in the beholding of thoſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and ſeeing them would often ſpeak thoſe words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> written to the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Gal.</hi> 6. 17.

            </p>
            <p>Now after that himſelf and Camrade had ſeen what they deſired in and about <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they took their leave of thoſe <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with them money to recompence the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſy they had received from them; the <hi>Friars</hi> being very poor, and conſequently unable to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain them freely without requitals.</p>
            <p>From hence they took their way to take a view of the <hi>Dead Sea</hi> (ſo called, either becauſe the water therein is ſtill, and moves not, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no living Creature is in it, and nothing thrives on the banks thereof) the place where <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and <hi>Admah</hi> and <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boim</hi> once ſtood, thoſe Cities <hi>which Almighty God overthrew in anger, and repented not,</hi> Jer. 20. 16. Hence they went to have a ſight of the River <hi>Jordan,</hi> which diſchargeth it ſelf into that moſt uncomfortable <hi>Lake;</hi> and from hence they journied <hi>North-eaſt</hi> through thoſe <hi>ten Tribes,</hi> (which for the ſin of <hi>Salomon</hi> were rent from his ſon <hi>Rehoboam)</hi> till they came to Mount <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus.</hi> Thence back to <hi>Sidon,</hi> which retaineth

And here he told me as his laſt obſervation made in that Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaan,</hi> ſometimes <hi>(like the Garden of the Lord)</hi> flowing with <hi>milk and honey,</hi> being then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with a very great variety, and abundance of Gods good Creatures; and in the daies of <hi>David</hi> ſo populous, that there were numbred in it at one time <hi>thirteen hundred thouſand fighting men,</hi> 2 Sam. 24. 9. beſides Women and Children, and others unfit to draw ſwords; which was a moſt wonderful thing, to conſider that ſuch a ſpot of ground in compariſon, not above one <hi>hundred</hi> and <hi>ſixty</hi> miles in length, from <hi>Dan</hi> to <hi>Beerſheba,</hi> and not above <hi>ſixty</hi> miles in bredth, from <hi>Joppa</hi> to <hi>Jordan,</hi> ſhould be able to bear and feed ſuch a numerous people; and now the very ſelf-ſame tract of Earth, either for want of manuring, or (which is rather to be conceived) for the want of the bleſſing of Almighty God which once ſhined upon it, but now long ſince withdrawn from it, <hi>(For a fruitful Land the Lord makes barren for the wickedneſs of them that dwell therein,</hi> Pſal. 107. 34.) is now become unable to ſuſtein one in an hundred of ſuch a number.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Sidon</hi> they got a paſſage by Sea unto <hi>Alexandretta,</hi> now called <hi>Scanderoon</hi> (in the extremeſt bottom of the <hi>Mediterranean Sea)</hi> which is one of the unwholſomeſt places in the World; where I have often heard that no

Stranger (that was born far from it) comes to continue there for the ſpace of one Month, but is ſure to meet with a ſickneſs, which very often proves Mortal. At this place his Engliſh Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion left him, and turned his face towards <hi>England,</hi> and he preſently took his way towards <hi>Aleppo</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> about ſeventy miles or more diſtant from <hi>Scanderoon,</hi> which is as much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned for wholſomneſs, as the place before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named for being unwholſome; and therfore it is called, <hi>ſweet-air'd Aleppo.</hi> Here he being kindly received by the <hi>Engliſh Conſul,</hi> ſtayed a time to gain the company of a <hi>Carava<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

With theſe he after ſet forwards towards, and to that City antiently called <hi>Nineveh</hi> in <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> which we find in the Propheſie of <hi>Jonah</hi> was ſometimes <hi>a great and excellent City of three daies journey,</hi> Jonah 3. 3. but now ſo exceedingly leſſen'd and lodg'd in obſcurity, that paſſengers cannot ſay of it, <hi>this was Nineveh,</hi> which now hath its old name changed, and is called <hi>Mozel.</hi> From hence they journied to <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated upon the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> once likewiſe ſo great that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> called it a <hi>Countrey,</hi> not

a <hi>City,</hi> but now it is very much contracted, and 'tis called <hi>Bagdat.</hi> From this place they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded through both the <hi>Armeniaes,</hi> and either did, or elſe our Traveller was made to believe, that he ſaw the very Mountain <hi>Ararat</hi> whereon the <hi>Ark of Noah reſted after the Flood,</hi> Gen. 8. And from hence they went forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Kingdome of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and there to <hi>Uzſpahan,</hi> the uſual place of reſidence for that great King, then called <hi>Sha Abbas,</hi> or <hi>King Abbas.</hi> And after they went to <hi>Seras,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently called <hi>Shuſhan,</hi> where the <hi>great King Ahaſuerus</hi> kept his Royal and moſt Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Court, <hi>Eſt.</hi> 1 From hence they journied afterwards to <hi>Candahor,</hi> the firſt Province North eaſt under the ſubjection of the Great <hi>Mogol</hi> and ſo to <hi>Lahore</hi> the chiefeſt City but one belonging to that great Empire; a place, as I have been often told by <hi>Tom: Coryat</hi> and others of very great <hi>trade, wealth</hi> and <hi>delight,</hi> lying more temperately out of the Parching Sun than any other of his great Cities do: And to this City he wanted not Company, nor afterwards to <hi>Agra,</hi> the <hi>Mogol's Metropolis</hi> or chief City.</p>
            <p>And here it is very obſervable, that from <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hore</hi> to <hi>Agra</hi> it is four hundred Engliſh miles, &amp; that the Countrey betwixt both theſe great Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties is rich, even, pleaſant and flat, a <hi>Campania;</hi> and the rode-way on both ſides all this long di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:115803:50"/>
planted with great <hi>Trees</hi> which are all the year cloathed with leaves exceeding beneficial unto Travellers for the ſhade they afford them in thoſe hot Climes. This very much extended length of way 'twixt theſe two places is called by Travellers the <hi>Long Walk,</hi> very full of <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages</hi> and <hi>Towns</hi> for Paſſengers every where to find Proviſion.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Agra</hi> our Traveller made an halt, being there lovingly received in the <hi>Engliſh Factory,</hi> where he ſtaid till he had gotten to his <hi>Turkiſh,</hi> and <hi>Moriſco</hi> or <hi>Arabian</hi> Languages, ſome good knowledge in the <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Indoſtan Tongues,</hi> in which ſtudy he was alwaies very apt. and in little time ſhowed much proficiency. The firſt of thoſe two, the <hi>Perſian,</hi> is the more <hi>quaint;</hi> the other, the <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> the vulgar <hi>Language</hi> ſpoken in <hi>Eaſt-India:</hi> In both theſe he ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly got ſuch a knowledge and maſtery, that it did exceedingly afterwards advantage him in his Travels up and down the <hi>Mogol</hi>'s Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, he wearing alwaies the <hi>Habit</hi> of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſpeaking their <hi>Language.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt of theſe, the <hi>Perſian</hi> tongue, he made afterwards an <hi>Oration</hi> to the Great <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gol,</hi> bringing in that Story of the <hi>Queen of She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba,</hi> 1 King. 10.

came from far to viſit him, which when ſhe had done, ſhe confeſſed that though ſhe had heard very much of him and many things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond her belief, yet now ſeeing what ſhe did, acknowledged that ſhe had not heard half of that which ſhe now ſaw concerning the <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> and <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> and <hi>Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>inue,</hi> and <hi>Riches of Salomon:</hi> So our <hi>Orator</hi> told the <hi>Mogol,</hi> that he had heard very much of him before he had the Honour to ſee him (when he was very far off in his own Countrey) but now what he beheld did exceedingly ſurmount all thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Reports of him which came to his ears at ſuch a diſtance from him: Then larding his ſhort Speech with ſome other pieces of Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, which the <hi>Mogol</hi> liked well, conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: And when he had done, the <hi>Mogol</hi> gave him one hundred <hi>Roopus,</hi> which amounts to the value of <hi>twelve pounds</hi> and <hi>ten ſhillings</hi> of of our Engliſh Money; looking upon him as a <hi>Derveeſe,</hi> or Votary, or Pilgrim (for ſo he called him) and ſuch as bear that name in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey ſeem not much to care for money, and that was the reaſon (I conceive) that he gave him not a more plentiful Reward.</p>
            <p>After this he having got a great maſtery like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the <hi>Indoſtan</hi> or more vulgar Language, there was a woman, a Landreſs, belonging to my Lord <hi>Embaſſadors houſe,</hi> who had ſuch a freedome and liberty of ſpeech, that ſhe would

            <p>I ſhall have occaſion to ſay more of this man in ſome paſſages of this following Diſcourſe, and therefore ſhall not wrap all I have to ſpeak of him in this, although it be a very long di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion: Yet becauſe I muſt now ſhortly bring you to his journies end, I ſhall take the freedome to enlarge my ſelf a little further concerning him here in this place, before I leave him for the preſent; and to give thee, <hi>Reader,</hi> a piece of his <hi>Character,</hi> it ſpeaks thus:</p>
            <p>That he was a man of a very coveting <hi>eye, that could never be ſatisfied with ſeeing,</hi> as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1. 8. though he had ſeen very much; and I am perſwaded that he took as much content in <hi>ſeeing,</hi> as many others in the <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying</hi> of <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Rare</hi> things. He was a man that had got the maſtery of many hard Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges (as before I obſerved) to the <hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> he brought forth of <hi>England</hi> with him; in which, if he had obtained wiſdome to huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and manage them as he had skill to ſpeak them, he had deſerved more fame in his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. But his knowledge and high attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in ſeveral Languages made him not a little ignorant of himſelf, he being ſo covetous,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:115803:52"/>
ſo ambitious of <hi>praiſe,</hi> that he would <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>endure</hi> more of it than he could in any meaſure <hi>deſerve;</hi> being like a Ship that hath too much <hi>Sail,</hi> and too little <hi>Ballaſt:</hi> Yet if he had not fall'n into the ſmart hands of the Wits of thoſe Times, he might have paſſed better. That itch of <hi>Fame</hi> which engaged this man to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings of thoſe very hard, and long, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Travels, hath put thouſands more (and therefore he was not alone in this) into ſtrange attempts onely to be talked of.</p>
            <p>One long ago <hi>built</hi> a Temple to <hi>Diana</hi> in hope of <hi>Glory,</hi> intending it for one of the Great Wonders of the World; Another after in hope of <hi>Fame burnt</hi> it. Whither will not the thirſt of <hi>Fame</hi> carry men! It hath made ſome ſeek to climbe up to <hi>Heaven,</hi> though by a wrong way: Thus the Builders of <hi>Babel</hi> ſay one to another, <hi>Let us build us a City, and a Tower, whoſe top may reach up to Heaven, and let us make us a Name,</hi> Gen. 11. 4 And it hath made others, who are <hi>penurious</hi> of their <hi>Honour,</hi> and <hi>prodigal</hi> of their <hi>Souls,</hi> not fear to run down headlong into <hi>Hell.</hi> 'Twas <hi>Fame,</hi> without doubt, that ſtirred up this man unto theſe voluntary, but hard underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings, and the Hope of that <hi>Glory</hi> which he ſhould reap after he had finiſhed his long <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels,</hi> made him not at all to take notice of the <hi>hardſhip he found in them.</hi> That hope of name and repute for the time to come did even feed
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:115803:52"/>
and feaſt him for the time preſent. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any thing that did in any meaſure <hi>eclipſe him</hi> in thoſe high conceivings of his own worth, did too too much <hi>trouble him,</hi> which you may collect from theſe following inſtances.</p>
            <p>Upon a time one Mr. <hi>Richard Steel</hi> a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant and ſervant to the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company, came unto us from <hi>Surat</hi> to <hi>Mandoa,</hi> the place then of the <hi>Mogol</hi>'s reſidence (of which place ſomewhat more hereafter) at which time Mr. <hi>Coryat</hi> was there with us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This Merchant had not long before travelled over-land from <hi>Eaſt-India,</hi> through <hi>Perſia,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and ſo for <hi>England;</hi> who in his travel home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward had met with <hi>Tom: Coryat,</hi> as he was journeying towards <hi>Eaſt-India;</hi> Mr. <hi>Steel</hi> then told him, that when he was in <hi>England, King James</hi> (then living) enquired after him, and when he had certified the King of his meeting him on the way, the King replied, <hi>Is that Fool yet living?</hi> which, when our <hi>Pilgrim</hi> heard, it ſeemed to <hi>trouble</hi> him very much, becauſe the King ſpake no <hi>more</hi> nor no <hi>better</hi> of him; ſaying, that <hi>Kings</hi> would ſpeak of poor men what they pleaſed.</p>
            <p>At another time when he was ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from us, my Lord <hi>Embaſſadour</hi> gave him a Letter, and in that a Bill to receive ten pounds at <hi>Aleppo</hi> when he ſhould return thither: The Letter was directed unto Mr. <hi>Libbeus Chapman,</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:115803:53"/>
there <hi>Conſul</hi> at that time, in which that which concerned our Traveller was thus: Mr. <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> when you ſhall hand theſe Letters, I deſire you to receive the Bearer of them, Mr. <hi>Thomas Coryat,</hi> with curteſy, for you ſhall find him a very honeſt poor Wretch; and further I muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat you to furniſh him with ten pounds, which ſhall be repayed, &amp;c.

And furthermore he then told me, that when he was formerly undertaking his journey to <hi>Venice,</hi> a Perſon of Honour wrote thus in his behalf unto Sir <hi>Henry Wott<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

By which his old acquaintance may ſee
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:115803:53"/>
how tender this poor man was to be <hi>touched</hi> in any thing that might in the leaſt meaſure <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parago</hi> him. O what pains this poor man took to make himſelf a Subject for preſent and after diſcourſe! being troubled at nothing for the preſent, unleſs with the fear of not living to reap that fruit he was ſo ambitious of in all his undertakings. And certainly he was ſurprized with ſome ſuch <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>fears</hi> (for ſo he told us afterwards) when upon a time he being at <hi>Mandoa</hi> with us, and there ſtanding in a room againſt a ſtone <hi>Pillar,</hi> where the Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour was, and my ſelf preſent with them, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſudden he fell into ſuch a <hi>ſwoon,</hi> that we had very much ado to recover him out of it; but at laſt, come to himſelf, he told us that ſome ſad <hi>thoughts</hi> had immediately before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented themſelves to his <hi>Fancy,</hi> which as he conceived put him into that <hi>diſtemper;</hi> like <hi>Fannius</hi> in <hi>Martial—Ne moriare mori,</hi> to prevent death by dying: For he told us that there were great Expectations in <hi>England</hi> of the large Accounts he ſhould give of his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels after his return home; and that he was now ſhortly to leave us, and he being at preſent not very well, if he ſhould dye in the way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Surat,</hi> whither he was now intended to go, (which place he had not as yet ſeen) he might be buried in Obſcurity, and none of his Friends ever know what became of him, he
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:115803:54"/>
travelling now, as he uſually did, alone. Upon which my <hi>Lord</hi> willed him to ſtay longer with us, but he thankfully refuſed that offer, and turned his face preſently after towards <hi>Surat,</hi> which was then about three hundred miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from us, and he lived to come ſafely thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but there being <hi>over-kindly</hi> uſed by ſome of the Engliſh who gave him <hi>Sack,</hi> which they had brought from <hi>England,</hi> he calling for it as ſoon as he firſt heard of it, and crying, <hi>Sack, Sack:</hi> Is there ſuch a thing as <hi>Sack!</hi> I pray give me ſome <hi>Sack:</hi> and drinking of it, though, I conceive, moderately (for he was a very tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate man) it increaſed his <hi>Flux</hi> which he had then upon him; and this cauſed him within a few daies after his very tedious and troubleſome Travels (for he went moſt on foot) at this place to come to his Journies end; for here he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took Death in the Month of <hi>December,</hi> 1617. and was buried (as a foreſaid) under a little <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument,</hi> like one of thoſe are uſually made in our <hi>Church-yards:</hi> On which he ſhould have been remembred by this or the like <hi>Epitaph,</hi> if it could have been there engraved upon his <hi>Tombe.</hi>

                  <p>Of the Soyl there, what it is, and what it produceth, &amp;c.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis moſt ſpacious and fertile Monarchy (called by the Inhabitants <hi>Indoſtan)</hi> ſo much abounds in all neceſſaries for the uſe and ſervice of man, to <hi>feed,</hi> and <hi>cloath,</hi> and <hi>enrich</hi> him, as that it is able to ſubſiſt and flouriſh of it ſelf, without the leaſt help from any Neighbour-Prince or Nation.</p>
               <p>Here I ſhall ſpeak firſt of that which Nature requires moſt, <hi>Food,</hi> which this Empire brings forth in abundance; as, ſingular good <hi>Wheat, Rice, Barley,</hi> with divers more kinds of good <hi>Grain</hi> to make Bread (the ſtaff of life) and all theſe ſorts of Corn in their kinds, very good and exceeding cheap. For their <hi>Wheat,</hi> it is more <hi>full</hi> and more <hi>white</hi> than ours, of which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants make ſuch pure, well-reliſhed Bread, that I may ſay of it, as one ſometimes ſpake of the Bread made in the <hi>Biſhoprick of Leige,</hi> it is <hi>Panis Pane melior,</hi> Bread better than Bread.</p>
               <p>The ordinary ſort of people eat Bread made of a coarſer Grain, but both <hi>toothſome,</hi> and <hi>whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,</hi> and <hi>hearty;</hi> they make it up in broad <hi>Cakes,</hi> thick like our <hi>Oaten-cakes;</hi> and then bake it upon ſmall round iron <hi>hearths,</hi> which
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:115803:62"/>
they carry with them when they journey from place to place, making uſe of them in their <hi>Tents.</hi> It ſhould ſeem to be an antient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome in the Eaſt, as may appear by that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of <hi>Sarah</hi> when ſhe entertained the Angels, who found her in her Tent; <hi>She took fine meal, and did knead it, and made Cakes thereof upon the hearth,</hi> Gen. 18. 6.</p>
               <p>To their Bread they have great abundance of all other good Proviſion, as of <hi>Butter</hi> (beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Cream into a ſubſtance like unto a thick Oyl, for in that hot <hi>Climate</hi> they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make it hard) which though ſoft, yet it is very ſweet and good. They have <hi>Cheeſe</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in plenty, by reaſon of their great number of <hi>Kine,</hi> and <hi>Sheep,</hi> and <hi>Goats.</hi> Beſides, they have a Beaſt very large, having a ſmooth thick skin without hair, called a <hi>Buffelo,</hi> which gives good milk; the fleſh of them is like <hi>Beef,</hi> but neither ſo toothſome nor wholſome. Theſe <hi>Buffeloes</hi> are much employed in carrying large skins of water (for they are very ſtrong Beaſts) which hang on both ſides of them, unto Families that want it: their <hi>Hides</hi> make the moſt firm and excellent <hi>Buff.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They have no want of <hi>Veniſon</hi> of divers kinds, as <hi>Red-Deer, Fallow-Deer, Elks</hi> (which are very large, and ſtrong, and fierce Creatures) <hi>Antilops, Kids, &amp;c.</hi> but their <hi>Deer</hi> are no where imparked, the whole Empire being (as
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:115803:63"/>
it were) a Forreſt for them; for a man can travel no way but he ſhall here and there ſee of them. But becauſe they are every mans Game that will make them ſo, they do not multiply to do them much hurt, either in their <hi>Corn,</hi> or other <hi>places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe, they have great ſtore of <hi>Hares,</hi> and they have plenty of <hi>Fowls wild</hi> and <hi>tame,</hi> as abundance of <hi>Hens, Geeſe, Ducks, Pigeons, Turtle-Doves, Partriches, Peacocks, Quails,</hi> and many other ſingular good <hi>Fowl.</hi> They have variety of <hi>Fiſh;</hi> all which, by reaſon of their Plenty. and becauſe many of the Natives eat no kind of Fleſh at all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor of any thing that hath or may have life, and thoſe that feed on ſuch things eat not freely of any of thoſe living Creatures they are all bought there at ſuch eaſy rates, as if they were not worth the valuing. They do not cut their Chickens when they be little to make Capons, and therefore they have no Creatures of that name, but men, their Eunuchs called there <hi>Cogees</hi> or Capons in their Language: ſo made, when they be very young, and then deprived of all that might after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke jealouſie; and therefore they are put to be attendants on their women, the great men of that Nation keeping many of them, a ſoft, tender people, <hi>tener Spado,</hi> as <hi>Juvenal</hi> cals one of them, that never come to have any <hi>Hair</hi> on their <hi>Faces.</hi>

But to return again to their Proviſions, the <hi>Beeves</hi> of that Countrey differ from ours, in that there are none of them very large; and thoſe they have, have each of them a great <hi>bunch</hi> of griſly fleſh which grows upon the meeting of their <hi>ſhoulders.</hi> The <hi>fleſh</hi> of their <hi>Beeves</hi> is much <hi>whiter</hi> than the fleſh of <hi>ours,</hi> and very ſweet, tender and good. Their <hi>Sheep</hi> differ from ours by their great fleſhy <hi>Bob-tails,</hi> which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from their bodies are very ponderous. Their <hi>Wool</hi> is generally <hi>coarſe,</hi> but their fleſh is not ſo.</p>
               <p>Now to ſeaſon all their good Proviſions, there is great ſtore of <hi>Salt;</hi> and to ſweeten all, abundance of <hi>Sugar</hi> growing in that Countrey; which, after it is well refined, may be there had at a very low rate; out of which they make very pure white <hi>Sugar-Candy,</hi> which may be had there at a ſmall eaſy Price likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Their Fruits are every way anſwerable to the reſt, the Countrey abounding in <hi>Musk-Melons</hi> (very much better, becauſe they are better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted there by the heat of the Sun, than theſe with us) They have many <hi>Water-Melons,</hi> a very choyce good Fruit, and ſome of them as big as our ordinary <hi>Pompions,</hi> and in ſhape like them; the ſubſtance within this Fruit is ſpongie, but exceeding tender and well taſted, of a colour within equally mixed with <hi>red</hi> &amp; <hi>white,</hi>

and within that an excellent <hi>cooling</hi> and <hi>pleaſing liquor.</hi> Here are likewiſe ſtore of <hi>Pome-granats, Pome-citrons;</hi> here are <hi>Limons</hi> and <hi>Oranges,</hi> but I never found any there ſo good as I have ſeen elſwhere. Here are <hi>Dates, Figs, Grapes, Prunelloes, Almonds, Coquernuts</hi> (of which I obſerved ſomething before) and here they have thoſe moſt excellent <hi>Plums</hi> called <hi>Mirabolans,</hi> the ſtone of which Fruit differs very much from others in its ſhape, whereon Nature hath cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly quartered ſeveral ſtrakes equally divided, very pretty to behold; many of which choyce <hi>Plums</hi> (they write) are very cordial, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore worth the prizing, are there well preſerved, and ſent for <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They have to theſe another Fruit we Engliſh there call a <hi>Planten,</hi> of which many of them grow in <hi>Cluſters</hi> together; long they are in ſhape, made like unto ſlender <hi>Cucumbers,</hi> and very yellow when they are Ripe, and then taſt like unto a <hi>Norwich Pear,</hi> but much better. Another moſt excellent Fruit they have, called a <hi>Manggo,</hi> growing upon Trees as big as our <hi>Walnut-trees;</hi> and as theſe here, ſo thoſe Trees there, will be very full of that moſt excellent Fruit, in ſhape and colour like unto our <hi>Apri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks,</hi> but much bigger; which taken and rolled in a mans hands when they are through ripe, the ſubſtance within them becomes like the <hi>pap</hi> of a <hi>roaſted Apple,</hi> which then ſuck'd
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115803:64"/>
out from about a large ſtone they have within them, is delicately pleaſing unto every <hi>Palate</hi> that taſts it. And to conclude with the beſt of all other their choyce Fruits, the <hi>An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>anas,</hi> like unto our <hi>Pine-Apples,</hi> which ſeems to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to be a moſt pleaſing Compound made of <hi>Strawberies, Claret-wine, Roſe-water</hi> and <hi>Sugar</hi> well tempered together. In the Northernmoſt parts of this Empire they have variety of <hi>Pears</hi> and <hi>Apples,</hi> every where good <hi>Roots,</hi> as <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets, Potatoes,</hi> and others like them. They have <hi>Onions</hi> and <hi>Garlick,</hi> and ſome <hi>Herbs</hi> and ſmall <hi>Roots</hi> for <hi>Salads;</hi> and in the Southern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt parts, <hi>Ginger</hi> growing almoſt in every place: the large Races whereof are there very excellently well preſerved, as we may know by our taſting them in <hi>England.</hi> And all theſe things I have laſt named may be there likewiſe bought at very low rates And laſtly, ſome one kind or other of their very good and choyce Fruits may be there had at every time or ſeaſon of the Year.</p>
               <p>And here I cannot chuſe but take notice of a very pleaſant and clear liquor, called <hi>Toddie</hi> iſſuing from a Spongie Tree, that grows ſtrait and tall without Bowes to the top, and there ſpreads out in tender branches, very like unto thoſe that grow from the Roots of our rank and rich <hi>Artichokes,</hi> but much bigger and longer. This <hi>Toddie-tree</hi> is not ſo big, but that it may
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:115803:65"/>
be very eaſily embraced, and the nimble people of that Countrey will climb up as faſt to the top thereof (the ſtem of the Tree being rough and cruſty) as if they had the advantage of Ladders to help them up. In the top tender branches of thoſe Trees they make inciſions, which they open and ſtop again as they pleaſe, under which they hang Pots made of large and light <hi>Gourds,</hi> to preſerve the influence which iſſues out of them in a large quantity in the night ſeaſon, they ſtopping up thoſe vents in the heat of the day. That which thus diſtils forth in the night, if it be taken very early in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, is as pleaſing to the taſt as any new <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine,</hi> and much clearer than it. It is a very piercing, and medicinable, and moffenſive drink, if taken betimes in the day, onely it is a little windy: but if it be kept till the heat of the day, the Sun alters it ſo, as if it made it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kind of liquor, for it becomes then very heady, not ſo well reliſhed, and unwholſome; and when it is ſo not a few of our drunken <hi>Sea-men</hi> chuſe to drink it; and I think they ſo do, becauſe it will then preſently turn their brains; for there are too too many of the common ſort of thoſe men who uſe the Sea, who love thoſe brutiſh diſtempers too much, which turn a man out of himſelf, and leave a Beaſt in the skin of a man. But for that drink, if it be taken in its beſt, and moſt proper ſeaſon, I conceive it to be
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:115803:65"/>
of it ſelf very wholſome, becauſe it provokes urine exceedingly; the further benefit whereof ſome there have found by happy experience, thereby eaſed from their torture inflicted, by that ſhame of Phyſicians, and Tyran of all Maladies, the <hi>Stone.</hi> And ſo cheap too is this moſt pleaſing Wine, that a man may there have more than enough for a very little money.</p>
               <p>At <hi>Surat,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Agra,</hi> and beyond, it ſeldome or never <hi>rains,</hi> but one ſeaſon of the year; but yet there is a refreſhing <hi>Dew</hi> during all that time <hi>the Heavens there are thus ſhut up,</hi> which every night fals, and <hi>cools,</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts,</hi> and <hi>refreſheth</hi> the face of the <hi>earth.</hi> Thoſe general <hi>Rains</hi> begin near the time that the Sun comes to the Northern <hi>Tropick,</hi> and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue till his return back to the <hi>Line.</hi> Theſe ſhowers at their beginning moſt extremely vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are uſher'd in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and uſually take their leave with moſt fearful Tempeſts of <hi>Thunder. Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> more terrible than I can expreſs, yet ſeldome do harm; the reaſon in Nature may be, the ſubtilty of the <hi>Air</hi> in thoſe parts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there are fewer <hi>Thunder-ſtones</hi> made, than in ſuch <hi>Climates</hi> where the Air is <hi>thick, groſs,</hi> and <hi>cloudy.</hi> During thoſe three months it rains uſually every day more or leſs, ſometimes one whole quarter of the <hi>Moon</hi> together, ſcarce without any intermiſſion; which abundance of moyſture, with the heat of the Sun, doth ſo
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:115803:66"/>
enrich their Land, which they never force (if I obſerved right) by Soyling of it, as that, like <hi>Egypt,</hi> by the inundation of <hi>Nilus,</hi> it makes it fruitful all the year after. When the time of this <hi>Rain</hi> is paſſed over, the face of the Skye there is preſently ſo ſerene and clear, as that ſcarcely one <hi>Cloud</hi> appears in their <hi>Hemiſphere</hi> the nine months after.</p>
               <p>And here a ſtrong Argument that may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and moſt infallibly ſhew the goodneſs of their Soyl, ſhall not eſcape my Pen, moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in this, That when the Ground there hath been deſtitute of Rain nine months to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and looks all of it like the barren Sands in the Deſerts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> where there is not one ſpire of green Graſs to be found, within a few daies after thoſe fat enriching ſhowers begin to fall, the face of the Earth there (as it were by a new <hi>Reſurrection)</hi> is ſo revived, and through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſo renewed, as that it is preſently covered all over with a pure <hi>green Mantle.</hi> And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, to confirm that which before I obſerved concerning the goodneſs of that Soyl, amongſt many hundred Acres of <hi>Corn</hi> of divers kinds I have there beheld, I never ſaw any but what was very <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> ſtanding as thick on the Ground as the Land could well bear it.</p>
               <p>They till their Ground with Oxen and Foot-Ploughs, their Seed-time in <hi>May,</hi> and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>June,</hi> they taking their time to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:115803:66"/>
all that work before that long Rainy ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon comes; and though the Ground then hath been all the time we named before without any ſufficient moyſture by ſhowers, or otherwiſe, to ſupple and make it more fit for tilliage, yet the Soyl there is ſuch a brittle fat mould (which they ſow year after year) as that they can very eaſily till it. Their Harveſt is in <hi>November</hi> and <hi>December,</hi> the moſt temperate months of all that year.</p>
               <p>Their Ground is not encloſed, unleſs ſome ſmall quanty near <hi>Towns</hi> and <hi>Villages,</hi> which ſtand ſcattered up and down this vaſt Empire very thick, though, for want of the true names, not inſerted in the Map.</p>
               <p>They mow not their Graſs (as we) to make Hay, but cut it off the ground, either green, or withered, as they have occaſion to uſe it.</p>
               <p>They ſow <hi>Tobacco</hi> in abundance, and they take it too very much, but after a ſtrange way much different from us; for firſt, they have little Earthen Pots, ſhaped like our ſmall <hi>Flower-pots,</hi> having a narrow neck, and an open round top, out of the belly of which comes a ſmall ſpout, to the lower part of which ſpout they fill the Pot with water, then putting their <hi>Tobacco</hi> looſe in the top, and a burning coal upon it, they having firſt faſtned a very ſmall ſtrait hollow <hi>Cane</hi> or <hi>Reed</hi> (not bigger than a ſmall Arrow) within that ſpout, a yard or ell
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:115803:67"/>
long, the Pot ſtanding on the ground, draw that ſmoak into their mouths, which firſt falls upon the Superficies of the water, and much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colours it. And this way of taking their <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,</hi> they believe, makes it much more cool and wholſome. The <hi>Tobacco</hi> which grows there is doubtleſs in the Plant as good as in any other place of the world, but they know not how to cure and order it, like thoſe in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> to make it ſo rich and ſtrong.</p>
               <p>The Countrey is beautified with many <hi>Woods</hi> and <hi>Groves</hi> of Trees, in which thoſe winged <hi>Choriſters</hi> make ſweet Muſick. In thoſe Woods ſome excellent <hi>Hawks</hi> make their neſts, and there are very often to be ſeen great flocks of <hi>Parakeetoes,</hi> or little <hi>Parrats,</hi> who have their breeding and lodging amongſt thoſe Melancholy Shades. And (in the number of many other Creatures covered with Feathers) there are ſome very little Birds leſs than our <hi>Wrens,</hi> who are exceeding pretty, for their neat ſhape, and their covering, with moſt curious parti-colour'd Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, full of variety of little ſpots. I have ſeen there many of thoſe rare Creatures kept to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in large Cages, who pleaſe the <hi>Eye</hi> with their curious <hi>Colours,</hi> and the <hi>Ear</hi> with their variety of pleaſant <hi>Notes.</hi> The <hi>Woods</hi> and <hi>Groves</hi> in the Southernmoſt parts of <hi>Indoſtan,</hi> have great ſtore of wild <hi>Apes,</hi> and <hi>Monkeys,</hi> and <hi>Baboons</hi> in them, ſome of which I have ſeen
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:115803:67"/>
as high as our talleſt <hi>Greyhounds,</hi> which live among the Trees, and climbe them at pleaſure. Thoſe <hi>Apes, &amp;c.</hi> are very terrible to thoſe little Birds, which make their Neſts in thoſe Woods; and therefore Nature hath taught them this ſubtilty (to preſerve their young ones from thoſe Creatures which would otherwiſe deſtroy them) to build their Neſts in the twigs, and the utmoſt boughs of thoſe Trees, where ſome of them hang like little Purſe-nets, to which thoſe <hi>Apes</hi> and <hi>Monkeys,</hi> be they never ſo little and light, cannot come to hurt them.</p>
               <p>Beſides their Woods, they have great variety of fair goodly Trees that ſtand here and there ſingle, but I never ſaw any there of thoſe kinds of Trees which <hi>England</hi> affords. They have very many firm and ſtrong Timber-trees for building, and other uſes; but much of their bruſh, or ſmall wood, I obſerved to be very <hi>ſappie,</hi> ſo that when we brake a twig of it, there would come a ſubſtance out of ſome of it, like unto <hi>Milk,</hi> and the ſappineſs of that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood may (as I apprehend it) be aſcribed in part to the fatneſs of that Soyl. Some of their Trees have Leaves upon them broad as <hi>Bucklers,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are parted ſmall like out <hi>Fern</hi> or <hi>Brakes,</hi> as the <hi>Tamerine</hi> Tree, which bears <hi>Gods</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like our <hi>Beans,</hi> in which when the Fruit is ripe, there is a very well taſted <hi>pulp,</hi> though it
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115803:68"/>
be ſowr, moſt wholſome to open the body, and to cool and cleanſe the blood.</p>
               <p>There is one very great and fair Tree grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that Soyl, of ſpecial obſervation, out of whoſe <hi>Branches</hi> or great <hi>Arms</hi> grow little <hi>Sprigs</hi> downward till they take <hi>Root</hi> (as they will certainly do if they be let alone) and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Root, at length prove ſtrong ſupporters unto thoſe large Branches that yield them. Whence it comes to paſs, that thoſe Trees in time (their ſtrong and far-extended Arms being in many places thus ſupported) grow to a very great height, and extend themſelves to ſuch an incredible breadth, they growing round every way, as that hundreds of men may ſhade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under one of them at any time; the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe theſe, as all other Trees in thoſe Southern parts of <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> (as particularly I obſerved before) ſtill keep on their <hi>green Coats.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For their <hi>Flowers,</hi> they are for the generality like unto painted <hi>Weeds,</hi> which, though their colour be excellent, they rather delight the <hi>eye</hi> than affect the <hi>ſmell;</hi> for not many of them, except <hi>Roſes,</hi> and ſome few kinds more; are any whit fragrant: Amongſt them that are, there is one white <hi>Flower,</hi> like to Spaniſh <hi>Jeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamin</hi> (if it be not the ſame) which is exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well ſented, of which they make a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:115803:68"/>
pure ſweet <hi>Oyl,</hi> with which they anoynt their <hi>heads,</hi> and other parts of their bodies; which makes the company of thoſe that do ſo very <hi>ſavoury</hi> and <hi>ſweet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Empire is watered with many goodly Rivers (as they are expreſſed in the Map) the two principal are <hi>Indus</hi> and <hi>Ganges;</hi> where this thing is very obſervable (for they ſay there that it is very true) that one pint of the water of <hi>Ganges</hi> weigheth leſs by <hi>one ounce</hi> than any other water in that whole great <hi>Monarchy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> And therefore (they ſay) that the <hi>Mogol,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he is, hath water brought him from that <hi>River,</hi> that he may drink thereof, by ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that ſervice, who are continually either going to it, or coming from it: The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is brought unto the <hi>King</hi> in fine <hi>Copper Jars,</hi> excellently well tin'd on the inſide, and ſealed up when they are delivered to the Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers for the <hi>King</hi>'s uſe; two of which <hi>Jars</hi> every one carries, hanging upon Slings fitted for the Porter's ſhoulders.</p>
               <p>Beſides their Rivers, they have ſtore of <hi>Wels</hi> fed with Springs; and to theſe, they have many <hi>Ponds,</hi> which they call <hi>Tanques,</hi> ſome of them exceeding large, fill'd with water when that abundance of Rain fals (of which more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.)</p>
               <p>That moſt antient and innocent Drink of the World, <hi>Water,</hi> is the common drink of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115803:69"/>
                  <hi>Eaſt-India;</hi> it is far more pleaſant and ſweet than our water; and muſt needs be ſo, becauſe in all hot Countries it is more rarified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> better digeſted, and freed from its rawne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s by the heat of the <hi>Sun,</hi> and therefore in thoſe parts it is more deſired of all that come thither, though they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made it their drink before, than any other liquor and agreeth better with mens bodies. Sometimes we boyl the water there with ſome wholſome ſeeds and after drink it <hi>cold,</hi> and then it is by much more cold after an <hi>heat.</hi> (Like unto ſome <hi>men,</hi> who have ſhewed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly much <hi>zeal</hi> and heat for good, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward become more <hi>chill</hi> and <hi>cold</hi> than ever they were before) Sometimes we mingle our water there with the <hi>juice</hi> of <hi>Limons</hi> and <hi>Sugar,</hi> which makes an exceeding pleaſant drink, which we call there <hi>Sherbet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some ſmall quantity of <hi>Wine,</hi> but not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, is made amongſt them; they call it <hi>Ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Many of the people there, who are ſtrict in their Religion, drink no Wine at all; but they uſe a Liquor more wholſome than pleaſant, they call <hi>Coffee,</hi> made by a black ſeed boyled in water, which turns it almoſt into the ſame colour, but doth very little alter the taſt of the water; notwithſtanding it is very good to

               </p>
               <p>There is yet another help for thoſe that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear Wine, by an Herb they have, called <hi>Beetle,</hi> or <hi>Paune,</hi> in ſhape ſomewhat like an Ivy-leaf, but more tender; they chew it with an hard <hi>Nut,</hi> ſomewhat like a <hi>Nutmeg</hi> (but not in taſt like that) and a very little pure <hi>white-lime</hi> amongſt the leaves, and when they have ſucked down the juice, put forth the reſt. It hath (as they ſay and I believe very much of it) many rare qualities, for it preſerves the <hi>Teeth,</hi> ſtrengthens the <hi>Stomack,</hi> comforts the <hi>Brain,</hi> and it cures or prevents a tainted <hi>Breath.</hi> This I am ſure of that ſuch is the pleaſing ſmell of this <hi>Beetle,</hi> being chewed in a cloſe <hi>room,</hi> that the breath of him ſo chewing it fils it with a very pleaſing <hi>ſavour.</hi>

               <p>The hair upon their Horſes (whom they keep plump and fat) is very ſhort, ſoft, and lyes ſleek upon them, and I wonder not at it, they are kept ſo daintily, every Horſe being allowed a man to dreſs and feed him, and to run by him when he is rode forth, and this is all his work.</p>
               <p>They tye not down their horſe heads when they ſtand ſtill (as we do) with hal ets, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure each horſe by two ropes, faſtned to their hinde feet, which ropes are ſomwhat long to be ſtaked down behind them in tents, or other places wherein they are kept.</p>
               <p>They cut graſs for them green or withered on the earth as they have occaſion to uſe it, never mowing their ground and making hay as we do.

               <p>Their choyſe good horſes are valued there at as dear if not an higher rate, than thoſe we eſteem moſt of in <hi>England</hi> are prized with us. They make excellent Sadles, and ſome of them of great value adorned with handſome and rich trapings, all of them very eaſy both for the horſe, and his rider.

               <p>The <hi>Elephants</hi> in this vaſt Monarchy are very numerous, and though they be the largeſt, and that by far, of all the Creatures the earth brings forth, yet are they ſo tractable, unleſs at ſome times when the Males are mad (of which more afterward) as that a boy of twelve years old is able to rule the biggeſt of them, in which we may in a ſpeciall manner read a Comment on that truth which tells us how that the Lord hath put <hi>the fear of man upon all the creatures here below;</hi> even upon the greateſt of them, as well as the leaſt. <hi>Thou makeſt him</hi> ſaith David Pſal. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6, 7. <hi>to have domixion over the works of thy hands; thou haſt put all things under his feet; all ſheep and Oxen, yea and the beaſts of the field, &amp;c.</hi> Now if Almighty God ſhould let looſe the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures upon man, if he ſhould let go thoſe reigns by which they reſtrained, and ſuffer the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

               <p>Some that write of them have abuſed the world with this tradition that they have no joints in their leggs, and therefore ſtand when they ſleep againſt trees to hold them up, which is all very falſe, for they ly down and ariſe again at their pleaſure as other beaſts do.</p>
               <p>Their motion is not ſwift, a walking rather than a pace, about three miles at the moſt an hour, but of all heaſts that carry burdens, they are moſt ſure of foot, for they never fall, nor yet ſtumble to endanger their Rider.</p>

                  <hi>Lipſius</hi> in his Epiſtles Cent. 1. Epiſt. 50. out of his obſervation from others, writes more of them than I can confirm, or any, I perſwade my ſelf, believe; yet many things moſt remarkable, which ſeem indeed to be acts of reaſon rather than ſenſe, I have obſerved in them, for inſtance, an <hi>Elephant</hi> will doe any thing his keeper Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him, as if he bid him to affright a man, he will make towards him as if he meant to tread him into peeces, but when he is come at him do him no hurt at all; ſo if he would have him, to abuſe or to diſgrace a man, he will take dirt or duſt, or kennel-water into his Trunk, and daſh it on his face.</p>
               <p>Their Trunks are griſly ſnouts of a great length, hanging down betwixt their long teeth, which teeth nature hath given them for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, otherwiſe they are of little uſe to them. In their Trunks they have ſuch marvellous ſtrength, that by them they can do very much miſchief, for if they ſtrike an Horſe, or Camel, or any other the like beaſt with them, (as ſometimes they do when as they are mad) they will ſo break their bones, as that they will ſpoyl, nay kill them at one blow, and much more a man if he chance to come in their way.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Trunks of the <hi>Elephants</hi> are to them as an hand by which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115803:88"/>
from trees, by winding them about them, and after, with them, put boughs into their mouths, and eat the tendereſt parts of them. With theſe they pull up green corn (if they be ſuffered) and graſs by the roots, and then againſt their leggs beat off the earth and duſt that hangs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, before they eat thereof. Thus they deal with ſedgs, or weeds which they find in the water, firſt waſhing off the dirt which hangs on the roots thereof, and then down they go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their vaſt bellyes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Elephants</hi> delight much to bathe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in water, in which, when they find depth enough, they ſwim as well as any other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>I obſerved before, that the male <hi>Elephants</hi> when they grow luſty are ſometimes mad for their <hi>Femals,</hi> but in few dayes come again in temper; before which time they are ſo miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, that they will ſtrike any thing, but their Keepers, that comes in their way; and their ſtrength is ſuch (as before I obſerv'd) that there is no blow they give which lights either upon men or beaſt, but carryes death with it. At thoſe times to prevent miſchief they are kept apart from Company, fetterd with ſtrong chaines unto trees; but if by chance in their phrenſie they get looſe (as ſometimes they do) they will make after every thing they ſee ſtir, in which caſe they have no means to ſtop them
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115803:89"/>
in their violent courſe, but by firing of <hi>Crackers</hi> made of Gunpowder, whoſe ſparkling, and noyſe makes them to ſtand ſtill and tremble. When thoſe creatures are in that mad diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, they ſweat much, which makes their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour exceeding rank and filthy like that ill ſmel of a Boa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>An <hi>Engliſh Merchant</hi> there, of good credit upon his own knowledge, reported this thing which followes, and is very obſervable, of an <hi>Elephant</hi> in <hi>Adſmeer,</hi> (the place then of the <hi>Mogols</hi> reſidence) who being brought often through the <hi>Bazar</hi> or Market place, a woman who uſually ſat there to ſell herbs, was wont to give this great <hi>Elephant</hi> an handfull, as he many times paſſed by; this <hi>Elephant</hi> after, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mad, brake his fetters, and took his way through that <hi>Bazar;</hi> the people being all of them much affrighted, made haſt to ſecure themſelves by getting out of his way, amongſt whom was this herb-woman, who, for fear and haſt, forgot her little Child which ſhe had brought thither; the <hi>Elephant</hi> came to the place where this woman uſually ſate, ſtopt, and ſeeing a little Child lying there about her herbs, took it up gently with his <hi>Trunk,</hi> not doing it the leaſt harm, and preſently after layd it down upon the ſtall of an houſe that was hard by;
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115803:89"/>
and then proceeded on in his furious courſe. <hi>Acoſta,</hi> a Jeſuit, relates the like of an <hi>Elephant</hi> in <hi>Goa</hi> from his own experience.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Elephant,</hi> though he be vaſt, and terrible, yea and cruell too, when he is ſet to do miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, or when he is mad, yet otherwiſe is a tame gentle Creature, ſo that the dread of this huge beaſt, moſt appears to the eyes. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his terribleneſs, I once there ſaw a <hi>Creature</hi> compared with an <hi>Elephant,</hi> not much bigger than a ſmall <hi>Fiſh</hi> compared with a <hi>Whale,</hi> boldly to encounter one of them. The occaſion by which this ſo came to paſs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it ſelf thus; that year I went for <hi>Eaſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> the Merchants here (as from the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in whoſe name they ſent all their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents) amongſt many other things, then ſent the <hi>Mogol</hi> ſome great Engliſh <hi>Maſtives,</hi> and ſome large Iriſh <hi>Greyhounds,</hi> in all to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of eight, diſperſed in our ſeverall ſhips; one of thoſe high ſpirited Maſtives in our voyage thither, upon a day ſeeing a great <hi>Shoale</hi> or company of <hi>Porpiſces</hi> (before deſcribed) moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up above the waves, and coming toward that ſhip wherein he was, ſuddenly lept over-board to encounter with them, before any did take notice of that fierce creature, to prevent that engagement, wherein he was irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly loſt, the ſhip then having ſuch a freſh gale of winde, that ſhe could not ſuddenly ſlack her
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115803:90"/>
courſe, whereby that poor creature might have been preſerved. Another, one of the Iriſh <hi>Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds</hi> had his head ſhot off in our fight. The <hi>Mange</hi> was the deſtruction of four more of them, only two of the Maſtives came alive to <hi>Eaſt-India,</hi> and they were carried up, each of them drawn in a little Coach, when I went up to the Embaſſador, that he might preſent them to the <hi>Mogol.</hi> The fierceſt of theſe two, in our way thither, upon a time breaking looſe, fell upon a very large <hi>Elephant</hi> that was hard by us, faſtning his teeth in the <hi>Elephants</hi> Trunk, and kept his hold there a good while, which made that huge beaſt extremely to roare; and though the <hi>Elephant</hi> did ſwing the Maſtive up and down above ground many times (as not fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his weight) that he might throw him off; yet he could not ſuddenly do it, but at laſt free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf from the dog by throwing him a good ſpace from him, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This ſtorie pleaſed the <hi>Mogol</hi> very much when the dogs were preſented to him, and he allowed each of them four attendants of thoſe
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115803:90"/>
Natives to wait upon them, who by turnes two and two together carried them up and down with him in <hi>Palankees,</hi> (after deſcribed) to which they were tyed, and the other two went by them, fanning the flyes from off them; and the King cauſed a pair of ſilver <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The <hi>Mogol</hi> hath many of his great <hi>Elephants</hi> train'd up for the war, who carry each of them one iron <hi>gun,</hi> about five foot long, lying upon a ſtrong <hi>frame of wood,</hi> made ſquare that is fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a thick broad Pannel faſtned about him; with very ſtrong and broad Girſes or Girts. The <hi>gun</hi> like an <hi>Harquebuſh</hi> hath a peece of iron like a Musket-reſt faſtned on the ſides thereof, made looſe to play up and down. The bottome of that Iron Reſt ſo fixed, is long, to be let through that frame of wood on the foreſide, and ſo to be keyed in at the bottom. At the four corners of this frame are ſmall flags of ſilk, with ſundry devices painted on them, put upon little neat coloured ſtaves; upon the neck of the <hi>Elephant</hi> ſits a man to guide him, and within the frame a <hi>Gunner,</hi> to make his ſhot as he finds occaſion. The peece thus mounted, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rves a bullet about the bigneſs of a <hi>Tennis Ball.</hi>

               <p>The <hi>Elephants</hi> are all governed with a ſmall <hi>rod</hi> of ſteel about half a yard long, made ſharp on the lower end, and towards that end there is an hook returned, life a fiſh-hook, that is very ſharp likewiſe, by which their Riders ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on their necks, pull them back, or prick them forward at their pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Theſe vaſt Creatures, though the Countrey be exceeding fruitfull, and all proviſions in it cheap, yet by reaſon of their huge bulk, if they be well kept and fed, are very chargeable in keeping; they are kept uſually under the ſhade of great trees, where by a ſtrong chain of iron upon one of their hinde leggs they faſten them. And as they ſtand, the abundance of flyes vex them, and therefore with their fore-feet they make duſt, (the ground uſually being very dry) and with their Trunks caſt the duſt about their bodyes to drive away thoſe flyes from them.</p>
               <p>The King allowes every one of thoſe great male <hi>Elephants</hi> four femals, which in their
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:115803:91"/>
language they call their wives. Theſe brutes (as they ſay) will not endure any to behold them when they are coupling together; which may condemn many who call themſelves men and women, but have ſo loſt all modeſty, that <hi>they are not aſhamed when they commit any act of filthineſs, no they are not aſhamed, neither can they bluſh.</hi> The Female <hi>Elephants</hi> (as they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay) carry their young, one whole year ere they bring them forth, Thirty years expire ere they come to their full growth, and they fulfill the accuſtomed age of men ere they dye. And laſtly, notwithſtanding the great Number there of thoſe vaſt Creatures, and the exceſſive charge in keeping them well, they value them at ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding high rates.</p>
               <p>For this people, when as they journey from place to place, the men of the inferiour ſort go all on foot, their women that cannot ſo tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, ride on little Oxen, inured to carry bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, or on Aſſes, which carry their little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with them; the women like the men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtride.

The weapons they uſe in their Wars are Bowes, and Arrowes, Swords, and Bucklers, ſhort Lances, having excellent good ſteel-heads, &amp; ſhort peeces like unto <hi>Carbines,</hi> beſides thoſe carried upon <hi>Elephants</hi> (before deſcribed) ſome footmen in their warrs carry thoſe leſſer Guns, with Bowes and Arrowes, Swords and Bucklers, and they are excellent Marks-men. They make good Gun-powder for their own uſe, and fire their Guns with March, or Touch-wood. Their ſwords are made crooked like Falchons, and are very ſharp, but for want of skill in thoſe that temper them, will eaſily break, but not bend. And therefore we ſell at good rates our Engliſh Sword-blades that will bow, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſtrait again.

               <p>Their warlike muſick are ſome Kettle-drums carried on horſe-back, with long winde Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which make not Muſick, but noyſe ſo harſh, and unpleaſing, that it is enough to fright away their enemies.</p>

There are ſome of the <hi>Mogols</hi> own ſubjects which are men of courage; thoſe of note among the <hi>Mahometans</hi> are called <hi>Baloches,</hi> inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Haiacan,</hi> adjoyning unto the Kingdom of <hi>Perſia,</hi> (ſpoken of before) and there are others called <hi>Patans,</hi> taking their denomination from a Province of that name in the Kingdom of <hi>Bengala.</hi> Theſe will look an enemy boldly in the face, and maintain with their lives, their reputation and valour. Amongſt the many Sects of <hi>Hindooes</hi> or Gentiles (after ſpoken of) which are ſubject to this King, there is but one race of fighters called <hi>Raſhboots,</hi> a number of which live by ſpoyl, who in troops ſurprize poor paſſengers, for the moſt part murthering thoſe whom they get under their power. Theſe excepted, the reſt of the <hi>Mogols,</hi> natives for the generality of them had rather <hi>eate</hi> than <hi>quarrel,</hi> and rather quarrel than fight. I ſay quarrel, for I have ſeveral times obſerved there, that when two of them, have been both well armed, and have moſt ſhamefully abuſed one another, in baſer language than I can expreſs, yet durſt not draw their weapons; in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, when one of them hath caught the other by the throat, and forced him up againſt ſome wall, the ſufferer would cry out pitiouſly, and the ſtanders by would admire the other for his valous, ſaying <hi>Sha-Abas;</hi> a proverbial ſpeech amongſt them relating to the late King of <hi>Perſia,</hi>

called <hi>Sha-Abas,</hi> a Prince much renowned for valour; and when any man did a thing they thought gallantly, they cryed <hi>Sha-Abas,</hi> as much to ſay, it was done as well as the <hi>Perſian</hi> King could have done it.</p>
               <p>Yet, however the people here in general are Cowardly they appear men of very terrible aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, having great long <hi>Muſtachos</hi> upon their upper lipps, their Chins continually kept bare by the raſor, which makes them all to look like the Pictures of our old <hi>Britaines;</hi> or like thoſe our rude Painters daub upon clothes, and call them the <hi>Nine-worthies.</hi> And further, to make them the more formidable, they will appear on horſe-back as if they were ſurrounded with an <hi>Armorie,</hi> or carrying an whole <hi>Armorie</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, thus appointed; At their left ſides <hi>ſwords</hi> hanging on belts, under them ſheaves of many <hi>arrowes;</hi> on their left ſhoulders broad <hi>Bucklers</hi> faſtned, and upon their backs ſmal <hi>Gunns</hi> like to Carbines fixed likewiſe; at their right ſides <hi>Bowes</hi> hanging in caſes, and <hi>Lances</hi> (about two yards and an half long) hanging in loops neer their ſtirrops (when they carry them not in their hands) yet for all this <hi>Harneſs</hi> the moſt of them are like thoſe <hi>Ephramites,</hi> Pſal. 78. 9. <hi>Who being armed, and carrying bowes, turned their heads in the day of battell.</hi> For they dare not look a man of courage in the face, though they be thus <hi>fortified,</hi> with ſuch

               <p>The baſe Cowardiſe of which people, hath made the great <hi>Mogol</hi> ſometimes to uſe this Proverb, that one <hi>Portugal</hi> would beat three of his people; and (becauſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there have many times prevailed much at Sea againſt thoſe <hi>Portugals)</hi> he would further add, that one <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> would beat three <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth is, that the <hi>Portugals,</hi> eſpecially thoſe which are born in thoſe <hi>Indian</hi> Colonyes, moſt of them a mix'd ſeed begotten upon thoſe Natives, are a very low, poor-ſpirited people, called therefore <hi>Galijnas del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>One notable inſtance to prove this, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that the <hi>Eaſt India</hi> Company had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little <hi>Pinnace</hi> they called the <hi>Coaſter,</hi> which they kept in thoſe parts for diſcoveries; mann'd ſhe was but with ten men, and had only one ſmall <hi>murdering-peece</hi> within her.

               <p>However, upon this account there came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a time at my firſt coming into <hi>India,</hi> unto the factorie at <hi>Surat,</hi> where I then was, a moſt valiant <hi>Portugal</hi> (if you will give him leave to tell his own ſtorie, and believe it when he hath done) who firſt for his perſon was a <hi>Quantus tantus, tantillus,</hi> a very poor, little dwarfiſh man, whoſe perſon promiſed as little valour as any that I ever ſaw, though I know that high Courage is not tyed to an huge bulk, for (if ſtories abuſe us not) <hi>Alexander</hi> the great was But a <hi>little man;</hi> but what ever <hi>Alexander</hi> was, I am ſure, that this was a poor little thing, but however he told us, that he was by birth an <hi>Hidalgo,</hi> which ſignifies in Spaniſh <hi>the Son of ſomebody,</hi> or no ordinary man, but a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Spain,</hi> and that he came from thence as a Companion to the King of Spains <hi>Vice-Roy,</hi> ſent to <hi>Goa,</hi> and himſelf was called the <hi>Knight</hi> with the Golden <hi>Rapier,</hi> and that ſuddenly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his coming to <hi>Goa,</hi> he was honorably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited into the field, there to fight a ſingle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat with a very gallant man of that place, but he ſoon left him there dead; and having done ſo, the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> prevented him with a pardon for that fact, before he ask'd it, but willing him withall, now he had been ſufficiently tryed, to confine his <hi>Rapier</hi> to its ſcabard. But he told
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:115803:98"/>
us further, that he could not long after live quietly there, but was provoked again by a man of high reſolution, unto a ſecond encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when he had the like ſucceſs as before, in killing his Adverſary. The <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> now was very angry with him, but upon much intreaty, as he ſaid, pardoned him a ſecond time; upon the receit of which favour he told us that he was then reſolved to throw away his Rapier, to get into a Religious houſe, and there to remain the reſidue of his dayes, a <hi>Convertado</hi> or <hi>Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</hi> But the <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> could not be long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Company, and therefore to gain it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored him again into his former favour: But for himſelf he was ſtill ſo unhappie (the fame of his great valour being ſpread abroad) as that he could not long enjoy that Peace, and quiet, which he now ſo much deſired, but received a third Challenge from a very gallant, and very valiant man, as he deſcrib'd him, a man big enough to beat a <hi>Goliah,</hi> and then he further told us, that his honour was ever more dear unto him than his life, and therefore notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the loſs of the <hi>Vice-Royes</hi> favour, and what els might happen, he entred the liſts with him, and though he found him the ſtouteſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary that ever he oppoſed, yet after a long conflict this little Knight kild that great Giant, and left him there dead likewiſe, which done, He (not daring to return any more unto <hi>Goa)</hi>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:115803:98"/>
told us, that he came naked out of the field as we then ſaw him with no ornaments (I aſſure you) about him, fit to make him a <hi>Vice-Royes</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panion, nor any <hi>weapon</hi> fit to <hi>Dub</hi> him <hi>Knight</hi> of the Golden <hi>Rapier.</hi> He further added, that he was now reſolved not to live any longer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Chriſtians, but that he deſireth to live amongſt the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but when we replyed that we were Chriſtians, he cried <hi>Jeſu Maria!</hi> as wondring at it, and further told us that, he never heard ſo before.</p>
               <p>When this <hi>Rhadomantadiſt</hi> had ended his perillous ſtory, it was dinner time, and the Merchants bid him to ſit down with us and eat, and ſo he did, where certainly he layd about him more valiantly than ever he had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the field, giving our meat many a cut, and eating, as if he had been more than half ſtarved.

being weary of his ſtay with us (though he was but too well uſed) and having a great minde to ramble further, told our Company, that he being an <hi>Hidalgo,</hi> it was very diſhonorable for him to take entertainment upon the Tearmes he had it, and therefore deſired us to make a little Purſe for him, on which he would live as long as he could, and then <hi>Creep</hi> into ſome <hi>Deſert</hi> place, and there <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>dy.</hi> And now our great <hi>Gheſt,</hi> having ſpent all his <hi>humor,</hi> and told us all his <hi>Dream,</hi> had his deſire granted in ſome money that was given to him, and ſo we parted with our <hi>Knight Errant,</hi> who lived longer than he told us he would live, for half a year after I took notice of him at the <hi>Mogols</hi> Court, and there I leave him.</p>

               <p>But to return unto the place from whence I am now digreſſed. I travelled from <hi>Surat</hi> with four <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> more, and about twenty of the Natives in our Company, we beginning our journey the firſt of <hi>January</hi> towards <hi>Sir Thomas Row,</hi> at the <hi>Mogols</hi> Court, then above
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:115803:101"/>
four hundred miles diſtant from <hi>Surat.</hi> We had ſix wagons drawn with Oxen, in our Company, laden with rich Engliſh goods (the principal part whereof was Engliſh broad cloth) aſſign'd to an Engliſh Merchant at the Court, and ſome other Carriages we had, of all which we made a ring every night neer ſome large <hi>Town</hi> or <hi>Village,</hi> where we reſolved to ſtay, and pitched our Huts within that Circle, ſome of us watching, and the Natives with us, every night; we went on that long journey ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſafely, only in ſome places where there was any ſuſpicion of danger, we had a guard of horſe appointed to go with us for our defence, by the Command of <hi>Sultan Caroon</hi> the Prince, and now King, (who had his revenue out of thoſe parts we then travelled thorough) who ſent a Footman, that continually kept us company, with his letters to command a Company of Souldiers that were horſemen, to guard us where he thought good, who as they did not expect, ſo they would take no recompence for their paines, though we freely offered it them. But the providence of God did ſo order it, that though we had their company in ſeveral places, we never had need of their help for our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. The truth is, that the people there in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral are very civil, and we never had any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts or ill uſage from them, if we did not firſt provoke them.</p>

But if we did, they would not well bear it, for twice in one week at my firſt comming to <hi>Surat</hi> the whole town in general were in an uproar, and ſurrounded our houſe there, both times ſome of our Engliſh Provok'd thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to ſtir againſt us, but by our ſpeedy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes unto the Governour of that place, we excuſing the fault of thoſe that miniſtred the occaſion of their diſcontent, they being newly come thither, and altogether unacquainted with their cuſtomes, he preſently commanded that wild Aſſembly to depart from our houſe, and ſo immediatly they did, we receiving no hurt at all from any of them.</p>

The Cook had his head quickly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-freighted with it, and then ſtaggering home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in his way met the Governors Brother of <hi>Surat,</hi> as he was riding to his houſe, the Cook made a ſtand, ſtaying himſelf up upon his ſword &amp; ſcabbard, and cry'd out to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours Brother, <hi>Now thou Heathen dog.</hi> He not underſtanding his foul language, replyed civilly in his own <hi>Ca-ca-ta,</hi> which ſignifies, what ſayeſt thou? the Cook anſwered him with his ſword and ſcabbard, with which he ſtrook at at him, but vvas immediatly ſeiſed on by his follovvers, and by them diſarm'd and carried to Priſon; the Ambaſſadour had preſent intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the misbehaviour of his drunken ſervant, and immediatly ſent vvord unto the Governours Brother, that he vvas not come thither to patronize any diſorderly perſon, and therefore deſir'd him to do vvith him what he pleaſed, upon which he preſently ſent him home, not doing him the leaſt hurt. But before I leave this ſtorie, it will not be amiſs to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire who was the <hi>Heathen dog</hi> at this time, whether the debaucht drunken <hi>Cook</hi> who call'd

himſelf a Chriſtian, or that ſober and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Mahometan</hi> who was thus affronted.</p>
               <p>In our journey towards the <hi>Court</hi> (after we had been in our way about ſeven dayes from <hi>Surat)</hi> we reſted at a place called <hi>Ditat,</hi> where many of the Inhabitants offered to guard us and our goods, though we (obſerving there no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger) deſired it not, but they would do it, and in the morning expected and asked ſomething of us, by way of recompence. One of our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany (who had been in <hi>Eaſt India</hi> a year or two before) told them, that what they had done they did without ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> deſire, and therefore they ſhould have nothing from us, but ſome ill language which he then gave them. We ſet forward in the morning according to our wonted cuſtom they followed after us, to the number at the leaſt of three hundred men (for the place was great and populous) and when we were gone about a mile from that Town, ſtopped our carriages; he of our Company who told them they ſhould have no recompence, was preſently ready to ſhoot at them with his <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,</hi> which made them all to bend their Bowes at us, but I happily and ſuddenly ſtepping in, prevented his firing at them, and their ſhooting at us, which if I had not by Gods good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence done, but we had madly engaged ſuch a great multitude, there could not have been leſs expected in the ſad iſſue thereof, than the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:115803:103"/>
loſs of all our lives, and goods, but having a little Parlee with them, for the value of three ſhillings of Engliſh money given amongſt them, they were all quieted and contented, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly left us, wiſhing us a good journey.</p>
               <p>After this, when we had gone forward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twenty dayes journey (which daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooves were but ſhort, by reaſon of our heavy carriages, and the heat of the weather) it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that another of our Company, a young Gentleman about twenty years old, the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a Baron of <hi>England,</hi> behaved himſelf ſo ill, as that we feared it would have brought very much miſchief on us.</p>
               <p>This young man being very unruly at home, and ſo many others that have been well born, when their friends knew not what to do with them, have been ſent to <hi>Eaſt India,</hi> that ſo they might make their own <hi>Graves</hi> in the <hi>Sea,</hi> in their paſſage thither, or els have <hi>Graves</hi> made for them on the <hi>Indian</hi> ſhore, when they come there. A very cleanly conveyance (but how juſt and honeſt, I leave to others) for Parents to be rid of their unruly Children; but I never knew any who were thus ſuppoſed to be ſent thither, but they outlived that voyage.</p>
               <p>For the young Gentleman I ſpake of, his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment was to wait upon our chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in his Cabin, who very courteouſly when he came to Sea, turn'd him before the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115803:103"/>
                  <hi>maſt</hi> amongſt the common ſaylors [a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment for a man of his birth,] but for all this he outliv'd that harſh uſage, and came ſafely to <hi>Eaſt India,</hi> and my Lord Ambaſſadour hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of him, and being well acquainted with his great kindred, ſent for him up to the <hi>Court,</hi> and there entertain'd him as a Companion for a year, then giving him all fit accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſent him home again as a paſſenger for England, where after he ſafely arrived.</p>
               <p>But in our way towards that Court, it thus happened, that this <hi>hot-brains</hi> being a little behind us, commanded him [then neer him] who was the Princes ſervant [before ſpoken of] to hold his horſe, the man replyed, that he was none of his ſervant, and would not do it. Upon which this moſt intemperate mad youth, who was like <hi>Philocles</hi> that angry Poet; and therefore called <hi>Bilis, &amp; Salſigo,</hi> Choler and Brine, [for he was the moſt haſty and cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick young man that ever I knew] as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by his preſent carriage, which was thus; firſt he beat that ſtranger, for refuſing to hold his horſe, with his horſe-whip, which I muſt tell you, that people cannot endure, as if thoſe whips ſtung worſe than <hi>Scopions.</hi> For of any puniſhments that carry moſt diſgrace in them, as that people think one is to be beaten with that <hi>whip,</hi> where with all they ſtrike their beaſts; the other to be beaten [and this they eſteem the
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:115803:104"/>
more diſgracefull puniſhment of the two) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the head with ſhooes. But this ſtranger (being whipt as before) came up and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to me, but to make him amends, that <hi>frantick young man</hi> (mad with rage, and he knew not wherefore) preſently followed him, and being come up cloſe to him, diſcharg'd his <hi>Piſtol</hi> laden with a brace of <hi>bullets</hi> directly at his body, which bullets, by the ſpecial guidance of the hand of God, ſo flew, that they did the poor man no great hurt, only one of them firſt tearing his coat, bruſed all the knucles of his left hand and the other brake his bow which he carried in the ſame hand. We preſently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed our young <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dlam,</hi> till he might return again to his witts. But our greateſt buſineſs was how to pacifie the other man whom he had thus injured: I preſently gave him a <hi>Roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pee;</hi> in our money two ſhillings and nine pence; he thanked me for it, and would have taken it with his right, but I deſired him to take it with his maym'd hand, and ſo he did, and could clinch it very well, which I was glad of. Then we did ſhew (as we had cauſe) all the diſlike we could againſt that deſperat act of him, from whom he received his hurt, telling him, that we were all ſtrangers, and for our parts had done him no wrong at all, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hoped that we ſhould not be made any way to ſuffer for the faults of another, and we
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:115803:104"/>
further told him, that if he would be quiet till we came up to the <hi>Con<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t,</hi> he ſhould have all the ſatisfaction he could deſire. He told us, that we were good men, and had done him no wrong, and that he would til then reſt contented; but he did not ſo, for about two houres after we met with a great man of that Countrey, having a mighty train with him, (as al the <hi>Grandees</hi> there have when they travel (of whom more after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) He preſently went towards him, that to him he might make his complaint; and ſo did, telling him, that he was the <hi>Princes</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, why he came to us, and how he had been uſed by us, ſhewing him his hand and his other breaches. The great man replied, that it was not well done of us, but he had nothing to do with it, and ſo departed on his way. That night, after we came to a ſtrong large Town, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing our ſelves on the ſide of it, he did what he could (as we imagined) to rayſe up that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt us, ſome of them comming about us to view us, as we conceived, but putting on the beſt confidence we could, and ſtanding then upon our guard, and all of us watching that night, but (in a ſpecial manner) by the good providence of God, who kept us in all our journey, we here felt none of that miſchief we feared, but early in the morning quietly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted without the leaſt moleſtation. After which, with a little money, and a great many
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115803:105"/>
good words, we ſo quieted this man, that we never after heard any more complaining from him. So that (as before I obſerved) we were not at any time in any dangers of ſuffering by that people, but ſome of our own Nation were the procuring cauſes of it.</p>
               <p>For the people there, they are generally very Civil, and uſually keep themſelves ſo within the bounds of command received from their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, over which they do not paſs, as that they are not apt to take fire, and to throw off their voak, that they might do miſchief; They happily conſidering, that as in a <hi>natural,</hi> ſo in a <hi>body Politick,</hi> there muſt be hands and feet, as well as <hi>head</hi> and <hi>ſhoulders,</hi> all parts as well as any, the defect of the leaſt being ſo prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to both thoſe bodyes, that they know not how to want it; But for both, when they are fitted with all their integral parts, all mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers muſt do their ſeveral offices, the <hi>foot</hi> not medling with the buſineſs of the <hi>Head,</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to receive Commands from it. And therefore that precept of the Apoſtle, Epheſ. 6. 5. <hi>Servants be obedient unto them that are your Maſters according to the fleſh &amp;c.</hi> though they never learn'd it from S. <hi>Paul,</hi> yet having found that leſſon cleerly written even in the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> with all carefulneſs they remember, and with all diligence they practiſe it, as well knowing the abſolute neceſſity of ſuperiority,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:115803:105"/>
and inferiority amongſt men, that ſome muſt <hi>give,</hi> others muſt <hi>take command;</hi> for were it not for thoſe <hi>cords</hi> to lead ſome, and to <hi>hamper</hi> and reſtrain others, there were no living for men amongſt men, but one would deſtroy another, as the <hi>Beaſts</hi> of the field, the <hi>Fowles</hi> of the Air, and <hi>Fiſhes</hi> of the Sea do; were it not for thoſe ligaments and tyes, the very <hi>ſinewes</hi> and <hi>nerves</hi> of every Kingdom and Commonwealth would crack aſunder, and all would run into confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>I have often heard it obſerved of the <hi>Welſh,</hi> that they are <hi>Optimi ſervi,</hi> but <hi>Peſſimi Domini,</hi> ill Maſters, but good ſervants. I ſhall not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enquire into the truth of that proverbial ſpeech; but, for this people, this I can affirm; that they are excellent ſervants, who are as much at the command of their Maſters, as the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> after the death of <hi>Moſes,</hi> were unto <hi>Joſhua, Joſh.</hi> 1. 17. there telling him, <hi>all that thou commandeſt us we will do, or whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thou ſendeſt us we will goe;</hi> Or as the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turions</hi> ſervants in the <hi>Goſpel</hi> were at the word of command to their Captain, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. 9. who, <hi>if he bad them go, they went, if come, they came, if do this, or that, they did it:</hi> So theſe, if they be commanded to carry letters of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den many miles diſtant, from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they yield obedience in this, as to all other the commands of their Maſters, without regret
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:115803:106"/>
or diſpute, not <hi>objecting</hi> againſt, but doing the wills of thoſe that imploy them.</p>
               <p>Before I obſerved, that for the generality of this people they have very low and timorous ſpirits, but there are ſome I named in my laſt Section, who are ſtout daring men, as the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loches, Patans,</hi> and <hi>Raſhbootes,</hi> who, as they have the honour above all the reſt of the people in thoſe large Provinces to be accounted va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant; ſo, as occaſion is offered, they will ſhew themſelves ſo to be: and therefore they are much hyred as Convoyes to ſecure mens Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and goods, from place to place.</p>
               <p>For thoſe Provinces, they are not without <hi>Mountains of prey, and Tabernacles of Robbers,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> ſpeak, where deſperate men keep in ſome <hi>woods</hi> and <hi>deſerts,</hi> which are not far from great road-wayes, moſt frequented &amp; uſed, and there, like the wild <hi>Arabs,</hi> in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies meet, and ſpoyl, and deſtroy poor paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, when they expect them not; it being the curſed manner of thoſe <hi>ſpoylers,</hi> if they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt; them whom they ſurpriſe, to kill them before they rifle them, and therefore the firſt thing heard from them is, <hi>Mor, mor, mor,</hi> that is, Kill, kill, kill, which they all ſpeak out as loud as they can. We were often told of them as we travelled ſometimes in the night, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the extreme heat of the day, after we had taken leave of the King; and ſo wer jour|
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:115803:106"/>
journeying towards <hi>Surat,</hi> that we ſhould meet with thoſe cruell <hi>villans,</hi> but, through Gods mercy, we were never in danger of them but once, and that was about midnight, neer a large City called <hi>Brodera,</hi> but we being a competent number of Engliſh men together, about twenty, and all of us reſolved to fell our lives at as dear a rate as we could, and having twice ſo many <hi>Indian</hi> ſervants with us, which are very nimble with their Bows and Arrowes, we with our Piſtols and Carbines, which we preſently diſcharged amongſt them, and our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> plying them with their arrowes, made them ſuddenly to retreat, we receiving little hurt from them, but after this we made no more night <hi>marches.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> I named before, are ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to their truſts unto whomſoever they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as well as to any <hi>other,</hi> that if they be at any time aſſaulted, they will rather dye in their defence, than forſake them at their need. So that I am very confident, that if an Engliſh Merchant ſhould travel alone with a very great treaſure in <hi>gold,</hi> and <hi>Jewels,</hi> both, or either, from <hi>Surat</hi> to <hi>Lahor,</hi> which is more than one thouſand Engliſh miles, and take thoſe <hi>Indian</hi> ſervants only for his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and guard, and all they knew what be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with him, He paying them their wages, they would be ſo far from injuring him of the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115803:107"/>
leaſt penny of his wealth, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſhould attempt his ſpoyling, muſt make a way through their blood, before they ſhould be able to do it</p>
               <p>Here is a great and good example of Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and it is very true. But I much doubt, that if a great <hi>Indian</hi> Merchant, I mean a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of that Countrey, ſhould come for <hi>England</hi> with the like treaſure, with a deſire to paſs through this whole nation, and ſhould for his more ſafe paſſage take a guard of ſword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men here, and pay them well for their ſervice, they might lye under ſuch a ſtrong tentation, as might make them to ſpoyl the <hi>Egyptian,</hi> by ſhortning his journey, dividing his ſubſtance, and by diſpoſing ſo of his perſon, that it ſhould never tell tales.</p>
               <p>But for that people, as their faithfulneſs is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remarkable, ſo is their diligence very exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary likewiſe; for they keep continually within the call of their Maſters, and will not at any time depart thence without ſpecial leave. And the plenty of all proviſions being very great throughout the whole <hi>Monarchy,</hi> they ſerve at very low rates, which I never knew them to rayſe, not requiring more than five ſhillings ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings every new Moon, payd the next day after its Change, which is all the recompence they do deſire, or expect from their Maſters, to provide themſelves with all neceſſaries</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of their buildings in Villages, Townes, and Cities. How their Houſes are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. Of their Sarraes or houſes for the entertainment of Paſſengers. Of their Tents, Wells, and of their places of pleaſure, &amp;c.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Obſerved before the Richneſs of their Soyl, and how thoſe Provinces are watered by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny goodly Rivers, fed with abundance of Springs and how their fields are clothed with very much plenty of <hi>Corn</hi> of divers kind, ſold there at ſuch low rates that every one may there eat bread without ſcarceneſs.</p>
               <p>Now I come to take notice of their buildings; and here I muſt tell my Reader, that this people are not much taken or infected with that plague of building (as the <hi>Italians</hi> call it) wiſhing the love of it as a Curſe to poſſes the thoughts of them they moſt hate; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as the <hi>ſtones</hi> in <hi>India</hi> are not all precious, ſo the <hi>houſes</hi> there are not at all <hi>Palaces;</hi> the poor there cannot erect for their dwellings fair <hi>Piles,</hi> and the <hi>Grandees</hi> do not cover their heads under ſuch curious <hi>Roofs,</hi> as many of the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans</hi> doe; the reaſon, firſt, becauſe all the
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115803:109"/>
great men there live a great part of the year, (in which their Moneths are more temperate, as from the middle of <hi>September,</hi> to the middeſt of <hi>April)</hi> in <hi>Tents, Pavilions,</hi> or moveable ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations, which, according to their Fancyes, they remoove from place to place, changing their air as often as they pleaſe. And ſecondly, becauſe all the great men there have their <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi> and whole ſubſiſtence from the <hi>King,</hi> which they hold upon very fickle and uncertain tearmes; for as they are ſetled upon, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued unto them by the Kings favour, ſo are they forfeited and loſt by his frown. Of which more afterward.</p>
               <p>Yet though they make not much uſe of them, they have in plenty, excellent good materials for building, as Timber, Bricks, ſtone and marble of divers kinds and colours, of which I have ſeen ſome very good <hi>Vaults</hi> and <hi>Arches,</hi> well wrought, as in their <hi>Moſquits</hi> or Churches, ſo in ſome of their high erected <hi>Tombos,</hi> (of which more afterward) and ſo in ſome other places likewiſe.</p>
               <p>For their buildings in Cities and Towns, there are ſome of them handſome, others fair, ſuch as are inhabited by Merchants, and none of them very deſpicable.</p>
               <p>They build their houſes <hi>low,</hi> not above two <hi>ſtories,</hi> and many of their topps <hi>flat,</hi> and <hi>thick,</hi> which keep off the violence of the heat, and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:115803:109"/>
thoſe flat topps ſupported with ſtrong Timber, and coated over with a <hi>plaſter</hi> (like that we call plaſter of <hi>Paris)</hi> keep them dry in the times of the <hi>Raines.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>After this manner (as it appeares in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred ſtorie) the Jewes were wont to build, for <hi>David from the Roof of his houſe,</hi> 2 Sam. 11. 2. <hi>eſpies an object, &amp;c.</hi> ſuch a one, as if God had not been very mercifull, was ſufficient to have undone him for ever, as they write of the <hi>Baſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisk,</hi> that it kills by ſight.</p>
               <p>By the way, let me here further adde, that <hi>Davids</hi> eyes thus wandred to fetch home a temptation, immediatly after he had riſen from the bed of idlleneſs and eaſe; for while he was imployed in <hi>buſineſs,</hi> he was <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>ſafe.</hi> The <hi>induſtrious</hi> have not ſuch leiſure to <hi>ſin,</hi> as the <hi>idle</hi> have, who have neither <hi>leiſure,</hi> nor <hi>power</hi> to avoid <hi>it.

               <p>That which <hi>David</hi> here did, (and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grievouſly repents for ſo doing,) ſhall one day be the wofull ſong of many a wretched ſoul; as the <hi>Laſcivious</hi> mans ſong; the <hi>Covetous</hi> mans ſong, the ſong of <hi>Theeves, Idolaters, Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons, Drunkards,</hi> as of <hi>others.

               <p>There <hi>Bathſheba</hi> was waſhing herſelf from her uncleaneſs, and preſently after in an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous bed, became more unclean than ever ſhe was before; never was <hi>Bathſheba</hi> more foul than when ſhe was newly waſhed, the <hi>worſt</hi> of <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> being <hi>cleanlineſs</hi> to the <hi>beſt</hi> of <hi>Sin.</hi> But I proceed.</p>
               <p>Thoſe houſes of two ſtories, have many of them very large upper roomes, which have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny double doores in the ſides of them, like thoſe in our <hi>Balconies,</hi> to open and let in freſh air, which is likewiſe conveyed in unto them, by many leſſer lights made in the walls of thoſe roomes, which are always free and open; The uſe of glaſs windows, or any other ſhuttings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not known there, nor in any other very hot Countreyes.</p>
               <p>Neither have they any Chimneyes in their
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:115803:110"/>
buildings, becauſe they never make any uſe of fire but to dreſs their food, which fire they make againſt ſome firm wall, or without their <hi>Tents</hi> againſt ſome bank of <hi>Earth,</hi> as remo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e as may be from the places where they uſe to keep, that they may receive no annoyance from the heat thereof.</p>
               <p>It is their manner in many places, to plant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and amongſt their buildings, trees which grow high and broad, the ſhadow whereof keeps their houſes by far more cool; this I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in a ſpecial manner when we were ready to enter <hi>Amadavar,</hi> for it appeared to us, as if we had been entring a Wood, rather than a City. That <hi>Amadavar</hi> is a very large and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous City, entred by many fair Gates girt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with an high and thick Wall of Brick, which mounts above the topps of their houſes, without which wall there are no ſuburbs. Moſt of the houſes within the City are of Brick, and very many of them ridged &amp; covered with tiles.</p>
               <p>But for their houſes in their <hi>Aldeas,</hi> or <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages,</hi> which ſtand very thick in that Country, they are generally very <hi>poor</hi> and <hi>baſe.</hi> All thoſe Countrey dwellings are ſet up cloſe together, for I never obſerved any houſe there to ſtand ſingle, and alone. Some of their houſes in thoſe villages are made with earthen walls, mingled with ſtraw, ſet up immediatly after their <hi>Raines,</hi> and having a long ſeaſon after to dry them
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:115803:111"/>
throughly, ſtand firm, and ſo continue; they are built low, and many of them flat: but for the generality of thoſe Countrey <hi>Villages,</hi> the <hi>Cottages</hi> in them are miſerably <hi>poor, little,</hi> and <hi>baſe;</hi> ſo that as they are built with a very little charge, ſet up with ſticks rather than Timber, (if they chance to fire, as many times they do) for a very little they may be reedified.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who inhabit the Countrey Villages, are called <hi>Coolees,</hi> theſe till the ground, and breed up Cattel, and other things for proviſion, as <hi>Henns</hi> &amp;c. Theſe they who plant the <hi>Sugar,</hi> the <hi>Cotten-wooll,</hi> and <hi>Indico</hi> &amp;c.—for their <hi>Trades</hi> and <hi>manifactures</hi> they are kept in <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Towns,</hi> about which are their choiceſt fruits planted. In their Cities and Towns, without their dwellings, but fix't to them, are <hi>pend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes</hi> where they ſhew and ſell their proviſions, as bread, and <hi>flower-Cakes</hi> made up with <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> and fruits, and other things, and there they ſhew their manifactures, and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, ſome of which they carry twice every day to ſell in the <hi>Bazar</hi> or Market.</p>
               <p>I ſaw two houſes of the <hi>Mogols,</hi> one at <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doa,</hi> the other at <hi>Amadaver,</hi> which appeared large and ſtately, built of excellent ſtone well ſquared and put together, each of them taking up a large compaſs of ground, but we could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee how they were contrived, within becauſe there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are none admitted, ſtrangers or others, to

               <p>The <hi>Mogols</hi> Palace Royal is at <hi>Agra</hi> his <hi>Metropolis</hi> (of which more afterward) but for the preſent I ſhall take a little notice of a very curious <hi>Gro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> I ſaw belonging to his houſe at <hi>Mandoa,</hi> which ſtood a ſmall diſtance from it, for the building of which there was a way made into a firm Rock, which ſhewed it ſelf on the ſide of an Hill, <hi>Canopied</hi> over with part of that Rock. It was a place that had much beauty in it by reaſon of the Curious work-manſhip beſtowed on it; and much pleaſure by reaſon of its cooleneſs.</p>
               <p>That City <hi>Mandoa</hi> I ſpeak of, is ſituated upon a very high mountain, the to whereof is flat, and plain, and ſpecious. From all parts that lye about it but one, the aſcent is very high, and ſteep; and the way to us ſeemed exceeding long, for we were two whole dayes Climbing up the Hill, with our Cariages, vvhich vve got up vvith very much difficulty; not far from the bottom of vvhich Hill, vve lodged at a great tovvn called <hi>Achabar-pore,</hi> vvhere vve ferried over a broad River (as vve did in other places) for I obſerved no bridges made there, over any of their Rivers vvhere their high-vvayes lye.

(as it vvere) vvith fair trees, that keep their diſtance ſo one from and belovv the other, that there is much delight in beholding them either from the bottom or top of that Hill.</p>
               <p>In thoſe vaſt and far extended woods, there are <hi>Lions, Tygres,</hi> and other beaſts of Prey, and many wild <hi>Elephants.</hi> We lay one night in that wood with our Carriages, and thoſe <hi>Lions</hi> came about us diſcovering themſelves by their Roaring, but we keeping a very good fire all night, they came not neer enough to hurt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our ſelves, or cattel; thoſe Cruel Beaſts are night-walkers, for in the day they appear not.</p>

               <p>We were in our journey to the Court from the beginning of <hi>January</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

And after that, we were vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently deteined in our journey by <hi>Sultan Caroon</hi> the Prince, vvhom vve met in his march to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvards <hi>Brampore,</hi> &amp; a very marvelous great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue with him. The reaſon why he interrupted
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:115803:112"/>
us in our courſe was, that he might ſee the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents we had for his Father the King; but we having command from the Ambaſſador to tell him, that we durſt not open them, till we came to the King, we moſt humbly craved his pardon to ſpare us in that; ſo preſenting him with a pair of Rich <hi>Gloves</hi> (though they be things they wear not in thoſe hot Countryes) and a rich embrodered bag for perfume (which amongſt many other things of the like kinde were brought from <hi>England</hi> to be given away for preſents, after that he had carried us back three dayes journey, he let us go, taking further order for our ſafe Convoy.</p>
               <p>And now Reader, thou mayſt ſuppoſe us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſetled in <hi>Mandoa,</hi> the place then of the <hi>Mogols</hi> reſidence, not much inhabited before we came thither, having more <hi>ruines</hi> by far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, than ſtanding <hi>houſes.</hi> But amongſt the Piles of building that had held up their heads above <hi>Ruin,</hi> there were not a few unfrequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Moſquits</hi> or <hi>Mahometan</hi> Churches; yet I obſerved, that though the people who attended the King there, were marvailouſly ſtreightned for room, wherein they might diſpoſe of very great numbers of moſt excellent horſes, which were now at that place, they would not make ſtables of any of thoſe Churches, though before that time, they had been forſaken, and out of uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:115803:113"/>
One of thoſe deſerted <hi>Moſquites,</hi> with ſome large <hi>Tomb</hi> neer it, both vaulted over head (which ſhall be after deſcribed) were the beſt places there to be gotten for my Lord Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour and his Company to lodge and be in, we carrying our bedding, and all things apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayning thereto, all neceſſaries belonging to our Kitchin, and every thing beſide for bodily uſe, from place to place, as we occaſionally remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Here we ſtayed with the <hi>Mogol</hi> from the middle of <hi>April,</hi> till the twentieth of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> following and then began our progreſs with him, towards the City <hi>Amadavar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our abiding place at <hi>Mandoa,</hi> was very neer one of the ſides of that vaſt wilderneſs, out of which, ſome of thoſe wild beaſts ofttimes in the night came about our habitation, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom returned back without a <hi>Sheep</hi> or a <hi>Goate,</hi> or a <hi>Kid,</hi> ſome of which we always kept about us for our proviſion. And it was a wonderfull great mercy, thoſe furious, and ravening, and and hungerbit Creatures, did not make their prey ſometimes, in the dark and ſilent nights, while we were ſleeping, on ſome of our bodyes, the fore-part of our dwelling ſtanding upon pillars, and there was nothing in thoſe open di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that had any ſtrength in it to keep them from us.</p>
               <p>One night, early in the evening, there was a great <hi>Lion</hi> which we ſaw, came into our yard,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:115803:113"/>
though our yard was compaſſed about with a ſtone-wall, that was not low.) And my Lord Ambaſſadour having a little white neat <hi>ſhock,</hi> that ran out barking at him, the Lion prefently ſnapt him up, leapt again over the wall, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way he went.</p>
               <p>But for a ravening and roaring <hi>Lion,</hi> as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he cannot be made tame when he is old; yet certainly he may be bred tame, being kept full, and high fed. For the <hi>Mogol,</hi> at my being there, had a very great <hi>Lion</hi> (I often ſaw) which went up and down, amongſt the people that frequented his Court, gently as a dog, and never did hurt only he had ſome Keepers which did continually wayt upon him.</p>
               <p>For thoſe wild and Cruell Beaſts, one of our <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> watching in a tree by night; (that ſtood not far from our dwelling) with a fire-lock charged with ſome ſmall bullets, ſhot a <hi>Tygre,</hi> and kill'd him ſtone<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dead, as he was comming towards us. It was a large Beaſt, higher than an <hi>Iriſh-Greyhound,</hi> with Grizled hayr, a long head, and ſharp and ſhort picked eares, having a mouth filled with cruell teeth; after which (we uſually keeping a little fire without our houſe every night) were not ſo much troubled with thoſe night-walkers.</p>
               <p>Now to return to that from which I am oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally digreſſed. I told you before what their buildings are. And now for the furniture
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:115803:114"/>
that the greateſt men have in them, it is <hi>Curta ſupellex,</hi> very little; they being not beautified with hangings, nor with any thing beſides to line their walls, but where they are beſt adorned, they are kept very white, and ſet off with a little neat painting and nothing elſe; for they have no <hi>Chaires,</hi> nor <hi>ſtooles,</hi> nor <hi>couches,</hi> nor <hi>tables,</hi> nor <hi>bedds,</hi> encloſed with <hi>Canopies,</hi> or <hi>Curtains,</hi> in any of their rooms. And the truth is, that if they had them, the extreme heat there would forbid the uſe of many of them; all their brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is upon their <hi>ſloores,</hi> all which are made even with fine earth, or plaſter, on which they ſpead their moſt excellent <hi>Carpets</hi> in their Tents, as well as in their dwelling houſes, laying ſome Coarſe thing under to preſerve them; on which they ſit as <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>aylors</hi> on their ſhop-boards, when they meet together, putting off their ſhooes (which they uſually wear as ſlippers and their feet bare in them) when they come to tred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe ſoft <hi>Pavements,</hi> and keeping them off till they remoove thence, this helps to keep cool their feet, and is very pleaſant in thoſe hot Countreyes. On thoſe Carpets they ſleep in the night time, or elſe upon an hard quilt, or lying upon a ſlight and low bed-ſtead they call a <hi>Cot,</hi> bottomed with broad girt-web made of <hi>Cotten-Wool.</hi> But where ever they lye, they ſtretch themſelves out at their full length when they go to ſleep, uſually upon their backs, without any
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:115803:114"/>
pillow, or bolſter, to raiſe up their heads. Very many of the meaner ſort of people (as I have often obſerved) lye thus ſtretched out to take their reſt upon the ground, in the dry ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the year, with a white Callico Cloth ſpread all over them, which makes them to appear like ſo many dead corps layd forth for burial. This lying ſo even, and at length with their bodyes thus extended, may be one reaſon why the people there are all ſo ſtreight lim'd, having none crooked amongſt them, and another, becauſe they never girt, nor lace in their bodies (as before was obſerved). Some of thoſe ſlight bedſteads, they call <hi>Cotts,</hi> in their ſtanding houſes hang by rops, a little above ground, which are faſtned to the four corners thereof; moved gently up and down, by their ſervants, to lull them aſleep</p>
               <p>They have no <hi>Inns</hi> in thoſe parts for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of ſtrangers, but in ſome great Townes large Houſes they call <hi>Sarraas</hi> very ſubſtantially built, with brick, or ſtone, where any paſſengers may find houſe-room and uſe it without any recompence; but there is nothing to be had beſide room, all other things they muſt provide and bring with them, as when they lodge in Tents.</p>
               <p>Amongſt their buildings I muſt take ſpecial notice of their <hi>Wells</hi> and <hi>Tankes,</hi> upon both which in very many places they beſtow excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:115803:115"/>
much coſt in ſtone-work; for their <hi>Wells</hi> which are fed with Springs, they make them round, but very wide and large. They are wrought up with firm ſtones layd in fine Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; they uſually cover thoſe Wells with a buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding over head, and with <hi>Oxen</hi> draw water out of them, which riſeth up in many ſmall Buckets, whereof ſome are alwayes going down, others continually comming up, and emptying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in troughs, or little rills, made to receive, and Convey the water whither they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Tanks</hi> are made in low places, and many of them very deep and large, one mile, and ſome of them much more in compaſs, made round or four ſquare, or in more ſquares, about which there is a low ſtone-wall, that hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doors in it, and within that wall ſteps, made one below the other round about it, that go down to the bottom thereof, (which is paved likewiſe) thoſe ſteps are made of well ſquared laſting ſtone, layd firm, and even in very good order, for people that have not plenty of water otherwiſe, to go down and take it. Theſe great receptacles of water, are made neer places that are very populous, fill'd when that long ſeaſon of rain (before ſpoken of) comes, immediatly before which time, they clenſe them, that the water may be more cleer, and wholſom. They hold water all the dry ſeaſon of the year.</p>
               <p>For their places of pleaſure, they are in their
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:115803:115"/>
Groves, where their curious fruit-trees (before deſcribed) grow; but eſpecially in their Gardens, wherein they plant little vineyards that afford marvailous fair &amp; ſweet Grapes, which they cut green, for their eating, or make Reiſons of them. But for Wine, they make none, becauſe their <hi>Mahomet</hi> forbids the drinking thereof. In thoſe Gardens likewiſe, they have many <hi>Pome-Granat-trees,</hi> with all other of the choy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt <hi>fruits</hi> and <hi>flowers</hi> their Countrey affords; to which nature daily yields ſuch a ſupply, as that there is beauty to be ſeen in thoſe trees, and plants, and that continually. In the middle of thoſe Gardens, they have ſuch Wells (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are deſcribed) the topps whereof ſtand a good deal higher than the planted ground, which lyes even, and flat below them, from whence water is conveyed in narrow open paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, (they knowing not the uſe of leaden Pipes) to all the parts of them in the dry ſeaſon of the year. In thoſe Gardens likewiſe they have little round <hi>Tanks</hi> to bath in; whoſe ſides and Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes are made firm and ſmooth with that plaſter before named; they are fil'd by <hi>aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts</hi> from thoſe Wells, and they can empty them when they pleaſe, as well as fill them. The water that is conveyed into thoſe ſmall <hi>Tanks,</hi> uſually runns down broad ſtone Tables, that have many Hollowes made in them, like to <hi>ſcollop-ſhels,</hi> with water in its paſſage, makes
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:115803:116"/>
ſuch a pretty murmure, as helps to tye their ſenſes with the bonds of ſleep, in the hot ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the day when they conſtantly keep their houſes, and then they lye down neer them on their Carpetts, to be lul'd aſleep. Thoſe Bathing places are within, or very neer their Garden-houſes, which uſually are by far more neat, than any other of their dwelling.</p>
               <p>In ſuch a Garden-houſe, with all thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations about it, my Lord Ambaſſadour lay with his company at <hi>Surat,</hi> the laſt three moneths before he left <hi>Eaſt India.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And further, in thoſe hot ſeaſons of the day; the people of better quality lying or ſitting on their <hi>Carpets,</hi> or <hi>Pallats,</hi> have ſervants ſtanding about them, who continually beat the Air up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them with <hi>Flabellas,</hi> or <hi>Fanns,</hi> of ſtiffened leather, which keeps off the flyes from annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and cool them as they lye. Thus ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their eaſe, they call for <hi>Barbers,</hi> who very gently gripe their armes, and ſhoulders, and other parts, they can in any meaſure graſp, and they ſtrike likewiſe very ſoftly thoſe parts with the ſides of their hands; it is very pleaſing as they do it, and cauſeth their blood to ſtir in their veins, it is therefore very much uſed in thoſe parts, to ſuch as do not heat their blood by bodily motion.</p>
               <p>For their paſtimes within doores, they have <hi>Cards,</hi> but much different from ours in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:115803:116"/>
made in them, and in their greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſuits. Thoſe Cards I have often ſeen and have been more often told, that they have very good skill in that moſt innocent and ingenious game we call <hi>Cheſts.</hi>
               </p>

For their Paſtimes abroad they have <hi>Hawks</hi> of divers kinds, greater and leſs, and Partridges, and other choiſe Fowl grear ſtore to fly at. They have Hares, and Antilops, with other wild Beaſts to hunt, and theſe not a few. Their doggs for chafe are made ſomewhat like our Grey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds, but much leſs, who never open in the purſute of their game. They hunt likewiſe with Leopards train'd up and made fit for their ſport, who by leaping ſeize on that they purſue; but by reaſon of the heat of the Countrey, thoſe ſports are not there much uſed. The <hi>Mogol</hi> when he hunts, carryes Hawks and Doggs, and all things beſide with him, to make him Paſtime, that if one ſport fail, he may be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with another.</p>
               <p>They ſay, that they have a curious deviſe to take wild fouls that uſe the water, into which a fellowgoes, with a foul of that kinde he deſires to catch, whoſe skin is ſtuſſed ſo artificially, as that with a noyſe he counterfets of that foul, it appears to be alive, the man keeps all his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy but head under water, on which he faſtens that counterfet foul to ſtand foreright on the top thereof, and thus comming amongſt them, he plucks them (as they ſay) by their leggs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der water at his pleaſure. But this I have only by tradition.</p>
               <p>For other Paſtimes abroad, this I am ſure of, that when the weather is more temperate, they

               <p>AND though this Countrey affords very much variety of excellent good proviſions, yet the <hi>Mahometans</hi> feed not freely on any fleſh, but on that which is ſtrange, and forbidden (of the <hi>Hindooes</hi> diet I ſhall ſpeak afterwards) but for the <hi>Mahometans</hi> they are a people, as I conceive, not much given to their Palate, but are very carefull of, and temperate in their diet,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:115803:118"/>
as having learn'd by experience, that full bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyes do more oppreſs, than ſtrengthen the body, that too much of the Creature doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort but deſtroy Nature. It being a tryed truth, that Gluttony reacheth, and kills thoſe whom ſwords cannot touch. All diſeaſes of the body for the moſt part being contracted to it by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>etts, in one kinde or other, and therefore they keep themſelves to a thin diet, and eat not to pamper and pleaſe their appetite, but to ſatisfy and ſupport nature, which is contented with a little every where, but with leſs in hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes, where mens digeſtion of food is not ſo quick and good; this being further a tried truth, that thoſe bodyes are moſt ſtrong, active, and healthy, which are moſt temperate.</p>
               <p>Therefore though they have abundance of fleſh and foul, and have fiſh too, yet are they temperate in all of them. For Swines fleſh it is an abomination unto the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and therefore they touch it not. And for other kinde of fleſh, they eat very little of them alone, to make their full meals of them, for they dreſs no kinde of fleſh in great peeces, or whole joynts, nor ſcarce any of their Foules whole.</p>
               <p>For boyling of fleſh in water, or Baking or Roſting any fleſh, are peeces of Cookery (if I obſerved well) they know not; but they ſtew all their fleſh as their Kid, and other Veniſon, &amp;c. cut into ſippets, or flices, or little parts, to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:115803:118"/>
which they put Onions and Herbs and Roots, and Ginger (which they take there Green out of earth) and other Spices, with ſome Butter, which ingredients when as they are well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned, make a food that is exceedingly pleaſing to all Palates, at their firſt taſting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of moſt ſavoury meat, happily that very diſh which <hi>Jacob</hi> made for his Father <hi>Iſaac,</hi> when he got the bleſſing <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.</p>
               <p>With their fleſh and herbs, &amp;c. they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtew Henns and other foul cut in peeces, which is like that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call an <hi>Olio,</hi> but more toothſome.</p>
               <p>But their great common ſtanding diſh there is Rice, which they boyl with more art than we: for they boyl the grain ſo as that it is full and plump and tender, but not broken in boyling: they put to it a little green Ginger, and Pepper, and Butter, and this is the ordinary way of their dreſſing it and ſo tis very good.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they boyl peeces of fleſh, or Hens, and other foul cut in peeces in their Rice, which diſh they call <hi>Pillaw;</hi> as they order it, they make it a very excellent, and a very well-taſted food.</p>
               <p>Once my Lord Ambaſſadour had an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment there by <hi>Aſaph Chan,</hi> who invited him to dinner (and this was the only reſpect in that kinde he ever had, while he was in <hi>Eaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia)</hi> That <hi>Aſaph Chan</hi> was a man made by
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:115803:119"/>
his great alliances, the greateſt ſubject and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourit in all that Empire; for his ſiſter was the <hi>Mogols</hi> moſt beloved wife, and his daughter was married unto <hi>Sultan Caroon</hi> the Prince, and very much beloved by him, but of all theſe, more afterward.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Aſaph Chan</hi> entertained my Lord Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour in a very ſpacious and a very beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Tent, where none of his followers beſides my ſelf, ſaw, or taſted of that entertainment.</p>
               <p>That Tent was kept full of a very pleaſant Perfume; in which ſents the King and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dees there take very much delight. The floor of the Tent was firſt covered all over with very rich and large Carpets, which were covered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in the places where our dinner ſtood, with other good Carpets, made of ſtich't Leather, to preſerve them which were richer; and theſe were covered again with pure white and fine Callico Clothes, and all theſe covered with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many diſhes of ſilver, but for the greater part of thoſe ſilver diſhes they were not larger than our largeſt trencher-plates, the brimms of all of them gilt.</p>
               <p>We ſate in that large Room as it were in a Triangle; The Ambaſſadour on <hi>Aſaph Chans</hi> right hand a good diſtance from him, and my ſelf below; all of us on the ground, as they there all do when as they eat, with our faces looking each to the other, and every one of us had his
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:115803:119"/>
ſeveral meſs. The Ambaſſadour had more diſhes by ten, and I leſs by ten, than our enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer had, yet for my part I had fifty diſhes. They were all ſet before us at once, and little paths left betwixt them, that our entertainers ſervants (for onely they waited) might come and reach them to us one after another, and ſo they did. So that I taſted of all ſet before me, and of moſt did but taſt, though all of them ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted very well.</p>
               <p>Now of the proviſion it ſelf, for our larger diſhes, they were filled with Rice, dreſſed (as before deſcribed) And this Rice was preſented to us, ſome of it white, in its own proper co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, ſome of it made yellow with Saffron, and ſome of it was made green, and ſome of it put into a purple colour, but by what ingredient I know not, but this I am ſure, that it all taſted very well; And with Rice thus ordered ſeveral of our diſhes were furniſhed; and very many more of them with fleſh of ſeveral kinds, and with Hens, and with other ſorts of foul cut in peeces, as before I obſerved in <hi>their Indian Cookery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe we had many Jellie, and Culices; Rice ground to flower, and then boyled, and after ſweetned with Sugar-Candy and Roſe-water to be eaten cold. The flower of Rice mingled with ſweet Almonds, made as ſmall as they could, and with ſome of the moſt fleſhy
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:115803:120"/>
parts of Henns, ſtewed with it, and after, the fleſh ſo beaten into peeces, that it could not be diſcern'd, all made ſweet with <hi>Roſe-water</hi> and <hi>Suger-Candy,</hi> and ſented with <hi>Amber-Grec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e;</hi> this was another of our diſhes, and a moſt luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious one, which the <hi>Portugals</hi> call <hi>Mangee Real,</hi> Food for a King. Many other diſhes we had, made up in <hi>Cakes,</hi> of ſeveral formes, of the fineſt of the wheat-flower, mingled with <hi>Almonds,</hi> and <hi>Sugar Candy,</hi> whereof ſome were ſented and ſome not. To theſe <hi>Potatoes</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently well dreſſed; and to them divers <hi>Salads</hi> and the curious fruits of that Countrey, ſome preſerved in <hi>Sugar,</hi> and others raw, and to theſe many <hi>Roots</hi> Candied, <hi>Almonds</hi> blanched, <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> of the Sun, <hi>Prunellas,</hi> and I know not what, of all enough to make up that number of diſhes before named; and with theſe <hi>quelque choſe,</hi> was that entertainment made up.</p>
               <p>And it was better a great deal, than if it had conſiſted of full &amp; heaped up diſhes, ſuch as are ſometimes amongſt us provided, for great and profuſe entertainments. Our bread was of very good excellent wheat, made up very white and light, in round <hi>Cakes;</hi> and for our drink, ſome of it was brew'd for ought I know, ever ſince <hi>Noah his flood,</hi> that good innocent water, being all the drink there commonly uſed (as before) and in thoſe hot Clymates (it being better digeſted there than in other parts)
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:115803:120"/>
it is very ſweet, and allayes thirſt better than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other liquor can, and therefore better plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and agreeth better with every man, that comes and lives there, than any other drink.</p>
               <p>At this entertainment we ſat long, and much longer than we could with eaſe croſs leg'd, but all conſidered, our feaſt in that place was better than <hi>Apicius,</hi> that famous <hi>Epicure</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> with all his witty Gluttony (for ſo <hi>Paterculus</hi> calls it, <hi>ingenioſa Gula,)</hi> could have made with all proviſions had from the <hi>Earth,</hi> and <hi>Air,</hi> and <hi>Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lord Ambaſſadour obſerved not that uneaſy way of ſitting at his meat, but in his own houſe had <hi>Tables</hi> and <hi>Chayres</hi> &amp;c. ſerved he was altogether in <hi>Plate,</hi> and had an <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and an <hi>Indian</hi> Cook to dreſs his dyer, which was very plentifull, and cheap likewiſe; ſo that by reaſon of the great variety of proviſions there, his weekly account for his houſe-keeping came but to little.</p>
               <p>The meaner ſort of people there eat <hi>Rice</hi> boyled with their <hi>green-Ginger,</hi> and a little <hi>Pepper,</hi> after which they put Butter into it, which is their principal diſh, and but ſeldom eaten by them: but their ordinary food is made (not of the flowr of wheat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) but of a courſe well taſted grain, made up in round broad and thick Cakes, which they bake upon their thin iron plates (before ſpoken of) which they carry
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:115803:121"/>
with them, when as they travell from place to place; when they have bak'd thoſe cakes, they put a little butter on them, and doubtleſs the poor people find this a very hearty food<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for they who live moſt upon it, are as ſtrong as they could be, if they had their diet out of the Kings Kitchin.

               <p>AND here the people in general (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was obſerved) are as civil to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as to their own Countrey-men; for they uſe when they meet one another, or when they meet ſtrangers, to bow their heads, or to lay their right hands on their breſts, and to bow their bodyes as they paſs, ſaluting them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with many well-wiſhes.</p>
               <p>They uſe not to uncover their heads at all, as we do in our ſalutes, (from which cuſtom of ours, the <hi>Turks</hi> borrow this imprecation for their enemies, wiſhing their ſouls no more reſt after death than a Chriſtians hat hath, which

               <p>When we viſite the <hi>people</hi> there, of better <hi>quality,</hi> they entertain us with much humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, firſt riſing up to us, they bow their bodyes, and then intreat us to ſit with them on their Carpets, where they are free in their diſcourſe, which we uſually exchange with them by an Interpreter. If we have any buſineſs with them, they return very civill and fair anſwers, and for our further entertainment give us <hi>Beetle</hi> or <hi>Paune</hi> to chew (before ſpoken of)</p>
               <p>In their neer, and more cloſe and hearty Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes, they do not joyn hands as we, but do that which is hatefull to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and not at all in uſe with us; for they take one another by the Chin, or Beard, and cry. <hi>Bobba,</hi> which is Father, or <hi>Bij,</hi> which is Brother: and this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to be a very ancient Complement, for thus <hi>Joab</hi> long ago ſaluted <hi>Amaſa,</hi> 2 Sam. 20. 9 but this they do in love, not as <hi>Joab</hi> did there, in treacherie.</p>
               <p>In their Complements they expreſs many

good wiſhes to one another, as <hi>Salam Alla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum,</hi> God give you health; the reply, <hi>Alla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum Salam,</hi> the ſame health God give you.

As inferiour people (who have their dependance on others) uſe to ſay unto them, <hi>I eat your Breat and Salt</hi> (as much to ſay) I am your ſervant, I live by you, and you may do <hi>with me,</hi> or <hi>to me,</hi> what you pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Now as this people of <hi>Eaſt India</hi> are Civil in their ſpeeches, ſo are they Civilly clad, for there are none who weare their own skin alone for their covering, as very many in the Weſtern <hi>India</hi> do.</p>
               <p>For the Habites of this people, from the higheſt to the loweſt, they are all made of the ſame faſhion, which they never alter, nor change; their Coats ſitting cloſe to their bodyes unto their waſts, then hanging down looſe a little below their knees, the lower part of them ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſomewhat full; thoſe cloſe Coats are faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto both their ſhoulders, with ſlips made of the ſome cloth, which for the generality, are
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:115803:122"/>
all made of courſer, or finer white <hi>Callico;</hi> and in like manner are they faſtned to their waſt, on both ſides thereof, which Coats coming double over their breſts, are faſtned by like ſlips of cloth, that are put thick from their left arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes to their middle; The ſleeves of thoſe coats are made long and ſomewhat cloſe to their Armes, that they may <hi>ruffle,</hi> eſpecially from their elbowes, to their wriſts. Under this Coate they uſually weare another ſleight one, made of the ſame cloth, but ſhorter than the other, and this is all they commonly weare upon the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part of their bodies. But ſome of the greater ſort in the cooler ſeaſons of the day there, will ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Under their Coats they have long <hi>breeches</hi> like unto <hi>Iriſh-Trouſes,</hi> made uſually of the ſame Cloth, which come to their Ankles, and <hi>ruffle</hi> on the ſmall of their leggs. For their feet they keep them (as was before obſerved) alwayes bare in their ſhooes.</p>
               <p>Some of their <hi>Grandees</hi> make their Coats and Breeches of ſtriped <hi>Taffata</hi> of ſeveral co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, or of ſome other ſilk ſtuff all of the ſame colour, or of ſlight cloth of <hi>Silver</hi> or <hi>Gold,</hi> all made in that Countrey. But pure white and fine <hi>Callico-Laune,</hi> (which they there make like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) is for the moſt part the height of all their
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115803:123"/>
bravery; the collars, and ſome other parts of their upper coats, being ſet off with ſome neat ſtitching.</p>
               <p>Upon their heads they weare a long wreath of cloth, about half a yard broad, uſually white, but ſometimes of other colours. Which cloth worn for their head covering, is ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-woven in ſpaces with <hi>threds</hi> of coloured <hi>ſilk,</hi> or <hi>ſilver,</hi> or <hi>gold,</hi> and when not ſo, one end of that wreath of cloth worn by <hi>Gallants</hi> is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus interwoven, and ſo put upon their heads, that its gayneſs may appear. This head-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of theirs, they call a <hi>Shaſh,</hi> which incircles their heads many times, and doth mervailouſly defend them from the violence of the Sun. And becauſe this covering muſt needs keep their heads hot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they provide for this, as well as they can, by ſhaving the haire continually from off them. And they have <hi>girdles</hi> made of the ſame <hi>wreaths</hi> of cloth for the better ſort, thus <hi>interwoven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> which come twice at leaſt about them, made very trim with that kinde of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, eſpecially on both ends, which hangdown directly before them.</p>
               <p>And thus have I preſented a <hi>Mahometan</hi> there in his proper dreſs, whoſe habit will more viſibly appear together in the <hi>Mogols</hi> Picture, portrayed and after put into this diſcourſe.</p>

I cannot give ſuch an account of them in reſpect of the Habits; for theſe, unleſs they be diſhoneſt, or poor, come not abroad; but for the faſhion of their garments, they do not differ much from thoſe the men weare, for they weare Coats, and Breeches one very like the other, onely women bind their long haire with <hi>Philets,</hi> which hang down behind them. They wear likewiſe upon their heads <hi>Mantles</hi> or <hi>Vailes</hi> (uſually made of white <hi>Callico,</hi> or of their <hi>Pintadoes)</hi> which hang down over their other garments. Further, the women have their <hi>Eares</hi> boared, not only in their flapps, but round about them, wherein they weare very little <hi>Pendants;</hi> thoſe of the richer ſort are made of flat, narrow and thin peeces of <hi>Gold</hi> or <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;</hi> thoſe worn by the poorer ſort made of <hi>Braſs,</hi> or <hi>Iron</hi> kept bright, ſo that all are in the ſame faſhion; they beſtow ſome work upon the edges and ends of thoſe <hi>Pendants.</hi> And thoſe women have the lower part of their left <hi>noſtrils</hi> pierced, wherein they weare a <hi>Ring</hi> (when they pleaſe) of <hi>Gold,</hi> or <hi>Silver,</hi> or of ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther baſer metals.

I might hereunto add the many <hi>trickings</hi> and <hi>trimmings</hi> of ſome likewiſe which appear in that place, very much unbecomming the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of their profeſſion; In which reſpect, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and comelineſs which hath appeared in others, in thoſe particulars I named, may be a ſtrongwitneſs againſt them; in others, who have been thought fit to be removed from their places, and to be thereby layd aſide; In others, who have made room for thoſe, either by their death, or otherwiſe.

               <p>But for others whom before I named, rather than they will not come up unto this height of vanitie, they make the haire of Women, which before was dead, to live again (as it were) upon their heads.

               <p>For outward <hi>beauty,</hi> without doubt it is an excellent gift of God, and ſo to be eſteemed; but when the <hi>Soul</hi> anſwers not the <hi>face,</hi> in not being beautifull like it, it leads to a Curſe.

               <p>But why do I ſpend ſo much <hi>time,</hi> and <hi>ink,</hi> and <hi>paper,</hi> in ſuch a ſeeming <hi>impertinent, unplauſible,</hi> and <hi>unprofitable</hi> reproof? for though that which I have named be ſuch a fault in this Nation, as no language can ever excuſe, and no time, I fear, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; becauſe the people of this Land by a long cuſtome, and continuance, do chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge ſuch a propriety in new faſhions, are ſo habituated to them, that in probability nothing which can fall, either from the tongues, or penns of men ſhall ever be able to reform it.</p>
               <p>Yet before I leave this juſt reproof, I ſhall add a few words more, for thoſe that invent, and urge arguments in the defence thereof; as firſt, ſome ſay that theſe new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented things, which multiply faſhions, ſerve to keep, and maintain many poor people in work: To theſe I anſwer, as it was ſpoken of <hi>Judas,</hi> when he grumbled at the expence
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115803:130"/>
of that <hi>oynment</hi> beſtowed on our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour,</hi> John 12. 5. 6. ſaying, <hi>This might have been ſold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor;</hi> but this he ſaid (ſaith the text) <hi>not that he cared for the poor,</hi> &amp;c. So, this ſome ſpeak, not that they love the poor, but the faſhion; which poor doubtleſs might finde as comfortable a ſubſiſtence, if they were not thus imployed. And Secondly, whereas others pretend, and ſay that their hearts may be good and humble, whatſoever their habits be, I dare conclude, that it is as impoſſible for a <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>humble,</hi> and <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt heart</hi> to dwell under a vain and fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick habit, as for <hi>evill</hi> to be <hi>good.</hi>

               <p>I know that it is a very ſtrange Caſe which can finde no Advocate; A <hi>poyſoned pill</hi> may be gilded over, as well as that which is wholeſome. <hi>Favorinus</hi> long agoe wrote in the Commendation of a <hi>Quartan Ague.</hi> That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="231" facs="tcp:115803:130"/>
till they ſindge their wings, and fall into it. Let me ſpeak therefore as a Divine to all thoſe which plead for new faſhions, and therefore think they may be, becauſe they are generally taken up, and followed. That ſinns are by ſo much the greater, by how much they are more general and univerſal, and that ſin is ſo far from being extenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the multitude of offenders, which live under the guilt thereof, that nothing can more aggravate it.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of their Language, their Books, their Learning, &amp;c.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE <hi>Language</hi> of this Empire, I mean the Vulgar, bears the name of it, and is called <hi>Indoſtan;</hi> it hath much affinitie with the <hi>Perſian,</hi> and <hi>Arabian</hi> tongues, but the <hi>Indoſtan</hi> is a ſmoother language, and more eaſy to be pronounced than the other, a language which is very ſignificant, and ſpeaks much in few words; They write it (as we) to the right hand. It is expreſſed by letters, which are very much different from thoſe <hi>Alphabets,</hi> by which the <hi>Perſian</hi> and <hi>Arabian</hi> tongues are formed. The <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> there is ſpoken as their more quaint and Court-tongue. The <hi>Arabian</hi> is their learned language, both written backward to the left hand like the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> from whence they borrow many words, which come ſo neer it, as that he who is a good <hi>Critick</hi> in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> may very well gueſs at the meaning of much in both thoſe languages. The <hi>Perſian</hi> is a language, as if it conſiſted all of <hi>Guttur all letters,</hi> (as ſome
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:115803:131"/>
in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Alphabet are called) filling the mouth in the Pronunciation of them; for as the words in that language are full of <hi>ſenſe:</hi> ſo in their ſpeaking they are full of <hi>ſound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> by which there hath been ſo much knowledge conveyed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, they are as ignorant of them both, as if they had never been; and this may be one great reaſon why there is ſo little learning amongſt them. But for the people themſelves, they are men of very ſtrong reaſon, and will ſpeak <hi>ex re natâ,</hi> upon any offered occaſion, very exceeding well; and doubtleſs they are a people of ſuch ſtrong Capacities, that were there litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture amongſt them, they might be the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi> of many excellent <hi>works;</hi> but as the caſe ſtands with them, all that is there at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable towards learning, is but to read and write.</p>
               <p>And here by the way let me inſert this, that I never ſaw any <hi>Idiot</hi> or natural <hi>Fool,</hi> nor any <hi>deformed</hi> perſon amongſt them, in any of thoſe parts.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Logick</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick</hi> which are ſo inſtrumental, the firſt to enlarge, and the ſecond to poliſh diſcourſes, they have none but what is <hi>Natural.</hi> They ſay, that they
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:115803:132"/>
write ſome witty <hi>Poems,</hi> and compoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny handſome <hi>Annals</hi> and <hi>Stories</hi> of their own, and other adjacent Countreys.</p>
               <p>They delight much in <hi>Muſick,</hi> and have ſome ſtringed, but many more winde Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; They have the uſe of <hi>Timbrils</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; but for want of pleaſing <hi>Airs,</hi> their <hi>Muſick</hi> in my ears never ſeemed to be any thing but <hi>diſcord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their <hi>Books</hi> are not many, and thoſe are <hi>Manuſcripts.</hi> That rare and happie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of <hi>Printing,</hi> which hath been the advancement of ſo much learning within <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> is not known <hi>without</hi> it.</p>
               <p>They have heard of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> whom they call <hi>Aplis,</hi> and have ſome of his books (as they ſay) in the <hi>Arabian</hi> tongue, in which language (they further ſay) they have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny books written by <hi>Avicenna,</hi> that anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Phyſician, who was born in <hi>Samar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandia,</hi> one of the moſt fam'd places within the <hi>Tartarian</hi> Empire, the Countrey (as they believe) where <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gols</hi> great Anceſtor, drew his firſt breath.</p>
               <p>Some parts or fragments they have of the old <hi>Teſtament;</hi> of which more, when I ſhall come to ſpeak of their Religion.</p>
               <p>Many amongſt them profeſs themſelves to have great skill in judicial. <hi>Aſtrologie,</hi>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:115803:132"/>
that great <hi>Cheat,</hi> which hath been very an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, and often put upon (as the Sacred Storie witneſſeth) the people inhabiting the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> and <hi>South</hi> parts of the world. I call it a <hi>Cheat,</hi> becauſe there is, and muſt needs be, ſo much uncertainty in it, all things here below being ordered, and overruled, by the ſecret, and unerring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Almighty God, <hi>which fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the tokens of the Lyars, and maketh Diviners mad, that turneth wiſe men back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and maketh their knowledge fooliſh,</hi> Eſay 44. 25. Firſt, theſe Diviners are <hi>mad</hi> when things fall not out according to their bold predictions; And ſecondly, they have been, and not without cauſe, eſteemed as <hi>mad-men,</hi> in foretelling things which they could not know, and much leſs bring to paſs.</p>
               <p>And therefore I have heard a great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in, and a publick Profeſſor of <hi>Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie,</hi> who could ſee as far into <hi>Conſtellations</hi> and obſerve as much from them as, any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, often ſay, that he would go by the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſelfeſame rules that others did, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict things to come, and would write that which was quite contrary to what they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, yet what he wrote ſhould as often fall to be as true as what they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:115803:133"/>
Yet notwithſtanding the truth of theſe premiſes, the great <hi>Mogol</hi> puts ſo much confidence in his <hi>Astrologers,</hi> that he will not undertake a journey, nor yet reſolve to do any thing beſides of the leaſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, unleſs his <hi>wizards</hi> tell him it is a good and a proſperous hour, to begin, and ſet upon ſuch an undertaking, and at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inſtant he hath his directions from them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſets upon the thing he undertakes, and not before.</p>
               <p>It is ſtrange to conſider what <hi>ignorance</hi> or <hi>deſpair</hi> in this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And therefore he ſaid in his diſtreſs unto his ſervants, 1 <hi>Sam. 28. 7. Seek me out one that hath a familiar ſpirit.</hi> The condition of <hi>Saul</hi> was at this time exceeding ſad, as appears by his complaint, v. 15. <hi>The Philiſtins make war againſt me, and God is departed from me, and anſwers me no more either by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, or Dreams, and what ſhall I do?</hi> I confeſs that the loſs of God is the greateſt
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:115803:133"/>
of all loſſes. For, as his <hi>favour</hi> to a believing Soul, in the want of every thing beſides, is <hi>enough, becauſe his loving kindnes is better than life it ſelf)</hi> Pſal. 63. 3. So, the <hi>gaining</hi> of every thing the world can afford with the <hi>loſs of Gods Countenance,</hi> makes <hi>profit loſs, a Chaire of State uneaſy,</hi> an heredita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, (and much more) a uſurped Scepter ſo unweildy, as that it cannot be managed with comfort.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Saul,</hi> a King, is ſo perplexed in his thoughts, when as Almighty God <hi>had taken his loving kindnes from him,</hi> that he asks the queſtion, what ſhall I do? Not what thou did'ſt (wretched <hi>Saul)</hi> againſt the ſtreame of thine own Conſcience, to ſeek unto thoſe whom thou had'ſt but of late condemned, and puniſhed, to take a courſe which thou knoweſt to be divelliſh. Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Saul,</hi> how couldſt thou hope to find God at thy Command, that wouldſt not be at His! How couldſt thou look that God ſhould regard thy voyce in trouble, that wouldſt not regard his in Peace? <hi>Saul</hi> had now forfetted Gods favour, and God takes the forfeture; and there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ore it was not to be wondred at, that he walked ſo irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, when he had put himſelf out of Gods Protection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="tcp:115803:134"/>
Thus before <hi>(Numb.</hi> 22.) when all help failed <hi>Moab,</hi> the Magician was ſought unto. If there be any one Project worſe than another, a wicked heart will finde that out; though it be a ſign of a moſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate cauſe, when Sathan is made either a mans Counſellor or Refuge.</p>
               <p>What men may do by the help of Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, and do it ſafely and without ſin, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves Commendation, not blame, nor Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But certainly to conclude of future events, is above Art or, Man; becauſe thoſe things Almighty God hath lockt up among his ſecrets, far above all reach, or ſearch. Nay, the moſt intelligent Spirits know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of future Events; or could thoſe evill Spirits truly foretell things to come no way pre-exiſtent, they could not without great danger and ſin be conſulted withall; for the evill of their Nature debarrs all the benefit that can come by their information; for they never do a man an apparent good one way, but they do him a Real miſchief another.</p>
               <p>The Devill (as we may conceive) knows things paſt, and as he animates and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages a man to theft by his ſuggeſtions, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, that he is poor, and muſt live, and therefore may ſteal; that if he cannot ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:115803:134"/>
himſelf by warrantable, he muſt live, and therefore may take other courſes. Now that Devill which courts a man to Theft, can certainly tell what he ſteales, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can diſcover goods ſtol'n: wherein the Devill makes a double advantage unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; firſt, in making the Thief his own, and ſecondly, the other, who leaves God, and repaires to him in his inſtruments for a diſcovery of goods thus ſtoln.</p>
               <p>Now for a <hi>Mahometan</hi> who lives in the dark to conſult <hi>Southſayers,</hi> and <hi>Wizards,</hi> it is no great marvell, becauſe his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of God puts him upon thoſe mad ſhifts and conceits to have recourſe unto Sathan: But for ſuch as profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, who live under that cleer light, which ſtrictly forbids all ſuch courſes; for theſe in their loſſes to repaire unto cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning men, and women (as they call them) who cannot poſſibly help them, but by ſome ſecret <hi>compact with the Devill,</hi> is certainly a very grievous ſin, an undertaking moſt horribly impious. So then, they whoſoever they be who to find out their ſtoll'n goods, hazard the loſs of their Souls, however they ſpeed ſhall gain nothing by that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry.</p>
               <p>Yet this hath been a ſin very ancient in
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:115803:135"/>
the world, and undertaken for more ends, than I have named. When</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of their Phyſicians, Diſeaſes, Cures. When they begin their year. How they meaſure their time, &amp;c.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HEre are thoſe which pretend unto much skill in Phyſick, though (for ought I could ever there obſerve) the people make but little uſe of them, they fearing more <hi>Medicum quam Morbum;</hi> and therefore do believe the Phyſician to be the more dangerous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>
               <p>The common diſeaſes of that Countrey are <hi>bloody fluxes,</hi> with others that come not to blood, hot-<hi>Feavers, Calentures,</hi> which ceiſe on and fire the head and brain, more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts. Theſe, many times put our men at Sea into very high diſtempers, eſpecially while they are under the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> which makes the poor creatures viſited with them, ſometimes to conceit the ſpacious Sea and Waves therein to be great <hi>Fields</hi> full of <hi>Heycocks;</hi> and if they were not ſometimes happily prevented, would leap over-board to tumble in them.</p>
               <p>For ordinary <hi>Agues,</hi> ſuch as are ſo common among us, and for thoſe two torments rather
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:115803:136"/>
than diſeaſes (when they are ſelt in extremity) the <hi>Gout</hi> and the <hi>Stone,</hi> they have the happineſs to be ignorant of them.</p>
               <p>But ſometimes they are viſited with an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation, or an extreme burning,</hi> ſuch as is ſpoken of, <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. 22. or rather with a moſt grievous <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> which on a ſudden ſweeps away many thouſands when it comes into great Populous Cities. This <hi>Peſtilence</hi> makes the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes of men there which are viſited with it, like an houſe, which on a ſudden is covered all over wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h fire at once. The City <hi>Amadavar</hi> (at our being there with the <hi>King)</hi> was viſited with this Peſtilence, in the Month of <hi>May,</hi> and our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily was not exempted from that moſt incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable viſitation, for within the ſpace of nine dayes, ſeven perſons that were <hi>Engliſh</hi> of our family were taken away by it, and none of thoſe which dyed lay ſick above twenty houres, and the major part well, and ſick, and dead in twelve houres. As our <hi>Surgeon</hi> (who was there all the Phyſician we had) and he led the way, falling, ſick at <hi>Mid-day,</hi> and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Mid-night</hi> dead. And there were three more that followed him, one immediatly after the other, who made as much haſt to the grave as he had done, and the reſt went after them; within that ſpace of time (I named before.) And (as before I obſerved) all thoſe that died in our family, of this peſtilence, had their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:115803:136"/>
ſet all on fire by it, ſo ſoon as they were firſt viſited; and when they were dying, and dead, broad ſpots of a black and blew colour appeared on their breſts; and their fleſh was made ſo extreme hot by their moſt high diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that we who ſurvived, could ſcarce endure to keep our hands upon it.</p>
               <p>It was a moſt ſad time, a <hi>ſiery trial</hi> indeed. But ſuch is the goodnes of Almighty God, that he makes the miſeries of men here, <hi>Aut tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biles, aut breves,</hi> either ſufferable, or ſhort; ſo that if the thing impoſed be extreme heavy to be born, it continues not long, as this moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous viſitation; moſt violent for the time, like a mighty ſtorm, and then blown away. For here the mercy of God ſuddenly <hi>ſtept in, betwixt the living and the dead;</hi> ſo that not only in our family, but alſo in that great City, the Plague was ſtayed.</p>
               <p>All our <hi>family</hi> [my Lord Ambaſſadour only excepted] were viſited with this ſickneſs; and we all, who through Gods help and goodnes outlived it, had many great bliſters, fild with a thick yellow watry ſubſtance, that aroſe upon many parts of our bodyes, which when they brake, did even <hi>burn</hi> and <hi>corrode</hi> our skins, as it ran down upon them.</p>
               <p>For my part, I had a <hi>Calenture</hi> before at <hi>Mandoa,</hi> which brought me even into the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Jawes of Death,</hi> from whence it pleaſed
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:115803:137"/>
God then to reſcue and deliver me, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thouſands and millions of mercies more received from him, hath, and ſhall for ever give me cauſe <hi>to ſpeak good of his Name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are very few Engliſh which come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but have ſome violent ſicknes, which if they eſcape, and live temperately, they uſually enjoy very much health afterward. But death made many breaches into my Lord <hi>Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> family, for of <hi>four and twenty</hi> wayters, beſides his Secretary and my ſelf, there was not above the fourth man returned home. And he himſelf by violent Fluxes, was twice brought even to the very brink of the Grave.</p>
               <p>The Natives of <hi>Eaſt India,</hi> in all their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hot diſeaſes, make very little uſe of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, unleſs in be to bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>That foul diſeaſe [a moſt into conſequence of filthy incontinency] is too common in thoſe hot climates, where the people that have it are much more affected with the trouble it brings, than with the ſin or ſhame thereof.

               <p>The people in <hi>Eaſt India</hi> live up to our greateſt ages; but without all queſtion they have more old people than we; a thing not to be wondred at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if we conſider the great Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of that people in general in their eating and drinking.</p>
               <p>But to proceed. The <hi>Hindooes</hi> or <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> there begin their year the firſt day of <hi>March.</hi> The <hi>Mahometans</hi> begin theirs, the tenth, at the very inſtant as the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> there gheſs that the Sun enters into <hi>Aries,</hi> their <hi>year</hi> as ours is divided into twelve <hi>Months,</hi> or rather into thirteen <hi>Moons,</hi> for according to them they make many payments. They di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh their time in a much different manner from us, dividing the day into four, and the night into as many parts, which they call <hi>Pores;</hi> which again they ſubdivide each of them into eight parts, which they call <hi>Grees;</hi> meaſured ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115803:138"/>
to the ancient cuſtome, by water drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping out of one veſſell into another, by which there alwayes ſtands a man appointed for that ſervice, to turn that veſſell up again when it is all dropped out, and then to ſtrike with an hammer (upon the brim of a concave peece of Metal, like the inner part of a large platter, hanging by the brim on a wire) the number of thoſe <hi>Pores,</hi> and <hi>Grees</hi> as they paſs. It hath a deep ſound, and may be heard very far; but theſe are not common amongſt them. Neither have they any Clocks, or Sun-Dials to ſhew them fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how their time paſſeth.</p>
               <p>We lived there ſome part of our time a little within, or under the <hi>Tropick of Cancer,</hi> and then the Sun was our <hi>Zenith,</hi> or Verticle at noon day directly over our heads, at his return to his Northern bounds. (of which I have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſomething before) The Sun-riſing there, was about ſix houres in the Morning before its appearing here, ſo that it is twelve of the clock with them, when it is but ſix with us.

               <p>For the <hi>Temperance</hi> of very many, by far the greateſt part of the <hi>Mahometans</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> it is ſuch, as that they will rather chooſe to dye, like the <hi>Mother</hi> and her <hi>ſeven Sons</hi> mentioned in the ſecond of <hi>Machabees</hi> and ſeventh Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then eat or drink any thing their Law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidds them.

not tranſgreſs in taking too much of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; hating <hi>Gluttony</hi> and eſteeming <hi>drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> as indeed it is, another <hi>Madnes,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have but one word in their language, (though it be very Copious) and that word is <hi>Moſt,</hi> for a <hi>drunkard,</hi> and a <hi>mad-man.</hi> Which ſhewes their hatred of drunken diſtempers; for none of the people there are at any time ſeen drunk, (though they might find liquor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to do it, but the very offal and dreggs of that people, and theſe rarely, or very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>And here I ſhall inſert another moſt heedfull particular to my preſent purpoſe, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a moſt high commendation to be given unto that people in general, how poor and mean ſoever they be; and that is, the great exemplary care they manifeſt in their <hi>piety</hi> to their <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> that notwithſtanding they ſerve for very little (as I obſerved before) but five ſhillings a <hi>Moon</hi> for their whole livelyhood and ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence; yet if their Parents be in want, they will impart at the leaſt half of that little to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their neceſſities, chooſing rather to want themſelves, then that their Parents ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer need.</p>
               <p>I would have this read, and read over again by many who call themſelves Chriſtians, yet moſt ſhamefully neglect thoſe loynes from which they fell, looking upon their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:115803:140"/>
if they be in need, either with a ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, or a grudging eye. Whence we have this ſaying amongſt us (which that people would ſpit at) that one Father and Mother will better provide for ten helpleſs Children, then ſo many Children make fitting proviſion for one poor Father and Mother, as if they were not the Sons and Daughters of men, but rather Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the <hi>Horſeleeches,</hi> who are ever Crying, <hi>Give, give,</hi> never returning ought, or any thing proportionable to anſwer that love and care they have received from their Parents.</p>
               <p>It is the Precept of the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 2. (which is often repeated before in the ſacred ſtorie) <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother, which is the firſt Commandement with promiſe,</hi> with promiſe of a bleſſing unto all thoſe who perform that duty as they ought. Now this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring of Parents muſt be expreſſed by all wayes that manifeſt Childrens duty, not only in an outward reſpect and diſtance, but alſo in a free releaſe of them, if Children be able, and Parents ſtand in need.</p>
               <p>'Tis well obſerved, that when <hi>Noah</hi> once <hi>ſurprized by wine, had layd open his Nakednes in his Tent,</hi> Gen. 9. and by one houres drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had diſcovered that, which more then ſix hundred years ſobriety had modeſtly concealed, (for drunkennes doth both make imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and prefents them thus made to others
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:115803:140"/>
eyes) that his Sons <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japhet,</hi> out of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and reſpect unto their Father, took a garment and went backward, that they might cover, not behold their Fathers nakednes. Which act of Duty and reſpect unto their Father, was large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repayed unto them in their poſterity; whereas <hi>Cham</hi> their brother for his undutifulnes in this caſe, beares his Fathers curſe, and lives under it, and is plagued in his children. We may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it as a rule, that there have not been any very neglectfull of, or rebelliouſly undutifull unto their Parents, that have proſpered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and ſeed. <hi>Abſolon</hi> lifts up his hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Father <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>his head is after lifted up, and hanged in an Oke, where he dyed miſerably.</hi> 2 Sam. 18. I could inſtance further, if it were the buſines of this diſcourſe. But I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to the place from whence I am di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed, and muſt ſay</p>
               <p>Further for this people, (which is not the leaſt commendation of them) they are in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral a Nation that do never pride it in any new Faſhions; for as they are very civilly clad, ſo I am confident, that they keep to the very ſelfe ſame Faſhion, that their Anceſtors did weare, many hundred yeares agoe (as before I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved)</p>
               <p>And certainly if a man ſhould take his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney <hi>from the riſing of the Sun, to the going down of the ſame,</hi> he ſhould not find a people in all

the world ſo overrun with an <hi>Itch</hi> after a new faſhion, as the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> are, [of which likewiſe ſomething before.]</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Mahometans</hi> [who live much upon the labours of the <hi>Hindooes,</hi> keeping them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, becauſe they formerly conquered them] there are many of them Idle, and know better to eat than work, &amp; theſe are all for to <hi>morrow,</hi> a word very common in their mouths, and the word is <hi>Sub-ba,</hi> which ſignifies to <hi>morrow,</hi> and when that day comes, to <hi>morrow,</hi> and ſo ſtill to <hi>morrow,</hi> they will ſet down upon their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to <hi>morrow,</hi> will do any thing you would have them to do to <hi>morrow,</hi> they will beſtow any thing upon you <hi>Sub-ba,</hi> to morrow. <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitis divites,</hi> moſt rich in promiſes, in perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances not ſo.

               <p>Which appeares much in their <hi>Juſtnes</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted unto thoſe that trade with them; for if a man will put it unto their conſciences to ſell the Commodity he deſires to buy at as low a rate as he can afford it, they will deal ſquarely, and honeſtly with him; but if in thoſe bargainings a man offer them much leſs than their ſet price,

               <p>I never obſerve that place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18. where <hi>Abimelech</hi> reprooves <hi>Sarah,</hi> but methinks it is ſad for <hi>Sarah, the wife of Abraham, of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham the Father of the Faithfull,</hi> to do that for which ſhe might be reprooved by <hi>Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech.</hi> It was a ſhamefull reproof indeed for a woman of her ſort to be taught her duty, and upbraided with her faults by an Heathen man.

               <p>Yet becauſe it conteins much in it very <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> to <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> and <hi>ſoothes</hi> up, and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies</hi> exceedingly with corrupt <hi>nature,</hi> it want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no followers preſently to embrace, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert it; ſo that in a little time, like a <hi>Gangrene,</hi> it ſpred it ſelfe into many parts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and ſince that hath enlarged it ſelfe like Hell; ſo that, at this preſent day it hath more that <hi>profeſs</hi> it in the world, then thoſe which profeſs <hi>Chriſtani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> if we take in all collectively that doe but beare the Names of Chriſtians, the world over.</p>
               <p>The poore people, that are ſo much abuſed by the ſtrong deluſions of that great <hi>Impoſtor,</hi> ſay for themſelves thus, that God hath ſent three great <hi>prophets</hi> into the world, firſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> and after him <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and then <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and further adde that when <hi>Chriſt</hi> left the world hee promiſed to ſend a <hi>Comforter</hi> into it, and that <hi>Comforter</hi> w <hi>Mahomet,</hi>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:115803:145"/>
and therefore they cloſe with him.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not neede amongſt men profeſſing Chriſtianity to write any thing in anſwer to thoſe their frantick aſſertions, neither will Imake it my buſineſs to enlarge my ſelfe in the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Mahometan Religion,</hi> becauſe that hath beene done by ſo many hands already; only this I wil ſay of it, &amp; not much more, that it hath <hi>Will-worſhip</hi> for its <hi>Foundation, Fables</hi> and <hi>Lyes</hi> for its <hi>ſupport,</hi> and a groundleſs <hi>preſumption</hi> for its <hi>ſuper-ſtructure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For its <hi>Foundation,</hi> firſt, abundance of <hi>will-worſhip,</hi> manifeſted in many outward perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, which are not hard to be performed, becauſe the depraved will of man, is ready preſt and bent to performe things of that kind with readineſs, Cheerfullneſs, and delight. <hi>The works of your Father the Devil you will doe,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, of the obſtinate <hi>Jews,</hi> doe them, be they never ſo hard, with content and willingneſs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>Mahometan Religion</hi> hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of <hi>ſtrange, monſtrous, fables</hi> and <hi>Lyes</hi> for its ſupport, their <hi>Alcoran</hi> (for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it) being a fardle of fooliſh impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, fit to be received by none but <hi>fooles,</hi> and <hi>mad-men;</hi> for they can gaine no more credit with thoſe that are judicious, then what is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ryming ſtory of that antient Knight Errant, <hi>Bevis</hi> of <hi>Southampton;</hi> or in the Poems of <hi>Orlando</hi> the furious, where may be found ſome

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, it hath a groundleſs <hi>preſumption</hi> for its ſuperſtructure, which preſumption drawes that miſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Yet it cannot bee denied, but that there are ſome things in the precepts which <hi>Mahomet</hi> hath preſcribed to be received and obſerved by his followers, that are good; layd downe in eight commandements which are theſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>that God is a great God, and the only God, and Mahomet is the Prophet of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Second, <hi>that Children muſt obey their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and doe nothing to diſpleaſe them either in word or deed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Third, <hi>that every one muſt doe to another that, and only that which he would have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourth, <hi>that every man five times every day muſt repaire to the Moſquit or Church, to pray there, or whereſoever hee is, hee muſt pray e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day ſo often, if not in the Church, then elſewhere.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:115803:146"/>
Fift, <hi>that one whole moone in every yeare, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man, come to yeares of diſcretion, muſt ſpend the whole day, twixt the riſing, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Sunne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> in faſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixt, <hi>that every one out of his ſtore, muſt give unto the poore liberally, freely, and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seventh, <hi>that every one (except thoſe Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which renounce marriage) muſt marry, to increaſe and multiply the Sect, and Religion of Mahomet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Eight, <hi>that no man muſt kill, or ſhed blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now much in theſe commandements agrees with <hi>the word of truth;</hi> and we neede not wonder at it, when we conſider, that even the Devil himſelfe (as we may obſerve in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel) hath ſometimes had a Scripture in his mouth. So have <hi>Hereticks,</hi> and ſo did <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> and his aſſiſtants mix ſome Scripture in their <hi>Alcoran,</hi> to put a fairer gloſs upon their irreligion. But what Scriptures they all urge, are for the moſt part, if not ever, wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by their mayming, or perverting, or miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of them. Thus the Devill quotes a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Mat 4. 6. but one part is left out, and the reſt miſſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> applied. Thoſe therefore who wreſt or mangle ſcripture to ſerve their owne turne, we may ſee from whoſe ſchoole they have it. Thus <hi>Mahomet</hi> cites ſcripture to doe more
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:115803:147"/>
miſchiefe by it; let no man content himſelfe, and think all is well, becauſe he can ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſpeak good words, have a ſcripture in his mouth; when he conſiders that <hi>Hereticks, Hypocrits</hi> doe ſo, that <hi>Mahomet,</hi> nay <hi>Satan</hi> himſelfe hath done as much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Satan can transform himſelfe into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light,</hi> and ſeeme holy to doe miſchiefe. Thus <hi>Simeon,</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> (out of conſcience pretended) <hi>could not give their Siſter to an uncircumciſed man.</hi> Gen. 34. there was <hi>God</hi> in their mouthes, but <hi>Satan</hi> in their hearts, they hide their <hi>Cruelty</hi> with <hi>Craft,</hi> and cover their <hi>Craft</hi> with <hi>Religion.</hi> Of all miſchiefes, thoſe that ſmile moſt, are moſt deadly. the uglyeſt and vileſt of all projects well make uſe of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> as a Foyle, to ſet them off; Poyſoned <hi>Pills</hi> can finde <hi>Gold</hi> to <hi>cover</hi> them; becauſe the <hi>worſe</hi> that any thing is, the better <hi>ſhew</hi> it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to make.</p>
               <p>But to proceed; the <hi>Mahometan prieſts</hi> are called <hi>Moolaas</hi> who read ſome parcells out of their <hi>Alcoran,</hi> upon Frydays (which are their ſabboths, or days of reſt) unto the people aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in their <hi>Moſquit</hi> or Churches, and then fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deliver ſome precepts, which they gather out of it, unto their miſerably deluded hearers.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Moolaas</hi> are they which joyn thoſe of that Religion in marriage; and theſe imploy
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:115803:147"/>
much of their time as Scriveners to doe buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for others; or to teach their yong Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to write and reade their language in writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hand, for (as before) they have no Printing. Thoſe <hi>Moolaas</hi> are more diſtinguiſhed from the reſt of the <hi>Mahometans</hi> by their <hi>Beards</hi> (which they weare long) then by any other of their <hi>habits.</hi> Their calling gaines, and gives them very much reverence and eſteeme amongſt the People; as another ſort of <hi>prieſts</hi> there have, of an high <hi>order</hi> or ranke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which live much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired; but when they appeare openly are moſt highly reverenced; they are called <hi>Seayds</hi> who derive themſelves from <hi>Mahomet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Mahometans</hi> have faire Churches which (as before) are called <hi>Moſquits;</hi> their Churches are built of Marble or Courſer ſtone, the broad ſide towards the <hi>Weſt</hi> is made up cloſe like a firme wall, and ſo are both ends, in which there are no lights; the other broad ſide towards the <hi>Eaſt</hi> is erected upon <hi>Pillars</hi> (where a man may take notice of excellent workemanſhip both in vaults, and arches) the ſpaces betwixt them pillars ſtand open. Their Churches are built long and narrow, ſtanding <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South</hi> which way they lay up the bodies of their dead, but none of them within their Churches.</p>
               <p>At the four Corners of their <hi>Moſquits</hi> which

                  </gap>e are high and round, but ſmall Turrets, which are made open with lights every way, wherein a man may be eaſily ſeene, and heard; their devout <hi>Moolaas five times every day</hi> aſcend unto the tops of thoſe high <hi>Turrets,</hi> whence they proclaim, as loudly as they can poſſibly ſpeake, their Prophet <hi>Mahomet,</hi> thus in Arabian, <hi>La alla illa alla, Mahomet Reſul-alla</hi> that is, he re is no God but one God, and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet the meſſenger from God,</hi> That voyce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Bells, (which they uſe not in their Churches) puts the moſt devout in minde of the houres of their <hi>devotion,</hi> thoſe <hi>Prieſts</hi> being exceedingly zealous to promote the cauſe, and to keep up the honour of their <hi>Mahomet,</hi> as the men of <hi>Epheſus</hi> ſometime were, when they feared that the credit of their baggage <hi>Diana</hi> was like to be called into queſtion, they took up a <hi>Cry which continued for the ſpace of two houres,</hi> Crying out with one voyce, <hi>greaet is Diana of the Epheſians</hi> Act. 19. 24.</p>
               <p>When a mans Religion is right, he ought to be very zealous in the maintenance of it, very fearefull of the hazard, or loſs thereof. And therefore if theſe <hi>Mahometans,</hi> or thoſe men of <hi>Epheſus</hi> had had truth on their ſide, they would both have deſerved much commendation for what they did. And ſo <hi>Micha</hi> too who thus
<pb facs="tcp:115803:148"/>
complained when he had loſt his jmages, Judg. 18. 24. <hi>they have ſtol'n away my Gods, and what have I more?</hi> I confeſs that the loſs of God is the greateſt of all loſſes, but thoſe were proper Gods which <hi>Micha</hi> there bewayled, that would be ſtol'n, that could not ſave themſelves; who if the fire ſpare them, ruſt or rottenneſs, or time will conſume them. But thoſe <hi>Mahometans</hi> though they doe not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure either <hi>Idoles</hi> or <hi>Images,</hi> in their houſes, or Churches, yet are they very forward to cry up their irreligion and to ſhew much zeale for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zeale,</hi> is derived from a word that ſignifies to burne, it is a compound made up of many affections, as of <hi>griefe, joy, love, anger,</hi> well tempered together, and when it is ſo, it hath its due commendation both of God and man; and <hi>curſed is he that goes about to extinguiſh that holy fire,</hi> that holy fire (I ſay) which hath <hi>light</hi> in it as well as <hi>Heat,</hi> and heate as well as light. The truth of <hi>Zeale</hi> may be further diſcovered (of zeale that is good) if we confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der firſt the <hi>Roote</hi> from which it ſprings, and thats the <hi>knowledg</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of God; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Rule</hi> by which it is carryed on, and acts, and that's the <hi>word,</hi> and will of God, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>end</hi> it aymes at, and intends, and that's the <hi>honour</hi> and glory of God; and <hi>zeale</hi> thus
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:115803:149"/>
ordered cannot be too violent: but when for want of theſe it becomes irregular, and ſhews it ſelfe over much in bad cauſes (ſuch as before were nam'd) it is, <hi>Curſus celerrimus, ſed prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter viam,</hi> a ſwift violent motion but quite out of the way.</p>
               <p>And if it be good to be zealous in a good cauſe, then it is better to be zealous in the beſt: and the beſt cauſe to ſhew zeale in, is the cauſe of God, <hi>Pro Aris &amp; Focis</hi> was the old good Proverb; firſt to ſtand up for <hi>Gods rights,</hi> and afterward for <hi>our owne:</hi> and to believe that that <hi>vnum neceſſarium,</hi> which our <hi>Saviour</hi> commends unto us, Lu. 10, 42. is that one thing <hi>principally and eſpecially neceſſary,</hi> though the Devill, and our owne corruption will tell us, (if we will believe them) that there is nothing more needleſs. When <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> came to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and ſpake unto him about <hi>ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing unto the Lord their God, Pharaoh</hi> replyes, <hi>yee are idle, yee are idle, therefore yee ſay let us goe and ſacrifice unto the Lord,</hi> Ex. 5. 17. the ſame Devill that there ſpake in <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> ſpeaks in all ignorant and prophane people, who call <hi>Religion</hi> idleneſs and <hi>hypocriſie;</hi> a <hi>ſtrict</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven walking with God, <hi>ſingularity</hi> or a doing more then God requires us to perform.</p>

               <p>Happly the rather, becauſe every one there hath liberty to profeſs his owne Religion freely and if he pleaſe may argue againſt theirs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out feare of an <hi>inquiſition,</hi> as <hi>Tom Coryat</hi> did at another time with a <hi>Moolaa,</hi> and the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which of theſe two was the <hi>Muſſleman</hi> or true <hi>Believer,</hi> after much heate on both ſides, <hi>Tom Coryat</hi> thus diſtinguiſhed, that <hi>himſelfe</hi> was the <hi>Orthodox Muſſleman</hi> or true true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, the <hi>Moola</hi> the <hi>pſeudo Muſſleman</hi> or falſe true believers; which diſtinction, if I had not thought it would have made my Reader ſmile had been here omitted.</p>

               <p>Certainly <hi>Will-worſhip</hi> is a very eaſy duty, and if Almighty God would be as much pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, as man is, ſo much of that ſervice would not be quite loſt: But in thoſe ſervices wherein God is highly concern'd to reſt in the performance of any <hi>duty,</hi> when tis done, or any other way to <hi>fayle</hi> in the <hi>manner</hi> of doing it, makes thoſe ſervices which ſome may e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme <hi>holy,</hi> no better then <hi>Sins; Prayers,</hi> an <hi>Abomination:</hi> there being a vaſt difference twixt <hi>ſaying of prayers, and praying of prayers;</hi> twixt the ſervice of the <hi>head,</hi> and that of the <hi>heart; prayer,</hi> and <hi>prayer</hi> (heedefull circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances conſidered) differing as much as <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> and <hi>Superſtition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for the carriage of that people in their devotions, before they goe into their <hi>Churches</hi> they <hi>waſh their feet,</hi> and entring into them put off their <hi>ſhooes.</hi> As they begin their devotions they ſtop their <hi>eares,</hi> and fix their <hi>eyes,</hi> that nothing may divert their thoughts, then in a ſoft and ſtill voyce they utter their <hi>prayers,</hi> wherein are many words moſt ſignificantly expreſſing the <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> and <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> and <hi>Eternity,</hi> and other <hi>Attributes</hi> of God.

               <p>And here the thing being rightly and ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidered, it is a very great ſhame that a <hi>Mahometan</hi> ſhould pray five times every day, that <hi>Paganes</hi> and <hi>Heathens</hi> ſhould be very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in their devotions, and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (who only can hope for good anſwers in Prayer) ſo negligent in that <hi>great prevailing duty.</hi> For a <hi>Mahometan</hi> to pray <hi>five times</hi> every day, what diverſions ſoever he hath to hinder him, and for a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to let any thing interrupt his devotion; for a <hi>Mahometan</hi> to pray five times a day, and for one that is called a Chriſtian not

               </p>
               <p>But this will admit leſs cauſe of wonder if wee conſider how that many bearing the Names of Chriſtians cannot pray at all, thoſe I meane which are prophane and filthy, and who live as if there were no God to hear, or to <hi>judg,</hi> and no <hi>Hell</hi> to <hi>puniſh.</hi> Such as theſe can but <hi>babble,</hi> they cannot pray, for they <hi>blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme</hi> the Name of God, while they may thinke they <hi>adore it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall adde here a ſhort ſtorie, It happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that I once having ſome diſcourſe with a <hi>Mahometan</hi> of good quality, and ſpeaking with him about his <hi>frequent praying</hi> I told him that if himſelfe, and others of his profeſſion who did believe it as a duty to pray ſo often, could <hi>conclude</hi> their Petitions in the <hi>Name of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> they might finde much comfort in thoſe their <hi>frequent performances,</hi> in that great <hi>duty:</hi> He anſwered, that I needed not to trouble my ſelfe with that, for they found as great comfort as they could deſire in what they did. And preſently he would needs inferr this Relation.</p>
               <p>There was (ſaid hee) a moſt devout <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleman</hi> who had his habitation in a great City where <hi>Mahomet</hi> was zealouſly profeſſed, and that man for many yeares together ſpent his
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:115803:153"/>
whole day in the <hi>Moſquit,</hi> or Church, in the mean time, he minding not the world at all, became ſo poor that he had nothing left to buy bread for his family, yet notwithſtanding his poor condition he was reſolved ſtill to ply his devotions, and in a morning (when he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that there was nothing at all left for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſubſiſtence of himſelfe and houſhould) tooke a ſolemne leave of his wife and Children reſolving for his part to goe and <hi>pray</hi> and <hi>dye</hi> in the <hi>Moſquit,</hi> leaving his family (if no relief came) to famiſh at home. But that very day he put on this reſolution, there came to his houſe in his abſence a very <hi>beautifull young man</hi> (as he appeared to be) who brought and gave unto his <hi>wife</hi> a very good quantity of <hi>Gold</hi> bound up in a white <hi>Napkin,</hi> telling her, that God had now remembred her husband, and ſent him his <hi>pay</hi> for his conſtant paines taken in his <hi>devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> withall charging her not to ſend for her husband, for though he had taken ſuch a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne leave of her that morning, yet he would come home to her againe that night, and ſo he departed from her. The woman preſently bought in ſome neceſſaryes for her houſe (for they had eaten up all before) and further made ſome good proviſion for her husband againſt his coming home in the evening, (for ſo he did) and finding all his family very cherefull and merry, his Wife preſently told him, that there had been
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:115803:153"/>
ſuch a one there (as before deſcribed) and left ſo much gold behinde him, with that fore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned meſſage delivered with it. Her husband preſently replyed that it was the <hi>Angel Gabriel</hi> ſent from God, (for the <hi>Mahometans</hi> ſpeak much of that <hi>Angel)</hi> and he further added that <hi>himſelfe</hi> had <hi>nothing</hi> to bring home unto her but a little <hi>grett,</hi> or <hi>ſand</hi> which he tooke up in his way homeward, and bound it in his gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, which he preſently opening to ſhew her, it was all turn'd into <hi>pretious</hi> ſtones, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted unto a very great value in Money.

               <p>The <hi>Mahometans</hi> ſay, that they have the Bookes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but they have very much cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted that ſtory, in aſcribing that to <hi>Iſhmael</hi> which is ſaid of <hi>Iſaac</hi> Gen: 22. as if <hi>Iſhmael</hi> ſhould have beene ſacrificed, not <hi>Iſaac.</hi> (of which more afterward) They ſay that they have the Booke of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes; and ſome Writings of <hi>Solomon,</hi> with other parcels of the old <hi>Teſtament;</hi> which, if ſo, I believe a

made much to vary from their original.</p>
               <p>They ſpeak very much in the Honour of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> whom they call <hi>Mooſa Calim-Alla; Moſes</hi> the publiſher of the minde of God.

               <p>So of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> whom they call <hi>Iſmal,</hi> the Sacrifice of God. So of <hi>Iacob<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>And, by the way, many of the <hi>Mahometans</hi> there are called by the names of <hi>Mooſa,</hi> or <hi>Ibrahim,</hi> or <hi>Iſmal,</hi> or <hi>Acob<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>But I'll return again to that people that I may acquaint my reader with one thing of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall obſervation and tis this: That there is not one among the Mahometans (of any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding) which at any time mentions the name of our bleſſed <hi>Saviour</hi> called there <hi>Hazare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For they ſay of <hi>Chriſt</hi> that he was a good man and a juſt, that he <hi>lived without ſin,</hi> that he did greater miracles than ever any before or ſince him nay further they call him <hi>Rha-how-Alla,</hi> the <hi>breath of God,</hi> but how he ſhould be the Son of God, cannot conceive, and therefore cannot believe.</p>
               <p>Perhaps the <hi>Socinians</hi> firſt tooke that their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion from theſe, which bids them to have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing they receive as truth, to be cleered up unto them by the ſtrength of Reaſon, as if there were no need of the exerciſe of faith.</p>
               <p>And truly (I muſt needs confeſs) that to beleeve <hi>the Incarnation of the Son of God,</hi> is one of the hardeſt and greateſt taskes for Faith to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter withall that God ſhould be <hi>made a Man,</hi> that this Man Chriſt ſhould be born of a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, that <hi>Life</hi> ſhould ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Theſe are Articles of our Faith; and we are not chriſtians if we believe them not.</p>
               <p>It may ſeem very ſtrange therefore, that the <hi>Mahometans</hi> (who underſtand themſelves better) ſhould have ſuch a very high eſteem of our <hi>Bleſſed Saviour Chriſt,</hi> and yet think us who profeſs our ſelves <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, or ſo uncleane, as that they will <hi>not eat with us,</hi> any thing that is of out <hi>dreſſing,</hi> nor yet of any thing that is dreſſed in our <hi>veſſels.</hi>

A man is naturally apt to think that God is with him while he proſpers though in evill. And tis obſerved of wicked men that they have <hi>enjoyed</hi> as <hi>much,</hi> nay more than their <hi>hearts could wiſh.</hi> The poſterity of <hi>Cain</hi> before the <hi>Flood,</hi> were <hi>the mighty men, the men of Name, the men of renown,</hi> the triumphing men in that old world, and ever ſince that ſpurious race have been the great <hi>ingroſſers</hi> of outward <hi>proſperity: behold,</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt, 73. 12) <hi>theſe are the ungodly that proſper in the world;</hi> But many of the mercyes they receive, if not all, come out of Gods <hi>left hand,</hi> not in <hi>love</hi> but <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> as the mutinous <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had <hi>Qvailes in the wilderneſs</hi> not to feed them ſo much, as to <hi>choake</hi> them; they being dealt withall herein much like as the Old <hi>Heathens</hi> dealt with their Sacrifices, firſt they fed them, and then they crownd them, and then they kild them, the ſubſtance of which I finde thus rendred; <hi>Thus Beaſts for ſacrifice they feed, Firſt they are crown'd, and then they bleed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus God advanced and lifted up <hi>Pharaoh</hi> not in Mercy, but Diſpleaſure, that he might firſt ſhew his Judgments before him; and then upon him. <hi>Thou haſt lifted me up and caſt me down,</hi> lifted me up very high, that my fall might be greater.</p>
               <p>It is moſt true, that nothing comes to paſs, neither can be done without the Knowledge
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:115803:159"/>
and Permiſſion of Almighty God; thus Good things are done by his Privity, Aſſiſtance and Approbation; things that are Evill, by his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, Permiſſion, but not Liking. The wicked are called the ſword of God. <hi>Pſ. 17. &amp;c.</hi> They do his will in executing his vengeance, ſo <hi>Babylon</hi> was called the Hammer, and <hi>Aſſyria</hi> the Rod of the Lord; But theſe Swords, and Hammers, and Rods when they have done the ſervice which was appointed for them to doe, are thrown into the fire, and meet with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Vengeance afterward, then they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly executed. They did the ſecret Will of God, in doing what they did; as no doubt but the Devill did in afflicting of <hi>Iob;</hi> in winnow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Peter;</hi> in buffetting of <hi>Paul;</hi> but his recompenſe for theſe and all other his works, is <hi>Chains under darkneſs</hi> and that for <hi>ever and ever.</hi> And thus <hi>Iudas</hi> did the will of God in betraying his innocent Maſter, the Son of God; and conſequently furthering the Redemption of Mankind, but his Reward was ſad for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; his End, Perdition.</p>
               <p>And therefore in all our undertakings, we muſt learn wiſely to diſtingviſh twixt God's <hi>appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> and <hi>permiting</hi> will, the firſt of theſe muſt limit us in all the things we ſet about, his ſignifyed, declared, approved will laid down in his Word; We may do the Will of God otherwiſe as it were againſt his Will; do the

will of God and have little thanks for our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in doing things which God permits but approves not,</p>
               <p>It muſt needs be therefore a ſin tranſcendent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked, for any who know God and his Truth, to entitle God and Religion unto acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are Evill, by fathering proſperous wickedneſs upon them, as if they did at all countenance ſuch things as Reli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

For <hi>Poligamy,</hi> or the having of more wives than one, <hi>Lamech</hi> a great Grand-child of <hi>Cain,</hi> was the firſt that brought it into the World, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 19. And it was firſt brought into the Church by <hi>Abraham:</hi> which act of his, as of others after him (good men in their generation) though it found <hi>permiſſion,</hi> never had <hi>approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> from Almighty God. And further, though under the times of the Law it found ſome <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence,</hi> yet ſince the Goſpel there hath been <hi>no ſuch cuſtom in any of the Churches of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in thoſe former times it was the charge of Almighty God to the Kings of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even before they were, <hi>that they ſhould not multiply wives,</hi> Deut. 17. 17. Yet <hi>Solomon</hi> (who in this diſcovered a great deal of folly, as in other things abundance of wiſdom) went further be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the bounds of that Law, than any other whom God owns in Scripture. The poor man in his later age loſt himſelf amongſt an houſe full of wives. For the ſtorie ſaith, <hi>that he loved many ſtrange women,</hi> 1 King. 11. 1. Every word had nothing but <hi>Bane</hi> in it. He loved women, many women, outlandiſh, idolatrous women, and theſe not onely had, but doted on, he being ſo taken with their perſons, that he humour'd them in their ſins. And if one wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the beginning undid all mankinde: it is no great marvel, if ſo many women did ſo much miſchief to one <hi>Solomon.</hi>

The <hi>Abiſſins</hi> ſay, that when the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Sheba</hi> came to viſite <hi>Solomon,</hi> that ſhe return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back with Childe by him, from whoſe iſſue (they further ſay) have come the race of their Kings ever ſince. But here I leave my Reader to believe in that as much, and no more than he pleaſe. This is clear in the ſacred ſtorie, that <hi>Solomon,</hi> though he had a thouſand wives and Concubines, he had but three Children, <hi>Reho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> his onely Son, and <hi>Taphal,</hi> and <hi>Baſmah</hi> his two Daughters, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 11. 15. an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſign that God never approved of his mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of wives, when by his bleſſing on the ſingle and holy wedlock of others, he hath mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied them in a very happy and numerous iſſue.</p>
               <p>In the old World when the <hi>Sons of God ſaw the Daughters of men that they were fair, they took wives of all that they liked,</hi> Gen. 6. 2. and theſe multiplied not Children ſo much as ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sampſon</hi> in the choiſe of his wife, had no other guides and counſellours but his own eyes. He went down to <hi>Timnah,</hi> and ſaw a Daughter of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and preſently he ſpeaks to his Father <hi>get her for me to wife, for ſhe pleaſeth me well,</hi> Judg. 14. 1. 2.

and be as unhappy in his choiſe as <hi>Sampſon</hi> was.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sampſon</hi> ſees a woman (and we will ſuppoſe her beautifull) and as ſoon as ever his eyes fix on her, he muſt <hi>preſently have her to wife.</hi> Wiſdom and Paſſion cannot dwell under one roof, for a man cannot love, nor deſire, nor mourn, nor grieve, nor rejoice over much and be wiſe, for when the heart is taken up very much with the later, there is no room left in it for the former.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Kings daughter is all glorious within, Pſal.</hi> 45. 13. and love, that reciprocally ſettles upon this inward beauty, muſt needs be laſting. <hi>Magnes amoris Amor.</hi> Love in this caſe is the Load-ſtone of love, ſo attractive that it draws love to it, and holds it faſt, when as he who marries a portion, or a face findes it often otherwiſe.

for beſides that day of general la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation at the end of their <hi>Ram-Jan,</hi> or Lent, (before mentioned) they houl and cry many whole dayes for their friends departed, immediately after they have left the world and after that time is paſſed over, many fooliſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, ſo long as they ſurvive, very often in the year, obſerve ſet dayes to renue their mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their deceaſed friends, and as a people without hope, bedew the graves of their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, as of other their near relations, with abundance of (ſeemingly) affectionate tears; as if they were like thoſe mourning women mentioned, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 17. who ſeemed to have tears at command, and therefore were hired to mourn and weep in their ſolemne lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

               <p>Which carriage of theirs deſerves nothing but cenſure and pity though if it be not Theatrical, we may much wonder at it, and ſay of it as it was ſaid of the mourning in the floor of <hi>Atad, Gen. 50. 11. that it is a grievous mourning,</hi> or
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:115803:169"/>
                  <hi>as the mourning of</hi> Hadadrimmon <hi>in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of</hi> Megiddon, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. 11. if we take thoſe lamentations onely in a literal ſence.</p>
               <p>But to ſpeak unto this as a Chriſtian; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Apoſtle, <hi>who forbids immoderate mourning for friends departed,</hi> 1 ſhef. 4. 13. imployes and allows of that mourning which is moderate.</p>
               <p>To behold a great Funeral, where there are abundance of mourning garments, and no weeping eyes, is not a good ſight; for a man to die as <hi>Jehojakim</hi> (a very bad Son of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent good Father) of whom it was ſadly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied, <hi>that he ſhould die without lamentation, non plangent eum, Eheu frater, they ſhall not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for him, ſaying, Ah my brother!</hi> his <hi>Aſhes</hi> ſhould not be moiſtned with one <hi>tear,</hi> and to be buried as <hi>Jehojakim was with the burial of an Aſſe,</hi> Jer. 2. 18, 19. is very ſad. And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it had been better for a man never to have been born, than to live undeſired and to die unlamented. For a man to run a long race through the world, and to leave no token of good behinde him but to be like an Arrow ſhot by a ſtrong arm up into the aire; wherein it flies a great circuit, yet immediately after it is fal'n, it cannot be diſcern'd that it was ever there, I may ſay of ſuch a one, that <hi>he was born out of due time,</hi> or rather that <hi>it had been good for him if he had not been born at all.</hi>

But now further concerning their places of Burial, many <hi>Mahometans</hi> of the greateſt qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie in their life time provide fair Sepulchres for themſelves and neareſts friends compaſſing with a firm wall, a good circuit of ground near ſome <hi>Tank,</hi> (before ſpoken of) about which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to Burie their dead, or elſe they cloſe in a place for this uſe, near ſprings of water, that may make pleaſant fountains, near which they erect little <hi>Miſquits,</hi> or Churches, &amp; near them <hi>Tombs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> built round, or four ſquare, or in ſix, or eight ſquares, with round vaults, or Canopies of ſtone over head, all which are excellently well wrought, and erected upon P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus to bury (as it ſhould ſeem) was an ancient cuſtom, for it is written of <hi>Manaſſeh King of</hi> Judah, <hi>that he was buried in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of his own houſe</hi> ſo of his Son <hi>Amon, that he was buried in that garden likewiſe, 2 King.</hi> 21. 18. and 26. verſes, thus I <hi>ſeph</hi> of <hi>Arima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thea</hi> had his Sepulchre in his garden, and it was well placed there, that when he was in the place of his greateſt delight, his meditations
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:115803:170"/>
might be ſeaſoned with the thoughts of his death.</p>
               <p>There are many goodly Monuments which are richly adorned; built (as before was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) to the memory of ſuch as they have eſteemed <hi>Paeres,</hi> or Saints (of whom they have a large <hi>Kalender)</hi> in which are Lamps conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually burning, attended by votaries, unto whom they allow Penſions for the maintaining of thoſe lights; and many (tranſported there with wilde devotion) dayly reſort to thoſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents, there to contemplate the happineſſe thoſe <hi>Paeres</hi> (as they imagine) now enjoy.</p>
               <p>And certainly of all the places that Empire affords, there are none that miniſter more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, than ſome of their burying places do, neither do they beſtow ſo much coſt, nor ſhew ſo much skill in <hi>Architecture</hi> in any other ſtructures, as in theſe.</p>

               <p>And truly if we conſider, and impartially read many <hi>Hyperbolical</hi> expreſſions engraven upon ſome Monuments, we may make a pauſe at the two firſt words, which are commonly theſe. <hi>Here lies,</hi> and write them thus, <hi>hear lies,</hi> and there make a ſtop, becauſe little, or nothing that follows hath any truth in it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though many great and rich men, have their bodies after death covered with ſtately <hi>Piles,</hi> which hold forth many, and high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of them, yet theſe cannot keep their

names from putrifying and rotting as much above ground, as their bodies do under it. <hi>The name of the wicked ſhall rot,</hi> Prov. 10. 17. <hi>His remembrance ſhall periſh from the earth, and he ſhall have no name in the ſtreet,</hi> Job 18. 17. or if their names ſurvive, and be remembred, they ſhall but continue their ſhame, as here lies, or there dwelt ſuch an oppreſſor, ſuch a cruel, or ſuch a covetous Muck-worm, or ſuch a filthy, or ſuch a prophane ungodly perſon, or ſuch an intemperate drunken ſot; whom many times ſuch an inſcription would fit, (if it were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten over their doors) as <hi>Diogenes</hi> ſometimes cauſed to be written upon the door of a like in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate perſon, who had written before that his houſe was to be ſold, under which that <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> wrote thus, I thought this houſe would ſurfet ſo long, that it would ſpue out its maſter, for <hi>God ſhall take ſuch away, and pluck them out of their dwelling places, and root them out of the land of the living,</hi> or as the Prophet <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>their dwellings ſhall caſt them out.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>The remembrance of</hi> Joſiah <hi>is like a compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the perfume that is made by the art of the Apothecary, ſweet in all mouths</hi> &amp;c. and ſo ſhall remain; when ſtately Monuments erected to preſerve the memorie of others, ſhall be ſo <hi>defaced,</hi> that it will not appear where they <hi>once were.</hi>

from hence (they ſay) that every man hath there an hollow bunch which women have not.</p>
               <p>The names they give to diſtinguiſh one man from another are many, and amongſt them theſe following are very common. As <hi>Juddo,</hi> or <hi>Midas,</hi> or <hi>Cooregee,</hi> or <hi>Hergee,</hi> and the like. <hi>Caſturia</hi> and <hi>Preſcotta,</hi> are Womens names amongſt them, but whither theſe, as thoſe names they call their men, or women by, are names of ſignification, or onely of ſound I know not.</p>
               <p>Thoſe <hi>Hindooes</hi> are a very laborious, and an induſtrious people: theſe are they which till and plant the ground, and breed the Cattle, theſe are they which make and ſell thoſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Manufactures, or the Cloath and ſtuffe which this Empire affords.</p>
               <p>This people marry into, and conſequently ſtill keep in their own <hi>Tribes, Sects, Occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and <hi>Profeſſions.</hi> For inſtance all <hi>Bramins</hi> (which are their Prieſts, the Sons of all which are Prieſts, likewiſe) are married to <hi>Bramins</hi> daughters, ſo a Merchants ſon marries a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants daughter, and ſo men of ſeveral trades marry to the ſame trade. Thus a <hi>Coolee,</hi> (who is a tiller of the ground) marries his ſon to a <hi>Colees</hi> daughter; and ſo in all other profeſſions they keep themſelves to their own Tribes and Trades, not mixing with any other, by which means they never advance themſelves higher than they were at firſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="320" facs="tcp:115803:176"/>
They take but one wife, and of her they are not ſo fearfull and jealous as the <hi>Mahometans</hi> are of their ſeveral wives and women, for they ſuffer their wives to go abroad whether they pleaſe. They are married very young, about ſix, or ſeven years old, their Parents making Matches for them, who lay hold of every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to beſtow their Children, becauſe confin'd to their own Tribes, they have not ſuch variety of choiſe as otherwiſe they might have<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when they attain to the age of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, or fourteen, or fifteen years at the moſt they bed together.</p>
               <p>Their marriages are ſolemnized (as thoſe of the <hi>Mahometans)</hi> with much company, and noiſe, but with this difference, that both the young couple ride openly on Horſ-back, and for the moſt part they are ſo little, that ſome go on their Horſe ſides to hold them up from falling. They are bedeckt, or ſtrewed all over their Cloathing, with the choiſe flowers of that Countrey, faſtned in order all about their Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>For their habits they differ very little from the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> but are very like them civil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clad, but many of their women were Rings on their Toes, and therefore go bare foot. They we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They have generally (I mean the women) the flaps, or tips of their ears boared when they are young, which holes daily extended and made wider, by things put and kept in them for that purpoſe, at laſt become ſo large, as that they will hold Rings (hollowed on the out-ſide like Pullies) for their fleſh to reſt in that are as broad in their circumference, ſome of them (I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A better agreement in death than that of <hi>Eteocles</hi> and <hi>Polynices,</hi> the two <hi>Theban</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of whom it is ſaid that they were ſuch deadly enemies while they were alive, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when both their bodies were burnt together in the ſame <hi>fiery Pile,</hi> the flame parted and would not mix in one, of which <hi>Statius</hi> thus:</p>

               <p>But thoſe, which before I named, agree ſo well in life, that they will not be divided by death, where their flames unite together. And although the Woman, who thus burns with her Husband, doth this voluntarily, not by any compulſion (for the love of every Widow there is not thus fired) and though the poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, who thus dies may return and live if ſhe pleaſe, even then when ſhe comes to the <hi>Pile,</hi>

               <p>Alas poor wretches! what a hard Maſter do they ſerve, who puts them upon ſuch unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſervices in the flower of their youth and ſtrength, thus to become their own executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; to burn their own <hi>bones</hi> when they are full of <hi>marrow,</hi> and to waſte their own <hi>breaſts,</hi> when they are full of <hi>milk.</hi> Now Almighty God requires no ſuch thing at his peoples hands, &amp; therefore it is by far the more ſtrange to conſider that the Devil ſhould have ſuch an abundance of ſervants in the World, and God ſo few.</p>

abundance) they would be very much troubled at it, and if they could not perſwade them to ſuffer thoſe poor Creatures to live, they would give them mony, or ſomething elſe to forbear that (as they conceived) cruelty.</p>
               <p>As for themſelves (I mean a very great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them) they will not deprive the moſt uſeleſſe, and moſt offenſive Creatures of life, not <hi>Snakes,</hi> and other venomous things that may kill them, ſaying, that it is their nature to do hurts, and they cannot help it, but as for themſelves they further ſay, that God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them reaſon to ſhun thoſe Creatur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And in order to this their conceit, the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> (who are the moſt tender hearted in this caſe of all that people) have <hi>Spittles</hi> (as they ſay) on purpoſe to recover lame birds &amp; beaſts.</p>
               <p>Some ground for this their tenderneſſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily proceeds from this conſideration; that they cannot give life to the meaneſt of the ſenſible Creatures, and therefore think that they may not take the lives of any of them: for the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt worm, which crawleth upon the face of the earth, <hi>tam vita vivit, quam Angelus,</hi> (as one of the ancients ſpeaks) live for the preſent as much as the Angels, and cannot be willing to part with that life, and therefore they imagine that it is moſt injurious by violence to take it.</p>
               <p>But (as I conceive) the moſt principal cauſe
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:115803:180"/>
why they thus forbear to take the lives of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Creatures, proceeds from their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto a precept given them by one of their principal, and moſt highly eſteemed Prophets and Law-givers they call <hi>Bremaw;</hi> others, they have in very high eſteem, and the name of one of them is <hi>Ram,</hi> of another <hi>Permiſſar.</hi> I am ignorant of the names of others, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that my Reader will not much care to know them.

                  <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill any living Creature what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it be, having life in the ſame, for thou art a Creature, and ſo is it, thou art indued with life, and ſo is it, thou ſhalt not therefore ſpil the life of any of thy fellow-Creatures that live.</hi>

                  <hi>Not to oppreſſe any, when they have power to do it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now all thoſe particulars are obſerved by them with much ſtrictneſſe; and ſome of them are very good, having the impreſſion of God upon them, but that ſcruple they make in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing the lives of the Creatures made for mens uſe, ſhews how that they have their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the dark, which makes them by reaſon of their blindneſſe to deny unto themſelves that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and <hi>Soveraignty</hi> which Almighty God hath given unto man <hi>over the beaſts of the field, the fowles of the Air, and the fiſhes of the Sea,</hi> appointed for his food, given unto him for his <hi>ſervice</hi> and <hi>ſuſtenance,</hi> to ſerve him, and to ſeed him, but not to make havock and ſpoil of them.</p>
               <p>However, the tenderneſſe of that people over inferiour Creatures ſhall one day riſe up in judgement againſt all thoſe, who make no

ſcruple at all in taking the lives, not of ſenſible Creatures, but men, not legally to ſatisfie good and known Laws, but violently to pleaſe their cruel and barbarous luſts.</p>
               <p>Hiſtories are fill'd with many inhumane, and ſtrange examples of this kinde. <hi>Valerius</hi> writes of <hi>Lucius Sylla</hi> (whoſe cruelty and thirſt after bloud, made him a Monſter of mankinde, a very Prodigy of Nature) that when he had cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſome thouſands of men to be put to death, or (more properly) to be murdered in one day, he preſently gave command that this monſtrous fact of his ſhould be recorded, leaſt the memory of ſo honourable an action (for ſo he call'd in) might be forgotten.</p>

Now touching this people, they are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant of God, as they ought to know him, and they have no learning amongſt them, but as much as enables them to write and to read what they have written and they having no inſight into the reaſons and cauſes of things (I mean the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Their ignorance in this, as in many many other things is much to be pitied: as the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and learning of many others, which (by their not improving of it) is to them as the letters which <hi>Uriah ſometimes carried againſt himſelf, it condemnes the bearer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But though the <hi>Hindoos,</hi> or <hi>Heathens</hi> there
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:115803:188"/>
have no learning, yet they want not opinions, for their divided hearts are there diſtracted into <hi>four-ſcore,</hi> and <hi>four</hi> ſeveral <hi>Sects,</hi> each differing from others, very much in opinion about their irreligion, which might fill a man, even full of wonder, that doth not conſider, how that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi> who is the author of diviſion, is the ſeducer of them all.</p>
               <p>Thoſe many Sects (as I conceive among them) conſiſt of people there of ſeveral trades, occupations, and conditions of life, which ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts of people (as before I obſerved) marry into their own tribes, and ſo unite and keep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether amongſt themſelves, that they had not much correſpondency with any other people.

The illiterare Prieſts of all that people for the generality of them are called <hi>Bramins,</hi> who derive themſelves from <hi>Bramon,</hi> whom (they ſay) was one of the firſt men that inhabited the World, and after the ſin of that firſt World brought the Flood: the race of that <hi>Bramon</hi> (whoſe very name they highly reverence) was continued in <hi>Bremaw,</hi> who (as they ſay) out-lived that deluge, and is honoured by them likewiſe as one of their great Prophets &amp; Law-givers.</p>
               <p>Thoſe <hi>Bramins</hi> (as I conceive) are they, which the ancient ſtories call <hi>Brachmanes,</hi> but with this difference, that thoſe <hi>Brachmanes</hi> were accounted learned men, for the learning of thoſe times wherein they lived: But thoſe <hi>Bramins</hi> are a very ſilly, ſottiſh, and an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſort of people, who are ſo inconſtant in their <hi>principles,</hi> as that they ſcarce know, what the particulars are which they hold, and maintain as truths.</p>
               <p>As anciently amongſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> their <hi>Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hond</hi> is <hi>hereditary,</hi> for all thoſe <hi>Bramins</hi> Sons are Prieſts, and they all take the daughters of <hi>Bramins</hi> to be their wives. (Of which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before.)</p>
               <p>They have little Churches they call <hi>Pagode,</hi> ſtanding near, or under their green Trees, built round; But as their ancient <hi>Brachmanes</hi> were ſaid not to èndure, theſe on the contrary have
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:115803:189"/>
Images in their <hi>Pagods</hi> made in monſtrous ſhapes, but for what end they have them, I know not.</p>
               <p>Now, from the manner of thoſe <hi>Heathens,</hi> which I believe hath been for many-many years retained in their Idolatrous worſhips. I conceive that the <hi>Jews</hi> long ago borrowed that unwarrantable cuſtom of worſhipping God in <hi>Groves,</hi> or <hi>under green Trees.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Both men and women before they go to their devotions (which are very frequently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) waſh their bodies, and keep off all their cloaths, but the covering of modeſty till they have done, led hereunto by a precept (as they ſay) commanded them to be perform'd by their Law-giver <hi>Bremaw,</hi> which requires them dayly <hi>to obſerve their times of devotion expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by their waſhings, and worſhippings, &amp; prayer to God; which muſt be all done with purity of hearts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is the manner of this people before they take their food to waſh their bodies, then (which I much obſerved while we lived in Tents) they make a little Circle upon the ground, which they ſeem to conſecrate, after which they ſit down within that Compaſſe, and eat what they have provided; and if any come within that Circle before they have ended their meal, they preſently quit the place, and leave their food behinde them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:115803:190"/>
That outward waſhing (as this people think) avails very much to their cleanſing from ſin, not unlike the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who were all for the out-ſide of Religion, and would not eat <hi>with unwaſhen hands,</hi> Marc. 7. 2. unleſſe they waſhed themſelves up to the Elbows, (as <hi>Theophi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

After they have thus waſhed, they throw pieces of Gold, or Silver (according to their devotion and ability) into that River, and ſo depart from it.</p>
               <p>Thus Reader thou haſt ſomewhat of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of this people in life. Now after death ſome of them talk of <hi>Elyzian fields</hi> (ſuch as the Poets dream'd of) to which their Souls muſt paſſe over a <hi>Stix,</hi> or <hi>Acheron,</hi> and there take new bodies. Others of them think that ere long the World will have an end, after which they ſhall live here again on a new earth. Some other wilde conceivings of this people follow afterward.</p>
               <p>Some <hi>Bramins</hi> have told me that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge one God, whom they deſcribe with a thouſand eyes, with a thouſand hands, and as many feet, that thereby they may expreſſe his

thoſe ſhort deſcriptions of <hi>Nagraiot,</hi> and <hi>Syba</hi> obſerved in my firſt ſection.</p>
               <p>Now there are a race of other Heathens (I named before) living amongſt thoſe <hi>Hindoos,</hi> which in many things differ very much from them, they are called <hi>Perſees,</hi> who (as they ſay) originally came out of <hi>Perſia,</hi> about that time <hi>Mahomet</hi> and his followers gave Laws to the <hi>Perſians,</hi> and impoſed a new Religion on them, which theſe <hi>Perſees</hi> not enduring left their Countrey, and came and ſetled themſelves in <hi>Eaſt-India,</hi> in the Province of <hi>Guzarat,</hi> where the moſt part of them ſtill continue (though there are ſome of them likewiſe in other parts of <hi>India)</hi> but where ever they live they confine themſelves ſtrictly to their own <hi>Tribe,</hi> or <hi>Sect.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For their Habits, they are clad like the other people of that Empire, but they ſhave not their hair cloſe as the other do, but ſuffer their bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Their profeſſion is for the generality all kinds of husbandry, imploying themſelves very much in ſowing and ſetting of Herbs; in planting and dreſſing of Vines, &amp; <hi>Palmeeto,</hi> or <hi>Toddy,</hi> Trees, as in planting and husbanding all other Trees bearing fruit, and indeed they are a very indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious people, and ſo are very many of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  <hi>Hindoos</hi> (as before obſerved) and they do all very well in doing ſo, and in this a due, and
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:115803:195"/>
deſerved commendation belongs unto them. For,</p>
               <p>There is no condition whatſoever can pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge a foulded arm. Our firſt Parents be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their fall <hi>were put into the Garden of</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>to dreſs it.</hi> Certainly if idleneſſe had been better than labour, they had never been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to do work but they muſt labour in their eſtate of innocency, becauſe they were hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and much more we in our ſinfull loſt eſtate that we may be ſo. It was a Law given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law, <hi>that man ſhould eat bread by the ſweat of his brows,</hi> and it is a Goſpel-precept too <hi>that he, who will not work, ſhould not eat. The ſluggard deſireth and hath nothing</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon)</hi> becauſe he doth nothing but deſire, and therefore his deſires do him no good, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his hands refuſe to labour.</hi> That <hi>body</hi> therefore well deſerves to pine and ſtarve with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pity, when two able hands cannot feed one mouth.</p>

                  </gap>t further for thoſe <hi>Perſees</hi> they uſe their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in meats &amp; drinks, to take of them what they pleaſe, but becauſe they would not give offence, either to the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> or <hi>Banians,</hi> or to other <hi>Hindoos</hi> amongſt whom they live, they abſtain from eating Beef, or Swines fleſh.</p>
               <p>It is their uſual manner to eat alone, as for every one of them to drink in his own Cup, and this is a means (as they think) to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:115803:195"/>
more pure, for if they ſhould eat with others, they are afraid that they might parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate of ſome uncleanneſſe by them.</p>
               <p>Alas poor Creatures that do not at all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand themſelves, and their moſt miſerable condition, <hi>for to them that are defiled, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing is nothing pure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet I obſerved before, the <hi>Mahometans</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> there are very ſtrict in this particular; ſo that they will not eat with any mixt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and many of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> not eat with one another. And this hath been an ancient cuſtom among Heathens. <hi>It is ſaid,</hi> Gen. 43. 32. <hi>that the</hi> Egyptians <hi>might not eat bread with the</hi> Hebrews, <hi>for that was an abomination to the</hi> Egyptians, for this very reaſon it was, that the women of <hi>Samaria</hi> ſpake thus unto our <hi>bleſſed Saviour,</hi> John 4. 9. <hi>how is it that thou being a</hi> Jew <hi>askeſt water of me, which am a woman of</hi> Samaria, <hi>for the</hi> Jews <hi>have no deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with the</hi> Samaritanes. But without doubt that forbearance, or ſhy-neſs to eat, one man with another can fetch no ground, either from religion, or reaſon, if it could, Peter <hi>would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have eaten with the Gentiles,</hi> Gal. 12. Nor our bleſſed Saviour <hi>with Publicans &amp; ſinners,</hi> at which the <hi>Scribes &amp; Phariſees</hi> take very much exception, <hi>Marc.</hi> 2. 16. No man as a man is to be accounted <hi>common, or unclean,</hi> Act. 10. 28. and a man ſhall do much better, who eats and
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:115803:196"/>
drinks with a <hi>ſober Heathen,</hi> than to keep company with a <hi>debaucht</hi> drunken ſenſual man, though he call himſelf a Chriſtian, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking with him <hi>ſuch things as pleaſe him,</hi> by being his companion in his Riot and exceſſe.</p>
               <p>For thoſe <hi>Perſees,</hi> further they believe that there is but one God, who made all things, and hath a Soveraign power over all. They talk much of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> and of other evil Spirits, but they ſay, that thoſe and all Devils beſides are kept ſo under, and in awe by two good <hi>Angels,</hi> that have power over them, as that they cannot hurt or do the leaſt miſchief, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their leave, and licence.</p>
               <p>As many of the <hi>Hindoos</hi> aſcribe to much unto water, (as before) ſo theſe to fire and the reaſon of it is this, becauſe they have had this tradition from many ages &amp; generations paſt, that their great Law-giver, whom they call <hi>Zertooſt</hi> was rapt up into Heaven, and there had fire delivered unto him, which he brought down thence, and he ever after commanded his followers to worſhip it and ſo they do, and further they love any thing that reſembles fire, as the Sun and Moon, and therefore when they pray in the day time they look towards the ſun, and ſo towards the Moon in their night-devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and from that ſo over-high eſteem they have of fire, they keep fires continually burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:115803:196"/>
in their <hi>Eggarees,</hi> or <hi>Temples</hi> in Lamps fed with Oyl, which are alwayes attended by their Prieſts, and they talk of many of theſe which have burned without extinguiſhment from many foregoing generations.</p>
               <p>And by the way, that wilde and mad phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of theirs, that their <hi>Zertooſt</hi> did fetch fire from Heaven is as certainly true, as that ancient fiction and fable of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> that he did ſteal fire thence.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, their Prieſts they call <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roos,</hi> or <hi>Harboods</hi> above both which they have a Chief, or High Prieſt they call the <hi>Deſtoor,</hi> who not often appears openly, but when he doth, he meets with much reverence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect given unto him by the common people, and ſo do thoſe other Church-men which are his inferiours: unto all which they allow free maintenance for their more comfortable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Thoſe Church-men by their Law are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to dwell near, and to abide much in their <hi>Eggar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

               <p>That living ſenſible Creature, which they firſt behold every morning (that is good &amp; ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable) is to them (as they ſay) a remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer all the day after, to draw up their thoughts
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:115803:197"/>
in thankſ-giving unto Almighty God; who hath made ſuch good Creatures for mans uſe and ſervice.</p>
               <p>There are good things (as I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) in that book of their Religion deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in precepts, which their Law-giver hath left unto them for the direction of their lives.</p>
               <p>As firſt, <hi>To have ſhame and fear ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with them, which will reſtrain, and keep them from the committing of many evils.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>when they undertake any thing, ſeriouſly to conſider whither it be good, or bad, commanded, or forbidden them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>To keep-their hearts and eyes from coveting any thing that is anothers, and their hands from hurting any.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>To have a care alwayes to ſpeak the truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>To be known onely in their own bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes, and not to enquire into, and to buſie themſelves in other mens matters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which are good moral precepts, but they have another which mars and ſpoils all the reſt, and that is upon the greateſt penalties they can be threatned withall.</p>
               <p>Sixthly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Not to entertain, or believe any other Law beſides that which was delivered unto them by their Law-giver.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This people take but one wife, which hath
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:115803:197"/>
liberty, as the wives of the <hi>Hindoos,</hi> to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. They never reſolve to take Wives, or Husbands without the advice of their Church-men, and when they come to be married, they ſtand ſome diſtance one from the other, there being two Church-men preſent on in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Man, and in behalf of the Woman the other. The firſt of theſe asks the Woman whither, or no ſhe will have that man to be her Husband, and the other asks the Man whither, or no, he will have that Woman to be his Wife, and they both conſenting, the Prieſts bring them together <hi>and join their hands,</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they may live in unity and love toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and then both thoſe Church-men ſcatter Rice upon the married couple, intreating God to make them fruitfull in ſending them many Sons and Daughters, that they may multiply as much as that <hi>ſeed</hi> doth in the ears that bear it. And ſo the Ceremony being thus performed, which is about the time of midnight, the whole company depart, leaving the married couple together.</p>
               <p>At the birth of every Childe, they imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſend for the <hi>Daroo,</hi> or Church-man, who comes to the parties houſe, and there being cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly enform'd of the exact time of the child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birth, firſt undertakes to <hi>calculate</hi> its Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to ſpeak ſomething of it by way of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, after which he confers with the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents

about a name whereby it ſhall be called, which when they have agreed upon, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the preſence of the company there aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, gives it that name.</p>
               <p>And now laſtly, touching the Burials of that people, they <hi>incircle pieces of ground</hi> with a round Wall, that is of a good height, ſet apart for that purpoſe.

               <p>NOw thoſe <hi>Mahometans</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> I have named, live under the ſubjection of the great <hi>Mogol,</hi> which <hi>Name,</hi> or rather <hi>Title</hi> (if my information abuſe me not) ſignifies cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, as himſelf, and the <hi>Mahometans</hi> are; and therefore for his moſt general title he is called the great <hi>Mogol,</hi> as the chief of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, or the chief of the circumciſion.</p>
               <p>He is lineally deſcended from that moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous conqueror, called in our ſtories <hi>Tamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane,</hi> concerning whoſe birth and original Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories much differ, and therefore I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine it; but in this, all that write of him agree, that he having got together very many huge multitudes of men, made very great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts in the <hi>South-Eaſt</hi> parts of the World, not onely on <hi>Bajazet</hi> the Emperour of the <hi>Turks,</hi> but alſo in <hi>Eaſt-India,</hi> and elſewhere; for what cannot force by multitudes do? This <hi>Tamberlane</hi> in their ſtories is called <hi>Amir Timur,</hi> or the great Prince and Emperor <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,</hi> who (as they ſay) towards his end, either by an hurt received in his thigh, or elſe by an unhappy fall from his Horſe, which made him

halt to his grave, was ever after that called <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur lang,</hi> or <hi>Timur the lame,</hi> from whence he is corruptly in our ſtories, named <hi>amberlane,</hi> the late <hi>Mogol,</hi> at whoſe Court we lived, was the ninth in a direct line, from that his great Anceſtor.</p>
               <p>And now that my Reader may ſee the great <hi>Mogol</hi> in a <hi>Portrature</hi> (which was taken from a Picture of his drawn to the life) I have cauſed that to be here inſerted, which preſents him in his dayly unvaried Habite, as he is bedeckt, and adorned with Jewels, he continually wears; for the faſhion of the Habite, in which he is here preſented, it is for the faſhion the Habite of that whole vaſt <hi>Empire;</hi> ſo that he who ſtrictly views this; may ſee the dreſſe of the men throughout that whole great Monarchy.</p>

Here are very high titles taken by <hi>Tamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane</hi> and his ſucceſſors, and the lower we go, the greater ſtill they are, but the laſt of them ſwels biggeſt of all, calling himſelf amongſt other phanſies <hi>the Conqueror of the world,</hi> and ſo he conceits himſelf to be; As they write of <hi>Thraſyllus</hi> the <hi>Athenian,</hi> who believed that all the ſhips on the Sea were his own, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would call them, <hi>my ſhips,</hi> when ever he ſaw them floating on the waters; and thus the great <hi>Magol</hi> imagines all the Kings, Nations, and people of the world to be his Slaves and Vaſſals.</p>
               <p>And therefore when the <hi>Grand Signiour,</hi> or great <hi>Turks</hi> ſent an Ambaſſador to the great <hi>Mogol,</hi> who came unto him attended with a great train and retinue, and after when he was ready to take his leave, deſired of the <hi>Mogol</hi> to know what he ſhould ſay to his Maſter when he was returned; tell thy Maſter ſaid the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gol</hi> that he is my <hi>ſlave,</hi> for my Anceſtor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mogol</hi> feeds and feaſts himſelf with this conceit, that he is <hi>Conqueror of the world,</hi> and therefore (I conceive that he was troubled upon a time, when my Lord-Ambaſſador, have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing buſineſſe with him, and upon thoſe terms; there is no coming unto that King empty handed without ſome preſent, or other (of which more afterward) and having at that

time nothing left, which he thought fit to give him, preſented him with <hi>Mercators</hi> great book of <hi>Coſmography</hi> (which the Ambaſſador had brought thither for his own uſe) telling the <hi>Mogol</hi> that that book deſcribed the four parts of the world, and all ſeveral Countreys in them contained, the <hi>Mogol</hi> at the firſt ſeem'd to be much taken with it, deſiring pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to ſee his own Territories, which were immediately ſhewen unto him, he asked where were thoſe Countreys about them, he was told <hi>Tartaria,</hi> and <hi>Perſia,</hi> as the names of the reſt which confine with him, and then cauſing the book to be turn'd all over, and finding no more to fall to his ſhare, but what he firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aw, and he calling himſelf the <hi>Conqueror of the world,</hi> and having no greater ſhare in it, ſeemed to be a little troubled, yet civily told the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour that neither himſelf, nor any of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did underſtand the language in which that book was written, and becauſe ſo, he further told him that he would not <hi>rob</hi> him of ſuch a <hi>Jewel,</hi> and therefore returned it unto him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>And the truth is, that the great <hi>Mogol</hi> might very well bring his action againſt <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cator</hi> and others, who deſcribe the world, but ſtreighten him very much in their Maps, not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing him to be Lord &amp; Commander of thoſe Provinces, which properly belong unto him.</p>

But it is true likewiſe that he, who hath the greateſt ſhare on the face of the earth, if it be compared with the whole world, appears not great. As it was ſaid of the Lands of <hi>Alcibia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> that compared with the Glob of the whole earth, they did not appear bigger than a ſmall tittle. The <hi>Mogols</hi> Territories are more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, large, and viſible, as any one may take notice, who ſtrictly views this affixed Map, wch is a true repreſentation of that great Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in its large dimenſions. So that although the <hi>Mogol</hi> be not maſter of the whole World, yet hath he a great ſhare in it, if we conſider his very large Territories, and his abundant riches, as will after more appear, whoſe wealth and ſtrength makes him ſo potent, as that he is able, whenſoever he pleaſeth to make <hi>inroades upon,</hi> and to do much miſchief unto any of his Neighbours, but I leave that, and come now to ſpeak.</p>

Hence the ancient Fathers naming the death of the faithfull their birth, and the day of their Martyrdom the day of their Nativity, ſhewed what great ſatisfaction and content they had, in the thought and hope of the life to come.

               </p>
               <p>I have been told by ſome, who were eye-witneſſes (whom I dare credite, and therefore I dare relate it) of ſtrange kindes of death exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by the command of the King of <hi>Japan</hi> upon his ſubjects, where ſome are <hi>Crucified,</hi> or nailed to a Croſſe: Others rather <hi>roasted, than burnt</hi> to death; Thus, there is a <hi>ſtake</hi> ſet up, and a Circle of fire at a pretty diſtance, made round about it; the condemned perſon being naked, is ſo faſtned to that ſtake, as that he may move round about it, and ſo doth as

               <p>Now they ſay that one great reaſon, why they put men there unto ſuch exquiſite tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is, becauſe they hold it a thing of the greateſt <hi>diſhonour</hi> there for any man to dye by the hand of an <hi>Executioner:</hi> therefore they are uſually commanded, when they are ſentenced to dye, to rip up, or cut open their own bellies, and thoſe who will not ſo do are tormented in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Hence moſt of that people, when as they have received that hard command to prevent death, by dying; call for their friends about them, eat, and ſeem to be merry with them, &amp; then in the cloſe of the meal, and in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, commit this ſad ſlaughter upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as firſt thoſe poor wretches make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves naked to the middle, he, or they, who are to dye, then the moſt wretched <hi>ſelf-murderer,</hi> who is to act that bloudy part, ſtrikes a ſharp Knife into the bottom of his belly, then rips himſelf up, and after gives himſelf one other cut croſs his belly, and when he hath done both theſe, if after he can but wipe his bloudy knife upon a white paper, or Napkin that is laid by him, he is believed to part with his life with a very great deal of honour, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately (as he is made to believe) goes to <hi>Faka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>

whom they ſay is the God of War. So much power the Devil hath in thoſe dark pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the World, to make the people there do what he pleaſe. Oh 'tis a miſery of all miſeries here, to be a drudge, a bond-man, a ſlave to the Devil! as thoſe, and ſo infinite multitudes more profeſſing Chriſt are, by obeying Satan in his moſt unreaſonable commands, and yet will not be made ſenſible of that, their baſeſt bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</p>
               <p>But to return again to the place fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence I have made ſome excurſion, when I was in <hi>India</hi> there was one ſentenced by the <hi>Mogol</hi> himſelf, for killing his own father to dye thus; firſt he commanded that this <hi>Paricide</hi> ſhould be bound alive by his heels, faſtned to a ſmall iron Chain, which was tied to the hinde leg of a great Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, and then that this Elephant ſhould drag him after him one whole remove of that King, from one place to another, which was about ten miles diſtant, that ſo all his fleſh might be worne off his bones, and ſo it was, when we ſaw him in the way following that King in his progreſſe, for he appeared then to us a <hi>skeliton,</hi> rather than a body.</p>
               <p>There was another condemned to dye by the <hi>Mogol</hi> himſelf, (while we were at <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davar)</hi> for killing his own Mother, and at this the King was much troubled to think of death; ſuitable for ſo horrid a crime, but upon a little
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:115803:209"/>
pauſe, he adjudged him to be ſtung to death by <hi>Snakes,</hi> which was accordingly done. I told you before that there are ſome <hi>Mountebanks</hi> there, which keep great <hi>Snakes</hi> to ſhew tricks with them; one of thoſe fellows was preſently called for to bring his <hi>Snakes</hi> to do that exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, who came to the place where that wretched Creature was appoin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed to dye, and found him there all naked (except a little co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering before) and trembling. Then ſuddenly the <hi>Mountebank</hi> (having firſt angred and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the venomous Creatures) put one of them to his Thigh, which preſently twin'd it ſelf about that part, till it came near his Groin, and there bit him till bloud followed, the other was faſtned to the outſide of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Thigh, twining about it, (for thoſe <hi>Snakes</hi> thus kept are, long and ſlender) and there bit him likewiſe, notwithſtanding, the wretch kept upon his feet nere a quarter of an hour, before which time the <hi>Snakes</hi> were taken from him; But he complained exceedingly of a fire that with much torment had poſſeſſed all his Limbs, and his whole body began to ſwell exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, like <hi>Naſidius,</hi> bit by a <hi>Lybian</hi> Serpent, called a <hi>Preſter,</hi> of whom Mr. <hi>May</hi> in his Tranſlation of <hi>Lucan,</hi> the ninth Book thus writes:</p>

                  <l>His face and cheeks a ſudden fire did roſt;</l>
                  <l>His fleſh and skin were ſtretch'd, his ſhape was loſt.</l>
                  <l>His ſwelling body is diſtended far,</l>
                  <l>Paſt humane growth, and undiſtinguiſh'd are</l>

                  <l>And he lies hid in his own body drown'd.</l>
               </q>
               <p>Now much after this manner did the ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe <hi>Snakes</hi> work upon that wretch, &amp; about half an hour after they were taken from him, the Soul of that unnatural Monſter left his growing Carkaſſe, and ſo went to its place. And certainly both thoſe I laſt named ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced, and ſo executed, moſt juſtly deſerved to be handled with all ſeverity, for taking away the lives of thoſe from whom they had receiv'd their own<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Some of our family did behold the execution done upon the later, who related all the paſſages of it, and for my part I might have ſeen it to, but that I had rather go a great way not to ſee, then one ſtep to behold ſuch a ſight.</p>
               <p>After the example of that King, his <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours</hi> deputed and ſet over Provinces and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties proceed in the courſe of Juſtice, to impoſe what puniſhment and death they pleaſe upon all offendors, and malefactors.</p>
               <p>That King never ſuffers any of his <hi>Vicege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> to tarry long in one place of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:115803:210"/>
but removes them uſually (after they have exerciſed that power, which was given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them in one place, for one year) unto ſome other place of Government, remote from the former, wherein they exerciſe their power, and this that King doth, that thoſe, which be his Subſtitutes, may not in any place grow Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</p>
               <p>I told them before that this people are very neat, ſhaving themſelves ſo often, as that they feel the Raſor almoſt every day; but when that King ſends any of them unto any place of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or upon any other imployment, they cut not their hair at all, till they return again into his preſence, as if they deſired not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear beautifull, or to give themſelves any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in this while they live out of the Kings ſight; and therefore the King, as ſoon as he ſees them, bids them cut their hair.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Mogol</hi> by Letters ſends his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to any of his Governours, thoſe papers are entertain'd with as much reſpect as if him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf were preſent; for the Governour having intelligence that ſuch Letters are come near him, himſelf with other inferiour Officers ride forth to meet the <hi>Patamar,</hi> or meſſenger that brings them, and as ſoon as he ſees thoſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he alights from his horſe, falls down on the earth, and then takes them from the meſſenger and layes them on his head, whereon he binds
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:115803:211"/>
them faſt, and then returning to his place of publick meeting, for diſpatch of buſineſſes, he reads them, and anſwers their contents with all care and diligence.</p>
               <p>The King oft times in his own perſon and ſo his ſubſtitutes appointed Governours for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces and Cities, Judge in all matters Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal that concern life and death. There are other Officers to aſſiſt them, which are called <hi>Cut-walls</hi> (whoſe Office is like that of our <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs</hi> in <hi>England)</hi> and theſe have many ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes under them, whoſe buſineſſe it is to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, and to bring before theſe Judges ſuch as are to be tried for things Criminal, or Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, where the Offender (as before) knows pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently what will become of him. And thoſe Officers wait likewiſe on other Judges there, which are called <hi>Cadees,</hi> who onely meddle with Contracts and Debts, and other buſineſſes of this Nature 'twixt man and man. Now theſe Officers arreſt Debtors, and bring them before thoſe Judges, and their ſureties too, bound as with us in Contracts confirmed (as before) under their hands and ſeals, and if they give not content unto thoſe which complain of them, they will impriſon their perſons, where they ſhall finde and feel the weight of fetters; nay, many times they will ſell their perſons, their Wives and Children into bondage, when they cannot ſatisfie their Debts; And the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom

               <p>The <hi>Mogol</hi> looked to be preſented with ſome thing, or other, when my Lord Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour came to him, and if he ſaw him often empty handed, he was not welcom, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company were wont eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year to ſend many particular things unto him, in the name of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that were given him at ſeveral times, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then when the Ambaſſadour had any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt unto him, which made a very fair way unto it.</p>
               <p>Amongſt many other things, when my Lord Ambaſſadour firſt went thither, the Company ſent the <hi>Mogol</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coach, and Harneſſe for four Horſes, and an able Coach-man, to ſute and mannage ſome of his excellent Horſes, that they might be made fit for that ſervice. The Coach they ſent was lined within with Crimſon <hi>China velvet,</hi> which when the <hi>Mogol</hi> took notice of, he told the Ambaſſadour that he wondred the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England</hi> would trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf ſo much, as to ſend unto <hi>China</hi> for Velvet to Line a Coach for him, in regard that he had been informed, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> King
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:115803:212"/>
had much better Velvet near home, for ſuch, or any other uſes.</p>
               <p>And immediately after the <hi>Mogol</hi> cauſed that Coach to be taken all to pieces, and to have another made by it, for (as before) they are a people that will make any new thing by a pattern, and when his new Coach was made according to the pattern, his work-men firſt putting the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coach together, did ſo with that they had new made, then pulling out all the <hi>China</hi> Velvet which was in the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Coach, there was in the room thereof put a very rich Stuffe, the ground ſilver, wrought all over in ſpaces with variety of flowers of ſilk, excellently well ſuited for their colours, and cut ſhort like a Pluſh, and in ſtead of the braſſe Nails that were firſt in it, there were Nails of ſilver put in their places. And the Coach, which his own work-men made was lined and ſeated likewiſe with a richer ſtuffe than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the ground of it Gold, mingled like the other with ſilk flowers, and the Nails ſilver and double guilt; and after having Horſes and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe fitted for both his Coaches, He rode ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in them, and contracted with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Coach-man to ſerve him, whom he made ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fine, by rich veſts he gave him, allowing him a very great Penſion; beſides, he never carried him in any of thoſe Coaches, but he gave him the reward of ten pounds at the leaſt, which
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:115803:212"/>
had raiſed the Coach-man unto a very great Eſtate, had not death prevented it, and that immediately after he was ſetled in that great ſervice.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company ſent other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents for that King, as excellent Pictures which pleaſed the <hi>Mogol</hi> very much, eſpecialy if there were fair and beautifull Women portrayed in them. They ſent likewiſe Swords, Rapiers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently well hatcht, and pieces of rich <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery</hi> to make ſweet baggs, and rich Gloves, and handſome Looking glaſſes, &amp; other things to give away, that they might have alwayes ſome things in readineſs to preſent both to the King, and alſo to his Governours, where our Factories were ſetled, for all theſe were like thoſe <hi>rulers of Iſrael</hi> mentioned, <hi>Hoſea 4. 18. who would love to ſay with ſhame, give ye.</hi> They looked to be preſented with ſomething, when our Factors had any eſpecial occaſion to repair unto them, and if the particular thing they then preſented did not like them well, they would deſire to have it exchanged for ſomething elſe, happily they having never heard of our good and modeſt proverb, <hi>that a man muſt not look into the mouth of a given Horſe.</hi> And it is a very poor thing indeed which is freely given, and is not worth the taking.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mogol</hi> ſometimes by his <hi>Firmauns,</hi> or
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:115803:213"/>
or Letters Patents, will grant ſome particular things unto ſingle, or divers perſons, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after will contradict thoſe Grants by other Letters, excuſing himſelf thus, that he is a great, and an abſolute King, and therefore muſt not be tied unto any thing, which if he were, he ſaid that he was a ſlave, and not a free man: Ye what he promiſed was uſually enjoyed, although he would not be tied to a certain performance of his promiſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be no dealing with this King upon very ſure terms, who will ſay and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, promiſe and deny. Yet we <hi>Engliſh</hi> men did not at all ſuffer by that inconſtancy of his, but there found a free Trade, a peaceable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence, and a very good eſteem with that King and people; and much the better (as I conceive) by reaſon of the prudence of my Lord Ambaſſadour, who was there (in ſome ſenſe) <hi>like Joſeph</hi> in the <hi>Court of Pharoah,</hi> for whoſe ſake all his Nation there, ſeemed to fare the better.

God ſave King</hi> Solomon: and thus they clapped their hands for joy when <hi>Jehoaſh</hi> was made King, crying, <hi>God ſave the King,</hi> or let the King live, 2 <hi>King</hi> 11. 12.) At noon he ſhews himſelf in another place like the former, on the South-ſide, and a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sun-ſet, in a like place, on the Weſt-ſide
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:115803:214"/>
of his houſe, or Tent, but as ſoon as the Sun forſakes the <hi>Hemisphear,</hi> he leaves his people uſhered in and out with Drums and Winde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and the peoples acclamations.</p>
               <p>At both which times likewiſe very great numbers of his people aſſemble together to preſent themſelves before him: And at any of theſe three times, he that hath a <hi>ſuite</hi> to the King or deſires Juſtice at his hands, be he poor, or Rich, if he hold up a Petition to be ſeen, ſhall be heard and anſwered.</p>
               <p>And between ſeven and nine of the Clock at night, he ſits within his Houſe, or Tent, more privately in a ſpacious place, called his <hi>Goozal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> or bathing houſe made bright, like day by abundance of lights, and here the King ſits mounted upon a ſtately <hi>Throne,</hi> where his Nobles and ſuch as are favoured by him ſtand about him, others finde admittance to, but by ſpecial leave from his Guard, who cauſe every one that enters that place to breath upon them, and if they imagine that any have drunk wine, they keep him out.</p>
               <p>At this time my Lord Ambaſſadour made his uſual addreſſes to him, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I often waited on him thither, and it was a good time to do buſineſſe with that King, who then was for the moſt part very pleaſant, and full of talk unto thoſe which were round about him, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till he fell a ſleep, (oft times by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:115803:214"/>
and then all aſſembled immediately quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the place, beſides thoſe which were his tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted ſervants, who by turns watched his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mogol</hi> hath a moſt ſtately, rich and ſpacious houſe at <hi>Agrae,</hi> his <hi>Metropolis,</hi> or chief Citie, which is called his <hi>Palace Royal,</hi> wherein there are two Towers, or Turrets a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ten foot ſquare covered with maſſie God (as ours are uſualy with Lead) this I had from <hi>Tom. Coriat,</hi> as from other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants, who keep in a Factory at that place. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they told me, that he hath a moſt glorious <hi>Throne</hi> within that his Palace, aſcended by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſteps, which are covered with plate of <hi>ſilver,</hi> upon the top of which aſcent ſtand four <hi>Lions</hi> upon pedeſtals (of curiouſly coloured Marble) which Lions are all made of <hi>Maſſie ſilver,</hi> ſome part of them guilded with Gold, and beſet with precious ſtones. Thoſe Lions ſupport a <hi>Canopy</hi> of pure Gold, under which the <hi>Mogol</hi> ſits, when as he appears in his greateſt ſtate and glory.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>beauty</hi> of that <hi>Court</hi> it conſiſts not in gay and Gorgious apparel, for the Countrey is ſo hot, that they cannot endure any thing that is very warm, or maſſie, or rich about them. The <hi>Mogol</hi> himſelf for the moſt part is cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a garment (as before deſcribed) made of pure, white, and fine Callico Laune, and ſo
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:115803:215"/>
are his Nobles, which Garments are waſhed after one dayes wearing. But for the <hi>Mogol,</hi> though his cloathing be not rich and coſtly, yet I believe that there is never a Monarch in the whole world that is dayly adorned with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Jewels as himſelf is. Now, they are Jewels which make mens covering moſt rich, ſuch as people in other parts ſometimes wear about them, that are otherwiſe moſt meanly habited, to which purpoſe I was long ſince told by a Gentleman of honour ſent as a Companion to the old<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Earle of Nothingham,</hi> when he was imployed as an extraordinary Ambaſſadour by King <hi>James,</hi> to confirm the peace made 'twixt himſelf and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> which Ambaſſadour had a very great many <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> in his train, in as Rich <hi>cloathing</hi> as <hi>Velvets</hi> and <hi>Silks</hi> could make, but then there did appear many a great <hi>Don,</hi> or <hi>Grandee</hi> in the <hi>Spaniſh Court,</hi> in a long black bayes Cloak and Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack, which had one <hi>Hatband of Diamonds,</hi> which was of more worth by far, than all the <hi>bravery</hi> of the Ambaſſadours many <hi>followers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for the <hi>Mogol</hi> I wonder not at his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Jewels, he being (as I conceive) the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and richeſt Maſter of precious ſtones that inhabites the whole earth. For <hi>Diamonds</hi> (which of all other are accounted moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones) they are found in <hi>Decan</hi> (where the Rocks are, out of which they are digged)
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:115803:215"/>
the Princes whereof are the next Neighbours and Tributares to the great <hi>Mogol,</hi> and they pay him as Tribute many Diamonds yearly, and further, he hath the refuſal of all thoſe rich ſtones they ſell, he having Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the greateſt abundance, (and that will purchaſe any thing but heaven) and he will part with any mony for any <hi>Gems</hi> beſide, that are precious and great, whither <hi>Rubies,</hi> or any other ſtones of value, as alſo for rich <hi>Pearls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And his Grandees follow him in that phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, for one of his great Lords gave our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants there, twelve hundred pounds ſterling for one Pearle, which was brought out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> The Pearle was ſhaped like a Pare, very large, beautifull, and Orient, and ſo its price deſerved it ſhould be.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Mogol</hi> having ſuch an abundance of Jewels, wears many of them dayly, enough to exceed thoſe women, which <hi>Rome</hi> was wont to ſhew in their <hi>Starlike dreſſes,</hi> who in the height and proſperity of that Empire
<q>
                     <l>—Were ſaid to wear</l>

               </p>
               <p>Or, <hi>Lollia Paulina,</hi> who was hid with Jewels. For the great <hi>Mogol,</hi> the Diamonds, and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, and Pearls, which are very many, &amp; dayly worn by him, are all of an extraordinary great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and conſequently of an exceeding great
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:115803:216"/>
value. And beſides thoſe he wears about his <hi>Shaſh,</hi> or head covering, he hath a long Chain of Jewels hanging about his Neck (as long as an ordinary Gold Chain) others about his wriſts, and the Hilts of his Sword and Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger are moſt curiouſly enriched with thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones, beſides others of very great value, which he wears in Rings on his fingers.</p>

               </q>
               <p>The firſt of <hi>March</hi> the <hi>Mogol</hi> begins a royal Feaſt, like that which <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> made in the third year of his Reign, <hi>Eſth. 1. wherein he ſhewed the riches of his glorious Kingdom.</hi> This feaſt the <hi>Mogol</hi> makes, is called the <hi>Noo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roos,</hi> that ſignifies nine dayes, which time it continues, to uſher in the new year, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with the <hi>Mahometans</hi> there, the tenth day of <hi>March.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt which Feaſt, the Nobles aſſemble themſelves together at that Court in their greateſt Pomp, preſenting their King with great gifts, and he requiting them again with Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely rewards, at which time I being in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, beheld moſt immenſe and incredible
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:115803:216"/>
riches, to my amazement, in Gold, Pearls, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones, Jewels, and many other glittering vanities. This Feaſt is uſually kept by the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gol</hi> while he is in his Progreſſe, and lodges in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ents.</p>
               <p>Whether his Diet at this time be greater than ordinary I know not, for he alwayes eats in private among his Women, where none but his own Family ſee him while he is eating; which Family of his conſiſts of his Wives and Children, and Women, and Eunuchs, and his boyes, and none but theſe abide and lodge in the Kings houſes, or Tents, and therefore how his Table is ſpread, I could never know, but doubtleſſe he hath of all thoſe vanities that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire affords, if he ſo pleaſe. His food (they ſay) is ſerved in unto him in Veſſels of Gold, which covered, and brought unto him by his Eunuchs, after it is <hi>proved</hi> by his <hi>Taſters</hi> he eats, not at any ſet times of the day, but he hath proviſion ready at all times, and calls for it when he is hungry, and never but then.</p>
               <p>The firſt of <hi>September</hi> (which was the late <hi>Mogols</hi> birth day) he retaining an ancient yearly Cuſtom, was in the preſence of his chief <hi>Grandies</hi> weighed in a <hi>Balance,</hi> the Ceremony performed within his Houſe, or Tent, in a fair ſpacious Room, whereinto none were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted but by ſpecial leave. The <hi>Scales</hi> in which he was thus weighed were plated with
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:115803:217"/>
Gold, and ſo the beam on which they hung, by great <hi>Chains</hi> made likewiſe of that moſt precious <hi>Metal,</hi> the King ſitting in one of them was weighed firſt <hi>againſt ſilver Coin,</hi> which immediately after was diſtributed among the <hi>poor,</hi> then was he weighed againſt Gold, after that againſt Jewels (as they ſay) but I obſerved (being preſent there with my Lord Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour) that he was weighed againſt three ſeveral things, laid in ſilken <hi>Bags</hi> on the contrary Scale, when I ſaw him in the <hi>Balance I thought on</hi> Belſhazzar, <hi>who was found</hi> to light, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5. 27. By his weight (of which his Phyſicians yearly keep an exact account) they preſume to gueſſe of the preſent eſtate of his body, of which they ſpeak flatteringly, however they think it to be.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Mogol</hi> is thus weighed, he caſts about among the ſtanders by <hi>thin pieces of ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> &amp; ſome of Gold, made like flowers of that Countrey, and ſome of them are made like <hi>Cloves,</hi> and ſome like <hi>Nutmegs,</hi> but very thin and hollow. Then he drinks to his Nobles in his <hi>Royal wine</hi> (as that of <hi>Ahaſuerus is called)</hi> Eſth. 1. 7.) who pledge his health, at which ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity he drank to my Lord Ambaſſadour, in a Cup of <hi>Gold</hi> moſt curiouſly <hi>enameled,</hi> and ſet all over the outſide with <hi>ſtones</hi> (which were ſmall Rubies, Turkeſſes, and Emeralds) with a Cover, or Plate to ſet it in, both of <hi>pure Gold,</hi>
                  <pb n="397" facs="tcp:115803:217"/>
the brims of which plate, and the cover were <hi>enameled,</hi> and ſet with <hi>ſtones</hi> as the other, and all theſe together weighed <hi>twenty &amp; four ounces of our</hi> Engliſh <hi>weight,,</hi> which he then gave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Lord Ambaſſadour, whom he ever uſed with very much reſpect, and would moreover often ask him why he did not deſire ſome good, and great gifts at his hands, he being a great King, and able to give it, the Ambaſſadour would reply, that he came not thither to beg any thing of him, all that he deſired was that his Countrey-men the <hi>Engliſh</hi> might have a free and ſafe and peaceable trade in his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, the <hi>Mogol</hi> would anſwer that he was bound in honour to afford them that, we co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from the furthermoſt parts of the world to trade there, and would often bid the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadour to ask ſomething for himſelf, who to this would anſwer, that if that King knew not better to give, then <hi>he</hi> knew to <hi>ask,</hi> he muſt have nothing from him, upon theſe terms they continually both ſtood, ſo that in concluſion the Ambaſſadour had no gift from him, but that before mentioned, beſides an horſe, or two, and ſometimes a <hi>Veſt,</hi> or upper Garment made of ſlight Cloath of Gold, which the <hi>Mogol</hi> would firſt put upon his own back, and then give it to the Ambaſſadour. But the <hi>Mogol</hi> (if he had ſo pleaſed) might have beſtowed on him ſome great <hi>Princely gift,</hi> and found no
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:115803:218"/>
greater miſſe of it, than there would be of a Glaſſe of water taken out of a great Fountain; yet although the <hi>Mogol</hi> had ſuch infinite Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, yet he could finde room to ſtore up more ſtill, the deſires of a covetous heart being ſo unſatiable, as that it never knows when it hath enough, being like a bottomleſſe purſe that can never be fill'd, for the more it hath, the more ſtill it covets.</p>
               <p>See an image hereof in <hi>Alcmaeon,</hi> who being will'd by <hi>Craeſus</hi> to go into his Treaſure houſe, and there take as much Gold as himſelf could carry away, provided for that purpoſe a long Garment that was double down to his <hi>ankles,</hi> and great <hi>bootes,</hi> and fill'd them both; nay, he ſtuffed his <hi>mouth,</hi> and tied wedges of Gold to the <hi>locks</hi> of his <hi>head,</hi> and doubtleſſe, but for killing himſelf, he would have fill'd his <hi>skull</hi> &amp; <hi>bowels</hi> therewith. Here was an <hi>heart</hi> ſet upon Gold, and Gold over-lading an heart, for the Man ſtowing ſo much about him, as that he could not ſtir with it, forfeited what he might have had, and was turned out of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, as poor and empty as he came into it. He is a <hi>rich</hi> man whatever he hath (be it more, or leſſe) that is <hi>contented.</hi> He is a <hi>poor</hi> man, who ſtill wants more, in becoming poor by plenty, wanting what he hath, as well, as much, as what he hath not, and ſo do very many, who are the greateſt engroſſers of the worlds wealth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="399" facs="tcp:115803:218"/>
But certainly there is no heart more poor and barren than that which is ſet upon abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and as a the ground wherein there are <hi>Mines</hi> of Gold and Silver, and the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Stones is moſt <hi>barren;</hi> ſo the <hi>hearts</hi> of ſuch as are moſt violently carried on after the deſire of theſe things are moſt <hi>barren likewiſe.</hi> Therfore almighty God in wiſdom hath laid up Treaſures in the bowels of the earth <hi>ſecretly,</hi> and <hi>baſely, ſecretly</hi> that they ſhould not be to much <hi>ſought after,</hi> and <hi>baſely,</hi> that they ſhould not be too much <hi>deſired</hi> nor valued. Hence the Prophet <hi>Habak.</hi> 2 6. ſpeaks thus to covetous men, <hi>woe be to him that lades himſelf with thick clay, how long?</hi> where riches are compared to <hi>thick clay,</hi> becauſe they are but the very ſelf-ſame earth we tread on, better <hi>hardened</hi> and <hi>coloured;</hi> and becauſe they are many times a burden unto him that hath them, <hi>how long?</hi> ſaith the Prophet is there no end of encreaſing? <hi>how long?</hi> hath the <hi>Sea</hi> bars and bounds. and the deſires of man in this caſe without all <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration? how long?</hi> can any ever hope to fill and ſatisfie their hearts with this? let them know that the barren <hi>womb,</hi> and the unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>grave,</hi> and unſatiable <hi>death</hi> will ſooner be <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> than the <hi>hearts</hi> ſet upon riches find ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction from them, for <hi>he that loveth ſilver ſhall not be ſatisfied with ſilver,</hi> Eccleſ. 5. 10. and therefore they who can come up to a right
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:115803:219"/>

               <p>And it happened that (but a few years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our abode there) a <hi>Juggler</hi> of <hi>Bengala</hi> (a Kingdom famous for Witches, and men of that profeſſion) brought an <hi>Ape</hi> before the King (who was ever greedy to pleaſe himſelf with Novelties) profeſſing that he would do many ſtrange feats, the <hi>Mogol</hi> was ready preſently to make a trial of this, and forthwith called ſome <hi>boyes</hi> about him (which he was conceived to keep for ſuch a uſe as I dare not name,) &amp; pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a Ring from his finger gave it one of them to hide, that he might make a trial whither, or no the Ape could finde it out; who preſently went to the boy that had it.

               </p>
               <p>Then <hi>Mahobet-Chan,</hi> a great Noble man of that Court, and in high favour with the King, ſaid, that it was ſome impoſture of the Chriſtians (though there were none that did bear that name there preſent) and deſired that he might make a third trial, which granted, he put but eleven of thoſe names together, reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in his hand; the Ape ſearching as before, pull'd forth his <hi>paw empty,</hi> and ſo twice, or thrice together, the <hi>King</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:115803:221"/>
a reaſon for this, was anſwered, that happily the thing he looked for was not there, he was bid to ſearch for it, and then putting out thoſe <hi>eleven names</hi> one after the other, in a ſeeming indignation <hi>rent them,</hi> then running to <hi>Mahobet-Chan</hi> caught him by the hand where the Name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>concealed,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, he opened the <hi>Scrolle,</hi> and ſo held it up to the <hi>King,</hi> but did not tear it as the former, upon which the <hi>Mogol</hi> took the Ape, and gave his Keeper a good Penſion for to keep him near about him, calling him the <hi>Divining Ape,</hi> and this was all that followed upon this admirable thing, except the great wonder and amazement of that people.</p>
               <p>There was one ſome years ſince wrote this ſtory (but ſomewhat varied from that I have here related) in a little printed Pamphlet, and told his Reader that I had often ſeen that Ape while I lived in thoſe parts, which particular he ſhould have left out; but for the Relation it ſelf, I believe it was ſo, becauſe it hath been often confirmed there in its report unto me by divers <hi>perſons,</hi> who knew not one another, and were differing in Religion, yet all agreed in the <hi>ſtory,</hi> and in all the <hi>circumſtances</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>This I am ſure of that Almighty God, who can do what he will do (for all things are ſo far from being impoſſible to him, that nothing is hard) can do <hi>wonderfull things</hi> by the <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:115803:222"/>
means,</hi> that the <hi>weaker</hi> the inſtruments are, the more <hi>glory</hi> moy be aſcribed unto him while he acts by them.</p>
               <p>In the ſacred ſtorie <hi>Pharoah</hi> had no ſooner asked, who is the Lord? <hi>Ex.</hi> 5. but preſently ſome of the weakeſt of the Creatures riſe up, and appear (as it were in Arms) to tell him, who the Lord was; ſo that he who formerly thought that there was no power, either in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, or earth, to maſter, or contradict him, is preſently confuted, and conquered by <hi>Frogs,</hi> and <hi>Flies,</hi> and <hi>Lice,</hi> and <hi>Caterpillars,</hi> by thoſe poor, infirm, ſilly, and moſt deſpicable <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> who when they had entred the liſts, would not give proud <hi>Pharoah</hi> over, till they had humbled him, and magnified their maker, <hi>virtus Dei in infirmitate. Balaams</hi> Aſſe had more diſcovered unto him than unto his Rider, and ſo had this <hi>Ape</hi> (as it ſhould ſeem) more, than to his <hi>beholders,</hi> or to his keeper.</p>
               <p>Now for the diſpoſition of that King, it ever ſeemed unto me to be compoſed of <hi>extreams,</hi> for ſometimes he was barbarouſly cruel, and at other times he would ſeem to be exceeding fair, and gentle.</p>
               <p>For his cruelties, he put one of his women to a miſerable death, one of his women he had formerly touched and kept Company withall, but now ſhe was ſuperannuated, for neither himſelf nor Nobles (as they ſay) come near
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:115803:222"/>
their wives, or women, after they exceed the age of thirty years, though they keep them, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them ſome maintenance. The fault of that woman, this the <hi>Mogol</hi> upon a time found her, and one of his Eunuchs kiſſing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and for this very thing the King preſently gave command that a round hole ſhould be made in the earth, and that her body ſhould be put into that hole, where ſhe ſhould ſtand with her head onely above ground, and the earth to be put in again unto her cloſe, round about her, that ſo ſhe might ſtand in the parching Sun, till the extream hot <hi>beams</hi> thereof did kill her, in which torment ſhe lived one whole day, and the night following, and almoſt till the next noon, crying out moſt lamentably while ſhe was able to ſpeak in her language, as the <hi>Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namites</hi> Childe did in his 2 <hi>King. 4. Ah my head, my head!</hi> which horrid execution, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther murder was acted near our houſe, where the Eunuch by the command of the ſaid King was brought very near the place where this poor Creature was thus buried alive, and there in her ſight <hi>cut all into pieces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That great King would be often overcome by Wine, yet (as if he meant to appropriate that ſin to himſelf) would puniſh others with very much ſeverity, who were thus diſtempered.</p>
               <p>I have long ſince heard a ſtory which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what pararel to this, that in former times when
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:115803:223"/>
this land, in which we live, did not ſo much ſtink of that beaſtly ſin of drunkenneſſe, which robs a man of himſelf, and leaves a beaſt in the skin of a man, I ſay, when drunkenneſſe in <hi>England</hi> was not ſo common: There was a <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of Peace</hi> in this Nation (and I believe that the ſtory is very true) which laid a poor <hi>Butoher</hi> by the heels for preſuming to be drunk, telling him that he was but a poor beggerly fellow, and he preſume to be drunk, and therefore he would puniſh him, ſaying further, that it was enough for his eldeſt Son ſo to be, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but this by the way.</p>
               <p>Sometimes for little, or no faults, the <hi>Mogol</hi> would cauſe men to be moſt ſeverely whip't, till they were almoſt ready to dye under the rod, which after they muſt kiſſe in thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
               <p>He cauſed one of his ſervants of the higher ranke, to be very much whipt for breaking a <hi>China</hi> Cup he was commanded to keep ſafe, and then ſent him into <hi>China,</hi> (which is a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velous diſtance from thence) to buy another.</p>
               <p>Sometimes in other of his mad diſtempers he would condemne men to <hi>ſervitude,</hi> or <hi>diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> or elſe put them to death, as ſacrifices to his will and paſſion, not Juſtice. So that it might be ſaid of him <hi>quando male nemo pejus,</hi> that when he did wickedly none could do worſe, as if it had been true of him which was ſpoken
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:115803:223"/>
of that monſter <hi>Nero</hi> obſerved before, who was called <hi>Lutum ſanguine maceratum,</hi> dirt ſoaked in bloud.</p>
               <p>For his good actions he did relieve conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually many poor people; and not ſeldom would ſhew many expreſſions of duty and ſtrong affection to his Mother, then living, ſo that he who eſteemed the whole World as his Vaſſals would help to carry her in a <hi>Palankee</hi> upon his ſhoulders, and in this he did exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly differ from that moſt unnatural and cruel <hi>Nero,</hi> who moſt barbarouſly killed his own Mother <hi>Agrippina,</hi> cauſing (as they write) that Bed, in which he was conceived, and from whence born, and wherein he took up his firſt lodging to be ript up and ſpoiled.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mogol</hi> would often viſite the cells of thoſe he eſteemed religious men, whoſe perſons he eſteemed ſacred, as if they had been <hi>Demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gods.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And he would ſpeak moſt reſpectively of our bleſſed Saviour Chriſt, but his Parentage, his poverty, and his croſſe did ſo confound his thoughts, that he knew not what to think of them. (As <hi>Bernard</hi> complained of ſome in his time, that they took offence at the clowts and rags of our <hi>bleſſed Saviour,</hi> at the humility and meanneſſe of his birth) believing that it could not ſtand with the Majeſty of the <hi>Son of God</hi> to appear in the World, in ſuch meanneſſe
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:115803:224"/>
as he did; though he had been told that <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> came into the World in that low condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he might beat down the pride thereof. And that at his firſt <hi>coming</hi> he came for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and then he came in great <hi>humility</hi> but at his ſecond coming he ſhall come againſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and then will he appear in power, &amp; great glory.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the <hi>Mogol</hi> is very free and noble un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all thoſe which fall into, and abide in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which brings me now to ſpeak.</p>

               <p>WHich great revenues that many of them do enjoy, makes them to live like great Princes rather than other men.

and appointed for that purpoſe. Now ſome of the <hi>Mogol</hi>'s moſt beloved Nobles have the pay of <hi>ſix thouſand horſe;</hi> and there are others (at the leaſt twenty in his Empire) which have the pay of 5000. horſe, exceeding large Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions above the <hi>revenue</hi> of any other Subjects in the whole World, they amounting unto more than <hi>one hundred thouſand pounds</hi> yearly unto a <hi>particular man.</hi> Now others have the pay of <hi>four thouſand horſe;</hi> others of three, or two, or one thouſand horſe, and ſo downward, and theſe by their proportions, are appointed to have horſes alwayes in readineſſe well mann'd and otherwiſe appointed for the Kings ſervice, ſo that he who hath the pay of five, or ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, muſt alwayes have one thouſand in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe, or more, according to the Kings need of them, and ſo in proportion all the reſt which enables them on a ſudden to make up the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, at the leaſt of <hi>two hundred thouſand horſe,</hi> of which number, they have alwayes at hand one hundred thouſand to wait upon the King whereſoever he is.</p>
               <p>There are very many private men in Cities and Towns, who are Merchants, or Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that are very rich, but it is not ſafe for them that are ſo, ſo to appear, leaſt that they ſhould be uſed as <hi>fill'd ſponges.</hi>

               <p>WHich indeed is very glorious, as all muſt confeſſe, who have ſeen the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of Tents, or Pavilions there pitched together which in a plain make a ſhew equal to a moſt ſpacious and glorious Citie. Theſe Tents I ſay, when they are altogether, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuch a great quantity of ground, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is five <hi>Engliſh</hi> miles at the leaſt, from one ſide of them to the other, very beautifull to
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:115803:228"/>
behold from ſome Hill, where they may be all ſeen at once.</p>
               <p>They write of <hi>Zerxes,</hi> that when from ſuch a place he took a view of his very numerous Army, conſiſting at the leaſt of three hundred thouſand men, he wept, ſaying, that in leſs than the compaſſe of one hundred years, not one of that great mighty Hoſt would be alive. And to ſee ſuch company then together of all ſorts of people (and I ſhall give a good reaſon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently why I believe that mixt company of men, women, and children may make up ſuch an huge number, as before I named, if not exceed it) and to conſider that death will ſeize upon them all, within ſuch a ſpace of time, and that <hi>the ſecond death hath ſuch a power over them,</hi> is a thing of more ſad conſideration.</p>
               <p>Now to make it appear that the number of people of all ſorts is ſo exceeding great, which here get, and keep together in the <hi>Mogols Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kar,</hi> or Camp Royal; firſt there are one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand Souldiers, which alwayes wait about that King (as before obſerved) and all his <hi>Grandees</hi> have a very great train of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers and ſervants to attend them there, and ſo have all other men according to their ſeveral qualities, and all theſe carry their Wives and Children, and whole family with them, which muſt needs amount to a very exceeding great number. And further to demonſtrate this,
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:115803:229"/>
when that King removes from one place to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, for the ſpace of twelve hours, a broad paſſage is continually fill'd with paſſengers, and Elephants, and Horſes, and Dromedaries, and Camels, and Coaches, and Aſſes, and Oxen, (on which the meaner ſort of men and women with their little Children, ride) ſo full as they may well paſſe one by the other. Now in ſuch a broad paſſage, and in ſuch a long time, a very great number of people, the company conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually moving on forward, may paſſe.</p>
               <p>Thus this people moving on from place to place, it may be ſaid of them, what <hi>Salvian</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> while they were in their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to <hi>the land of promiſe,</hi> that it was <hi>Ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans reſpublica,</hi> a walking Common-wealth. And therefore that ancient people of God were called <hi>Hebrews,</hi> which ſignified paſſengers, and their dwelling ſo in Tents, ſignified thus much to all the people of God in all ſucceeding ages, that here they dwell in moveable habitations, <hi>having no continuing City here,</hi> but they muſt <hi>look for one, and that is above.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is obſerved of <hi>Cain,</hi> that he (a wicked man) was a tiller of the ground, (though that calling of it ſelf deſerves much commendation) or as a man faſtned to the earth, whereas <hi>Abel</hi> his brother (a man fearing God) was a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, which is a moving, rouling occupation, from one place to another, <hi>thou telleſt my flit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,</hi>

ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Here we often ſhift our places, and our company, and muſt do ſo, our buſineſſes carrying us up and down, to and fro, but our felicity hereafter ſhall conſiſt in reſt, in not changing for ever after, either our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, or place, but when the Godly man ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh, as an hireling his day, when his work, which God hath appointed him here to do, is done and finiſhed, he ſhall lye down in peace, and receive his penny, and enjoy his reward.</p>
               <p>The Tents pitch'd in that <hi>Leskar,</hi> or Camp Royal are for the moſt part white, like the cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of thoſe which own them. But the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gols</hi> Tents are red, reared up upon Poles, higher by much than the other. They are placed in the middeſt of the Camp, where they take up a very large compaſſe of ground, and may be ſeen every way, and they muſt needs be very great to afford room in them, for himſelf, his wives, children, women, Eunuchs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſore-front, or outward part, or Court within his Tent, there is a very large room for acceſſe to him, 'twixt ſeven and nine of the Clock at night, which (as before) is called his <hi>Goozulcad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Tents are encompaſſed round with <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats,</hi> which are like our <hi>Screenes</hi> to fold up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; thoſe <hi>Canats</hi> are about ten foot high, made of narrow ſtrong <hi>Callico,</hi> and lined with the ſame, ſtiffened at every breadth with a <hi>Cane,</hi>
                  <pb n="422" facs="tcp:115803:230"/>
but they are ſtrongeſt lined on their outſide by a very great company of <hi>arm'd Souldiers,</hi> that keep cloſe about them night and day. The Tents of his great men are likewiſe large, placed round about his. All of them throughout the whole <hi>Leskar</hi> reared up in ſuch a due and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant order, that when we remove from place to place, we can go as directly to thoſe move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>dwellings,</hi> as if we continued ſtill in fixed and <hi>ſtanding habitations,</hi> taking our direction from ſeveral <hi>ſtreets</hi> and <hi>Bazars,</hi> or Market places, every one pitched upon every remove alike, upon ſuch, or ſuch a ſide of the Kings Tents, as if they had not been at all removed.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Mogol</hi> (which I ſhould have obſerved before) hath ſo much wealth, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo much power, by reaſon of his marvelous great multitudes of fighting men; which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes keeps in Arms, commanding at all times as many of them as he pleaſe, that as the <hi>Moabites</hi> truely ſaid of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> (while they had Almighty God fighting with them, and for them) ſo it may be ſaid of him (if God reſtrain him not) that his huge Companies are able to <hi>lick up all that are round about him, as the Oxe licketh up the graſſe of the field,</hi> Numb. 22. 4.</p>
               <p>When that mighty King, removes from one place to another, he cauſeth <hi>Drums</hi> to be beat about midnight, which is a <hi>ſignal</hi> token of his removing. He r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And that he might raiſe up, his beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unnatural luſts, even to the very height, he kept boyes as before <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His moſt beloved wife (when I lived at his Court) he called <hi>Noor-Mahal,</hi> which ſignified the <hi>light of the Court,</hi> and to the other of his Wives, and Women, which he moſt loved, he gave new names unto them, and ſuch names as he moſt fancied.</p>
               <p>For his Wife I firſt named, he took her out of the duſt, from a very mean family, but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhe made ſuch a through conqueſt on his affections, that ſhe engroſſed almoſt all his love, did what ſhe pleaſed in the Government of that Empire, where ſhe advanced her brother <hi>Aſaph-Chan;</hi> and other her neareſt relations, to the greateſt places of Command and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and profit in that vaſt Monarchy.</p>
               <p>Her brother <hi>Aſaph-Chan</hi> was preſently made one of the <hi>Starres</hi> of the firſt <hi>Magnitude</hi> that ſhined in that <hi>Indian Court,</hi> and when he had once gotten, ſo kept the <hi>Mogols</hi> favour by the aſſiſtance of his ſiſter <hi>Noor-Mahal,</hi> that by the Penſions given, and many Offices beſtowed on him, he heaped up a Maſſe of Treaſure above all belief (as before) and married his daughter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Sultan Caroom,</hi> who is now King.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="428" facs="tcp:115803:233"/>
The <hi>Mogol</hi> of all his ſo many Wives and Concubines had but <hi>ſix</hi> Children, five Sons and one Daughter. The names he gave his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and others were names that proceeded from Counſel (as he imagined) rather than chance. His eldeſt Son was called <hi>Sultan Coob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurroo,</hi> which ſignified the Prince with the <hi>good face,</hi> his perſon and beauty anſwered his name, for he was a Prince of a very lovely preſence. His ſecond Son he called <hi>Sultan Perum,</hi> Prince of the <hi>Pleiades,</hi> or <hi>of the ſweet influences of the</hi> Pleiades. His third Son (now King) though that great dignity was never intended to him by his Father, was called <hi>Sultan Caroom,</hi> or the Prince of bounty. His fourth <hi>Sultan Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>har,</hi> or the Prince of <hi>fame.</hi> His fift, and laſt Son was called by him <hi>Sultan Tauct, Tauct</hi> in the <hi>Perſian</hi> tongue, ſignifies a <hi>Throne,</hi> and he was named ſo by the King his Father, becauſe the firſt hour he ſat peaceably on his Throne, there was news brought him of that Sons birth.</p>
               <p>The firſt Son of that King, which he hath by any of his <hi>married wives,</hi> by prerogative of birth, inherits that <hi>Empire,</hi> the eldeſt Son of every man (as before) called there <hi>(the great brother.)</hi> And he that inherits that Monarchy, doth not openly ſlaughter his younger brothers, as the <hi>Turks</hi> do; yet it is obſerved, that few younger brothers of thoſe <hi>Indoſtan</hi> Kings have long <hi>ſurvived</hi> their <hi>Fathers.</hi>

               <p>

Yet notwithſtanding that long continued cuſtom there for the eldeſt Son to ſucceed the Father in that great Empire; <hi>Achabar Sha,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of that late King; upon high &amp; juſt diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure taken againſt his Son, <hi>for climbing up unto the bed of Anarkelee,</hi> his Fathers moſt beloved Wife (whoſe name ſignified the <hi>Kernel</hi> of a <hi>Pomegranate)</hi> and for other baſe actions of his, which ſtirred up his Fathers high diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt him, reſolved to break that ancient cuſtom, and therefore often in his life time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted, that not he, but his Grand-childe <hi>Sultan Coobſurroo,</hi> whom he always kept in his Court, ſhould ſucceed him in that Empire.</p>
               <p>And now by the way, the manner of that <hi>Achabar Sha</hi> his death (as they report it in <hi>India)</hi> is worthy obſervation.

His Father (the late <hi>Mogol)</hi> was thus acknowledged at <hi>Agra.</hi> Two great Armies were preſently levied, and meet together to decide the controverſie, and the generality of the people within that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, thinking it meet that the Father ſhould be King before the Son, clave by far, more to him then to his Son, by which means <hi>Sultan Coob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurroo</hi> was defeated and taken priſoner, and a very great many of young Gallants with him, whereof his Father immediately after cauſed to

Notwithaſtanding, the King ſpared his life, caſting him into Priſon where his eyes were ſealed up (by ſomething put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them which might not be taken of) for the ſpace of three years, after what time that ſeal was taken away, that he might with freedom enjoy the Light, though not his Liberty. And after his Father had taken him out of Priſon, he kept him alwaies near about him, but with a very ſtrong guard upon him, ſo that he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the King his Father in his Progreſſes, we ſometimes ſaw him. And once he called my Lord Ambaſſadour to him as we paſſed by him, asking him many queſtions, as how far diſtant our Country was from them, and what we brought thither, and what we carried thence, and how the King his Father had u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

him ſince his arrive there, whither or no he had not beſtowed upon him ſome great gifts. The Ambaſſadour told him that his buſineſs there was to obtain a free trade for his Nation the Engliſh, and that being granted him, he had reward enough. The Prince replyed that this could not be denyed us, we coming ſo far to trade there with him; and the Prince further asked him how long he had been there, the Ambaſſadour told him about two years, the Prince replyed again, that it was a very great ſhame for the ſucceſſor of <hi>Tamberlane,</hi> who had ſuch infinite Rules, to ſuffer a man of his quality to come ſo far unto him, and to live ſo long about him, and not to give him ſome Royall gift; and he further added that for himſelf he was a Priſoner, and therefore could do him no good but he would pray for him, and ſo he departed.</p>
               <p>For that Prince, he was a Gentleman of a very lovely preſence and fine carriage, ſo excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly beloved of the common people, that as <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

It was generally beleeved to be the intent of his Father (for he would often preſage ſo) to make this Prince his firſt-born his ſucceſſor, though for the preſent out of ſome jealouſie (his being ſo much beloved of the people) he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed his liberty.</p>

But for the Jeſuits there.</p>
               <p>There was one of that order in <hi>Goa</hi> (a City of the Portugals lying in the skirts of India) of very much fame and renown called <hi>Jerony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Xauere,</hi> ſent for by <hi>Achabar Sha</hi> the late Kings Father in the year 1596. to argue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him the doctrine of Chriſtianity, there being alwaies preſent a <hi>Moolaa</hi> or Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan Prieſt, and a third perſon, who followed no preciſe rule, but what the light of nature meerly led him to, and theſe two were to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject what they could againſt his reaſoning.</p>
               <p>The Jeſuit in the <hi>Mogols</hi> own language (which was a great advantage to him) began
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:115803:240"/>
to ſpeak firſt of the Creation, and then of the fall of man, in which the Mahometans agree with us.</p>
               <p>Then he layd down divers grounds to bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom his reaſonings on.</p>
               <p>That man by Creation was made a moſt excellent Creature, indued with the light of reaſon, which no other ſublunary Creature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelf had; then</p>
               <p>That man thus endued, muſt have ſome rule or Law to walk by, which he could not preſcribe unto himſelf, and therefore it muſt be given him from above.</p>
               <p>That this Law was firſt given unto man from God, and afterward confirmed by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſent into the world, in divers ages from God.</p>
               <p>That this Law thus delivered muſt needs be one Law, in all things agreeing in it ſelf. And ſo did not the Law of Mahomet.</p>
               <p>That this thus delivered was moſt confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to right reaſon; And ſo was not the Law of Mahomet.</p>
               <p>That man fall'n from God by Sin was not able to recover himſelf from that fall, and therefore it was neceſſary that there ſhould be one, more than a man to do it for him, and that that one could not be Mahomet.</p>
               <p>That this one was, Chriſt God, as well as man, God to ſatisfie (the Mahometans them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:115803:240"/>
confeſſing that Chriſt was the breath of God) and man to ſuffer death as he did.</p>
               <p>That Chriſt the Son of God coming into the world, about that great work of ſatisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Gods anger againſt man for ſin, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that he ſhould live a poor and labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life here on Earth (at which the Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans much ſtumble) and not a life that was full of pomp, and pleaſure, and delicacie.</p>
               <p>That the Goſpel of Chriſt, and other holy Books of Scripture, which the Chriſtians re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and walk by, contain nothing in them that is corrupt and depraved; But there is very much to be found in their Alcaron which is ſo.</p>
               <p>That the great worth and worthineſs ſhining in the perſon of Chriſt, was by far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than any thing obſervable in Mahomet (for they themſelves confeſs that Chriſt lived without ſin, when Mahomet himſelf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, that he had been a filthy perſon.)</p>
               <p>That the feigned and fooliſh, and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous miracles, which they ſay were done by Mahomet, were nothing comparable to the miracles done by Chriſt, who (as the Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans confeſs) did greater miracles than ever were done before or ſince him.</p>
               <p>That there was a great deal of difference in the manner of promulgating the Goſpel of Chriſt, into the world, and the introducing of the Laws of Mahomet.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="444" facs="tcp:115803:241"/>
That Chriſt hath purchaſed Heaven for all that beleeve in him, and that Hell is prepared for all others that do not rely on him, and on him alone for Salvation.</p>
               <p>There were many more particulars beſides theſe, which that <hi>Jeronymo Xaucere</hi> laid down before the <hi>Mogol</hi> to ground his arguments on, which that King heard patiently at ſeverall times during the ſpace of one year and half, but at laſt he ſent him away back again to <hi>Goa</hi> honourably, with ſome good gifts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on him, telling him as <hi>Felix</hi> did, after he had reaſoned before him, <hi>that he would call for him again when he had a convenient time,</hi> Acts 24. 25. Which time or ſeaſon neither of them both ever found afterward.</p>
               <p>Theſe particulars which I have here inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (with many more I might have added to them, upon all which that <hi>Jeronymo Xaucere</hi> enlarged himſelf before the <hi>Mogol</hi> in his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guings before him) were given unto me in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine by <hi>Franciſco Corſi,</hi> another Jeſuit reſident at that Court, while I was there, and long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that time.

               <p>For that <hi>Franciſco Corſi</hi> he was a <hi>Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> by birth, aged about fifty years, who (if he were indeed what he ſeemed to be) was a
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:115803:241"/>
man of a ſevere life, yet of a fair and an affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſpoſition: He lived at that Court, as an Agent for the Portugals, and had not onely free acceſs unto that King, but alſo encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and help by gifts, which he ſometimes beſtowed on him.</p>
               <p>When this Jeſuit came firſt to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with my Lord Ambaſſadour, he told him that they were both by profeſſion Chriſtians, though there was a vaſt difference betwixt them in their profeſſing of it. And as he ſhould not go about to reconcile the Ambaſſadour to them: So he told him that it would be labour in vain if he ſhould attempt to reconcile him to us. Onely he deſired, that there might be a fair correſpondency betwixt them, but no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes. And further his deſire was that thoſe wide differences 'twixt the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and us might not be made there to appear, that Chriſt might not ſeem by thoſe differences to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided amongſt men profeſſing Chriſtianity, which might be a very main obſtacle, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance unto his great deſign and endeavour, for which he was ſent thither, to convent peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple unto Chriſtianity there. Telling my Lord Ambaſſadour further, that he ſhould be ready to do for him all good offices of love and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice there, and ſo he was.</p>
               <p>After his firſt acquaintance, he viſited us often, uſually once a week. And as thoſe of
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:115803:242"/>
that ſociety, in other parts of the world are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great intelligencers: ſo was he there know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all news which was ſtirring and might be had, which he communicated unto us.</p>
               <p>And he would tell us many ſtories beſide, one of which, if true, is very remarkeable. And it was thus; there are a race of people in Eaſt India, the men of which race have (if he told us true) their right legges extraordinary great and miſhapen, their left legges are like other mens. Now he told us, that they were the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity of thoſe who ſtamped St. <hi>Thomas the Apoſtle to death,</hi> come thither to Preach the Goſpel, and that ever ſince the men of tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Jeſuits in Eaſt-India (for he was not alone there) have liberty to convert, any they can work upon, unto Chriſtianity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the <hi>Mogol</hi> hath thus far declared, that it ſhall be lawfull for any one, perſwaded ſo in conſcience, to become a Chriſtian, and that he ſhould not by ſo doing loſe his favour.</p>
               <p>Upon which, I have one thing, here to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, which I had there by report (yet I was bid

               <p>The <hi>Mogol</hi> then began to deal with him another way, asking him why he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wiſer than his fore-Fathers, who lived and dyed Mahometans, and further added many promiſes of riches and honour, if he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to his Mahometiſm, he replyed again as they ſay (for I have all this by tradition) that he would not accept of any thing in the world ſo to do; The <hi>Mogol</hi> wondring at his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy told him, that if he could have frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or bought him out of his new profeſſion, he would have made him an example for all wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers; but now he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The late <hi>Mogol</hi> about the beginning of his reign, cauſed a temple to be built in <hi>Agra,</hi> his chief City, for the Jeſuits, wherein two of his
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:115803:243"/>
younger Brothers Sons were ſolemnly Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and delivered into their hands to be tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned up in Chriſtianity, the young Gentleman growing to ſome ſtature (after they had had their tuition for ſome years) deſired them to provide them wives out of Chriſtendome fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Birth, in which having not ſuddain content, they gave up their Crucifixes again into the Jeſuits hands, and ſo left them; who had theſe conjectures upon this their revolt, that either the King their Unkle cauſed them to be Baptized; to make them more odious to the Mahometans, being ſo near of his blood; Or elſe it was his plot to get them beautifull wives out of <hi>Europe,</hi> which himſelf meant to take if he had liked them.</p>
               <p>The Jeſuit I laſt named <hi>Franciſco Corſi</hi> upon a time (at our being there) having his houſe, amongſt very many more conſumed by a ſuddain fire, it ſo was that his wooden Croſs, ſet on a Pole near the ſide of his houſe, was not (as he ſaid) conſumed. Upon which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently repayred to that Court, carried that Croſs with him, and told the King thereof. The Prince <hi>Sultan Caroome</hi> (who was no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer of the Chriſtians) being then preſent, and hearing him talk how his Croſs was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, derided him, ſaying, that it was one of his fabulous miracles, and further added, that he would have a fire preſently made before the
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:115803:243"/>
King, whereinto he would have that Croſs caſt, and if it conſumed not, his Father himſelf, and all the people there would preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chriſtians, but if it did himſelf ſhould be burnt with it. The Jeſuit not willing to put himſelf upon ſo ſuddain and ſo hot a tryall, anſwered that he durſt not tempt God, who was not tyed to times, and it might be that Almighty God, would never ſhew that people that infinite favour to make them Chriſtians, or if he had ſuch a great mercy for them in ſtore, it might be that the time of manifeſting it was not yet come, and therefore if he ſhould now ſubmit to that tryall, and Almighty God not pleaſe to ſhew a further and a preſent mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, his Religion would ſuffer prejudice there for ever after and therefore he refuſed.</p>
               <p>It ſhould ſeem that the Jeſuits there do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly extoll the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> which I have gathered from poor people there, natives of that Country, who have often asked Alms of me, when I ſtirred abroad amongſt them, and whereas one hath deſired me to give him ſome relief for Chriſts ſake, there are many who have begged it for the Virgin <hi>Maries</hi> ſake.</p>
               <p>Well known it is, that the Jeſuits there, who like the Pha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

of their great Converſions of Infidels in Eaſt India; but all theſe boaſtings are but reports; the truth is that they have there ſpilt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious water of Baptiſm upon ſome few Faces, working upon the neceſſity of ſome poor men, who for want of means, which they give them, are contented to wear Crucifixes; but for want of knowledge in the Doctrine of Chriſtianity are onely in Name Chriſtians. So that the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits Congregations there are very thin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of ſome Italians, which the <hi>Mogol</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertains (by great pay given them) to cut his Diamonds and other Rich ſtones. And of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther European ſtrangers which come thither, and ſome few others of the Natives before mentioned.

               <p>When I lived in thoſe parts it was my earneſt deſire and daily prayer, to have put my weak hands unto that moſt acceptable; but hard labour of waſhing Moors, that the Name of Jeſus Chriſt might have been there enlarged (if God had pleaſed to honour me ſo far) by my endeavours.

profeſs themſelves Chriſtians (is a thought which cannot paſs by thoſe (who love and pray for the increaſe of Chriſts kingdom) without much ſorrow and ſadneſs to attend upon it.</p>
               <p>The Conſideration whereof (as of many other things, wherein the due and deſerved commendations, even of thoſe very Heathens reflects ſhame upon us) enforceth me, leaſt I ſhould be like thoſe Bottles, in <hi>Job 34. that were ready to burſt for want of vent;</hi> enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth me (I ſay) having my Pen in my hand to expatiate, and to let out my thoughts much further (I confeſs) than the rules and bounds proper to be obſerved in an Hiſtoricall Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can well bear.

And while I ſhall thus enlarge my ſelf, I would not be looked upon as one altogether out of my way, though I be here found more at home than abroad, more in <hi>England</hi> than <hi>India.</hi>

               <p>This Narrative in ſome foregoing paſſages hath taken notice of ſome Mahometan pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, as of others delivered by thoſe Heathens, to be as Rules for their followers to walk by.</p>
               <p>Now for the Doctrin of Chriſtianity which
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:115803:247"/>
we profeſs, <hi>it is that which teacheth a man to look for true and eternall happineſs by Chriſt alone, there being no other Name under Heaven given amongſt men, whereby they may be ſaved.</hi> Acts 4. 12. No way under Heaven, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by and through Chriſt Jeſus and by him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. And therefore we muſt not look after another new way, as for a new Chriſt, a new paſſion, a new reſurrection or the like. And here Reader let us ſit down a little, and ſuffer our thoughts to be taken up with that, I called before matter of ſerious, and ſad, I and of admirable conſideration.</p>
               <p>They who have curiouſly ſurveyed the world, and the ſeverall Nations which inhabits it, have divided the Inhabitants thereof into thirty parts, whereof nineteen are Heathens; ſix are Mahometans, and five are Chriſtians, by which account (and I conceive that there is a good proportion in it) if all the people which poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the whole face of the earth were numbred, there would be but one in ſix, ſo much as to bear the name of a Chriſtian. And to make up this Number, we muſt take in all Chriſts retainers throughout the world, who do but bear his Name, as well as thoſe which be his houſehold Servants.</p>
               <p>As all thoſe poor ſuperſtitious blind Abiſſins in <hi>Ethyopia,</hi> as alſo all thoſe which inhabite <hi>Georgia,</hi> and the two <hi>Armenia</hi>'s, under the
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:115803:247"/>
Tyranny of the Turk and King of <hi>Perſia</hi> (of whom ſomething before in my firſt Section) now with ſome of thoſe poor ſouls I have conferred, and could never hear any thing from them unto any purpoſe, onely they would tell me they were <hi>Chriſtiano's,</hi> but why they were ſo, I perſwade my ſelf that they could not render any thing like a good reaſon, their whole Chriſtianity, I fear almoſt all of it, lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged (as before) in their very Name.</p>
               <p>To theſe we muſt adde the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> and the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> who are moſt ſottiſhly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, for one of their Churchmen, being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked how many Evangeliſts there were, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that he did not well know, but he thought four, and when others have been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked ſuch obvious and eaſy queſtions, that a very child might make anſwer too, they would reply, that they could not give an anſwer unto it themſelves, But God and their great Duke knew all things. Now as they are a moſt ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant. ſo are they a moſt treacherous, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, filthy and an Idolatrous people.</p>
               <p>But further all thoſe beſide that bear the Names of Chriſtians in the world, as the <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites</hi> and the <hi>Maronites</hi> inhabiting <hi>Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtina,</hi> the Greek and the Romiſh Church, with all others bearing that name, muſt be added to make up that number before ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>And now to come unto the Reformed
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:115803:248"/>
Churches (or rather unto thoſe which call themſelves ſo) how few amongſt them are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians indeed; who are ſo in name; when we may run through many Congregations, as the Prophet <hi>Jeremy, was commanded to run through</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 1. And not find a man a Chriſtian in earneſt and indeed, as well as in Name ſo.</p>
               <p>I confeſs that it is nothing, or at leaſt no hard matter for a man profeſſing Chriſtianity to act Religion, to play devotion, to appear excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent upon the Stage, as the Phariſees did, to be all for ſhew, nothing for ſubſtance, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the praiſe of men, as the Phariſees did, and to get the praiſe of men, and this is all Hypocrites can look for. And I know that the worſt of men may ſometimes be in good moodes. But as good thoughts are long before they come into bad hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo they continue not long, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king but a through fare in them, being like a Poſt that paſſeth by.</p>

In the 1 K. 21. you may ſee <hi>Ahab</hi> upon his knees, but all that he ſhewed was but the viſard of ſorrow, not the face, or if the face, not the heart, or if the ſorrow of the heart, not the repentance, a ſorrow for the judgement, not a repentance for the ſin. <hi>The

Called by one or two out of a City or tribe. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3. 4.</p>
               <p>Now if we put all this together; as firſt, that there is no way, no means to attain ſalvation, but onely in, and through Chriſt Jeſus. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly that there be very few in the world which do, in reſpect of thoſe, which do not ſo much as bear the Names of Chriſtians.

               <p>Alas poor Indians, who live in darkneſs and in the ſhadow of death and cannot help it but wo be to Chriſtians, who have light to walk by and will not improve it; for the firſt of theſe they cannot know, for the ſecond they care not to know, they will not know, which makes them more excuſable, becauſe there is no plea for the willfull.</p>
               <p>Many Indians, poor ſouls! walk in that little light they have, unreproveably in reſpect of moralites, and doubtleſs, if they knew bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, would do better (though I am perſwaded, that God will never honour Jeſuits ſo far, as to convert them unto Chriſtianity, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their great brags of their many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts there) but what can be ſaid in excuſe of thoſe, who profeſs themſelves Chriſtians, and live amongſt ſo many clear viſions yet even there do ſo ſhut up their eyes againſt their light, as that they know nothing in Religion as they ought to know it.</p>
               <p>Therefore, if we leave thoſe Indians a while, and come home unto our ſelves, who are col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively and together called all Chriſtians, we ſhall find that the ſucceſſion of times here amongſt us, have very much reſembled that Image, <hi>which</hi> Nebuchadnezzar <hi>ſaw in his

Oh how happy would thoſe eſteem themſelves to be, if they could but purchaſe with much price and more hazard, any part or parcell of the New Teſtament in that language they could underſtand it, how then would they have ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laced themſelves with that ſweet Companion. And if then they were put into Priſons for glorifying God, in the ſelf ſame priſon they glorified him more, and were willing to run as faſt to Martyrdom, as people in theſe days to pleaſure, or Covetouſneſs; were as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall of their lives in the ſervice of God, as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are of their money now in the ſervice of their luſts, ſuffering then more willingly for Chriſt Jeſus, than moſt are now to ſpeak of him, or for him.

Or they come to hearing the word, as if (like <hi>Malchus</hi> the high Prieſts ſervant) they had their right ears ſtrook off, for they hear not with judgement, but ſiniſterly, and often with prejudice to the perſon ſpeaking and to the doctrine delivered, be it never ſo excellent, and he that delivers it of much integrity and deſert. Such hearers as theſe regard not what is ſolid, ſubſtantiall, and of moſt uſe to informe the underſtanding, and to ſtir up the affections; but that which is delightfull, and pleaſant to feed the phancie, with Oylie paſſages, which like the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and bind others, for there is no hope in this caſe to work Convictions upon many, ſuch as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> calls <hi>the beaſts of the people,</hi> who would defraud us, if they could, of all our juſt rights. For doubtleſs if we were left wholy to their curteſie, we might expect no more, probably not ſo much from them as <hi>Micha gave his Levite</hi> Judg. 17. 10. <hi>ten Shekels of Slver by the year, and a little clothing, and victuals.</hi> Now thoſe <hi>Shekels</hi> were rated diverſly, ſome at fifteen pence, others at twenty pence, and the higheſt rate of them was two ſhillings and ſix pence the <hi>Shekel,</hi> but which of theſe <hi>Micha</hi> gave his Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len I cannot tell, neither can I ſay what our people in this Nation, left to themſelves, would generally give their Miniſter by a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary gift.</p>
               <p>But doubtleſs it would go very hard with many, with moſt, who if they were left alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unto their peoples feeding, would ſpeed little better than a yong <hi>Welſh-man</hi> of the univerſity of <hi>Oxford</hi> ſomtimes did (and I am very certain that the relation is true) who after he had gotten a lambe-skin upon his Shoulders, being Bacheler of Arts, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently went into the Countrey for preferments, (as he ſaid) and what he found was but four Pounds a year (as he told me) for
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:115803:256"/>
reading prayers in a Church, with liberty in the Belfary to teach a few Children, out of which he was to provide himſelf of food, and cloathing, and all other neceſſaries. I meeting him ſome half year after, he told me how he ſped, and that it was but ſmall, but ſmall, I asked the poor man further how he did make a ſhift to live, he told me, that he had been ſick of an Ague the greateſt part of that time, could take but little food, and if it had not been ſo with him, his preferment would have ſtarved him. And thus certainly would it be with many others, if they were left for their livelihood meerly to mens cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſies.</p>
               <p>Who think the bread of the Church ſweet, and therefore would eat it up all from us, and leave us with their good will no part thereof, and happily they may find or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine it ſweet in their mouths, but in their ſtomacks it will proove hard of digeſtion.

not, they will one day find enough mould in the grave, and enough fire in Hell.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Athenians</hi> (as <hi>Valerius</hi> reports) though they were Heathens, yet when <hi>Phydias</hi> was to make for them the jmage of <hi>Minerva,</hi> (which Goddeſſe as they call'd her, was in very high eſteem amongſt them) and when that work-man told them that he would make it for them either in Marble, or Ivory, they heard him thus far, but when he further adviſed them to have it made in <hi>Marble,</hi> becauſe that would be cheapeſt, they preſently commanded him ſilence, and put him out of doores.</p>
               <p>And if Heathens could not endure to entertain the thoughts of cheapneſs, though but in the making of an Idoll, let them of this Nation bluſh, and have their faces covered with ſhame, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be that love to ſerve God (as they call it) but to be at as little coſt in that ſervice as poſſibly they can, as if they ſtudied <hi>Jeroboams Politicks,</hi> whoſe Policie eat up his Religion, who after he had uſurped his Kingdom, did invent this taking ſnare to faſten the people unto him, in giving them ſome ſeeming immunity in the profeſſion of Religion, telling them

                  <hi>that it was too much for them to go to Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem to ſacrifice. 1 King.</hi> 12. 28.

               </p>
               <p>Again, <hi>further for that people, they do ſo highly prize thoſe books in which their lawes are written, that they know not how ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to eſteem and value them, and therefore will not preſume to touch them without much reverence.</hi> What ſhall I ſay, as to this, unto very-very many of this <hi>Nation,</hi> and ſuch as have long lived under the Miniſtry of the word, but having profited nothing by it, know not how to put any valuation on it, and therefore eſteem it a <hi>trouble,</hi> a <hi>burden,</hi> rather then a bleſſing or <hi>benefit,</hi> and conſequently would be very well content (ſo they might be freed from all charge to the publiſhers thereof) if the whole book of God were ſerved <hi>as that roll was,</hi> written by <hi>Baruch</hi> from the mouth of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet, <hi>Jer. 36. Cut all in peaces and burnt in the fire.</hi>

truth, but ſell it not. Buy</hi> it of <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> buy it of <hi>Books</hi> by <hi>reading,</hi> buy it of <hi>Orthodox</hi> men by hearing, buy it of other <hi>good Chriſtians</hi> by <hi>conferring,</hi> buy it over and over again, you cannot over buy it, <hi>Non Priamus tanti.</hi>—There is nothing in the world to be weighed againſt it, to be compared with it. <hi>But ſell it not for a world.</hi> Yet there are a great many dunghil men of the earth, who with <hi>Aeſops</hi> cock prefer a <hi>Barly</hi> Corne before the Pearle, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are moſt unwilling to part with a <hi>Penny</hi> for that moſt rich <hi>commodity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſtrange, further to conſider (as I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before) and is very true, that <hi>Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> ſhould never ſee their <hi>Alcoran</hi> (though but a fardle of falſhoods and fooleries) or hear any part of it read, without a <hi>ſhew</hi> of great <hi>attention, affection</hi> and <hi>reverence;</hi> and Heathens do ſo likewiſe at the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their precepts; and all of them give honour and maintenance which is comfortable and without grudging unto thoſe that be their Teachers: (though they lead them quite out of the way) and <hi>men</hi> dare to uſurp the names of <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and yet would be content (I would not be uncharitable in this ſad aſſertion) would be content (I ſay) ſo they might be at no charge for hearing the truths of God. If there were no book of God at all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:115803:258"/>
no Goſpel, no Miniſter to declare and publiſh it.</p>
               <p>But the time will one day come, when people. (if ever they return to a right knowledge of themſelves) who have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted ſo much <hi>thrift</hi> in the profeſſion of <hi>Religion,</hi> ſhal rue and repent the time that ever they did ſo. When they may deſire to ſee one day more <hi>of the Son of man, one day more of the Goſpels,</hi> which they ſo ſlighted before, but all in vain. <hi>When diſtreſs and anguiſh commeth upon them, then ſhall they call upon God, but he will not hear them</hi> &amp;c. the reaſon follows, <hi>becauſe they hated knowledg. Prov.</hi> 1. 27, 28. &amp;c. becauſe they <hi>hated</hi> and <hi>deſpiſed knowledge, as Eſau</hi> was ſaid to deſpiſe his <hi>birth-right,</hi> becauſe he put no greater <hi>valuation on it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I confeſſe that if we whoſe buſineſſe it is to teach and direct others, do not in the firſt place labour to <hi>teach</hi> and inſtruct our <hi>ſelves.</hi> If we be like the ſtatue of <hi>Mercury</hi> which pointed the way to others while it ſtood ſtill it ſelfe; Or like <hi>Watermen,</hi> that look <hi>forward</hi> while they Row and move <hi>backward.</hi> If we ſeduce or <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead</hi> our people, by <hi>Error,</hi> or <hi>Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> If we do not manifeſt <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> and <hi>pitty</hi> to our Congregations, but while we undertake the overſight of their <hi>ſouls,</hi> either ſilently or elſe in paſſion or

               </p>
               <p>Then thirdly, the very ſhameful neglect of other publike Perſons in their ſeveral places, as of <hi>Maſters</hi> in their <hi>Families,</hi> of <hi>Parents</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their <hi>Children,</hi> and laſtly of <hi>Miniſters</hi> in relation to their <hi>Flocks</hi> have been all of them, and are moſt ſadly miſcheivous in this Nation.</p>
               <p>I begin with the laſt I named, <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the word, many of which are too too <hi>careleſse</hi> their charges, in taking no conſiderable <hi>pains</hi> for what they deliver unto their <hi>people,</hi> but on the contrary by <hi>haſty</hi> and undegeſted meditations, <hi>offer unto God that which coſt them nothing;</hi> Or that preach as moſt hear, reſting meerly in the thing done.</p>

               </p>
               <p>A <hi>wiſe</hi> and faithful Miniſter of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> muſt conſider that he hath <hi>lambs</hi> in his <hi>flock</hi> as wel as <hi>ſheep,</hi> and therefore muſt fit his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe unto all the <hi>ſeveral capacities</hi> of his <hi>hearers,</hi> providing, as <hi>ſtrong meat</hi> for <hi>wel grown</hi> Chriſtians, ſo <hi>milk</hi> for <hi>Lambs</hi> and <hi>babes.</hi> And he muſt deale with theſe <hi>babes</hi> who are but newly entred into the <hi>ſchool of Chriſt,</hi> as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents do with their little children when they begin to <hi>ſpel</hi> or <hi>read,</hi> encourage and praiſe them, though what they do be not ſo praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy: ſo if he ſee any the leaſt ſpark of good in them, to blow it up, and not rigidly ſhut <hi>the dore of hope againſt</hi> thoſe, when God keeps it open; nor deſpiſe ſmal, the ſmalleſt things in who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>All Congregations then conſiſting of ſome very low and weak, as of others of more high and quicker capacities, thoſe who have the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſight of them muſt take ſpecial notice of this in applying themſelvs unto their ſeveral underſtandings accordingly. Which if ſo, I think they do very ill who do very much if not altogether neglect the Reading of the
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:115803:265"/>
holy Scriptures in their Congregations, as if that were not an <hi>Ordinance of God.</hi> And they are much to be blamed likewiſe who endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to feed their people with <hi>Sauce</hi> rather then <hi>food, as Ephraim fed on wind;</hi> Or as that Roman Emperour who ſeemed to entertain his gueſts with fleſh, and fowles, and fiſhes of divers kindes, the figures of all which were moſt exactly counterfeited in thin ſilver plate with paint put upon it, and preſented before them, which they might touch and admire, but they could not taſt, and much leſſe carry away: ſo theſe amuſe, trouble, and perplex many of the people whom they undertake to feed, with abſtruſe paſſages, or uncooth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, with high ſpeculations, or with aery notions, or with Metaphyſical terms, clouding and obſcuring many truths, while their buſineſſe is to explain them; for by new and unfit dreſſes put upon them, they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times make truths which are eaſy in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, more hard to be underſtood; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they themſelves may happily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their own meanings, conceive that their hearers muſt do ſo likewiſe, as if they were all in the upper form of Chriſtianity, and if they were, would be no more able to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand ſome paſſages preached and printed (though ſome women ſay that they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them very well) then the others were to eat of that Emperours diſhes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="493" facs="tcp:115803:265"/>
And as theſe high exalted notions are very uſeleſs (to ſay no more) in our Preachings, becauſe ſo few can reach them: ſo a too<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too much affected plaineneſs in them, which many times are preſented to hearers in ſuch unſeemly, and unpleaſing, if not abſurd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions (though I know that there is a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned plaineneſs, as well as a plain ignorance) as in probability will never give that infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to the underſtanding, nor that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and quickning to the affections, as may work upon both, or either. <hi>In all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour there is profit</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon Pr.</hi> 14. 23. which as it is true in earthly; ſo in ſpirituall things, where the Crown is reſerved for the diligent. And to what purpoſe hath the Spirit and wiſdom of God ſtrewed the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures over with the choiceſt flowers and figures of Rhetorick, &amp;c. with many full, but ſhort ſentences, if they were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether uſeleſs in our Preachings. In which we are commanded to uſe all arguments we can poſſibly invent, to perſwade men to take Chriſt and Salvation; and when theſe perſwaſions come from our hearts, as well as our heads, the greater pains we then take, and the more our diſcourſes are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and ſet off with Scripture Elegancies, the more ſuccesfull and prevayling we may hope they will prove.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="494" facs="tcp:115803:266"/>
They therefore (as I humbly conceive) judge very raſhly, and very much amiſs, who in diſpenſing the word, conclude nothing to be ſo ſpirituall, as that which is low, and flat, ſavouring of very little, or no pains, but is very idly, if not ignorantly performed.</p>

               <p>And then, for the comfort of all thoſe, who have been wiſe and faithfull in this their great truſt, and have done the utmoſt of their endeavours to do much good there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; although they have not gained a fair Seal to their Miniſtry by converting many ſouls to God, they ſhall be ſure of a full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, who have been thus faithfull, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever their ſucceſs hath been; that when their careleſs and unprofiting hearers, that he bound over unto the judgement ſeat of Chriſt, with this ſad teſtimony againſt them, <hi>Noluerunt incantari;</hi> this or that people would not be admoniſhed, they ſhall receive a <hi>Quietus eſt,</hi> from that great and high Tribunal, which ſhall ſpeak thus, <hi>well done good and faithfull ſervant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſecond great cauſe of the many grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evils amongſt us, proceeds very much from the great neglect and remiſneſs of Maſters, or Governours of Families, who do not take care as they might, as they ought to keep in order thoſe under their roofs, and to nurture them up in the fear of the Lord. For examples herein have much power in them to ſway either to good or evill. And the greater the example is, the
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:115803:267"/>
greater hope if it be good, but if evill the greater danger; for greatneſs hath ever a train to follow it, either in good or evill. <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were great examples of good herein, as he that turns to their ſtories may clearly ſee.</p>
               <p>But on the other ſide <hi>Jeroboam</hi> is ſeldom mentioned in the writers of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but he draws a tayl after him like a Blazing Star, <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the Son of <hi>Nebat,</hi> who did not onely ſin himſelf, but made <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin 1 <hi>K.</hi> 14. 16. by whoſe high precedency, but evil example, he did exceeding much miſchief ſo defiling his Throne, that if ye look for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upon all the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, you ſhall not find amongſt them all one good man. <hi>Omnes ad unum</hi> from <hi>Jeroboam</hi> the firſt to <hi>Hoſhea</hi> the laſt King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> they were all nought. Now they who were ſo bad in the Government of a Kingdom, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt could not be good in the well ordering of a family.</p>
               <p>And hence let all know that as they may do much good, and conſequently reap much comfort, in the true managing of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies: ſo on the contrary they ſhall be ſure one day to ſuffer, and that heavily for the diſorder of them, when they ſhall be called to a ſtrict account, not onely for their own
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:115803:267"/>
ſins, but ſor the ſins of others, under their charge, who by their precedency and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they have drawn into, or elſe by their connivency ſuffered in wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>A third (and that ſhall be laſt cauſe I will name of ſo much increaſe of wickedneſs in this Nation, and becauſe it is ſo deſtructive and miſchievous, I ſhall ſpeak more largely to it) is the great careleſneſs of Parents in their not looking to their Children in their firſt inſtitution and breeding; for without all doubt the very ſad miſcarriages of all ſorts of Children, of higher and meaner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction or deſcent, proceed very much from their firſt ordering; when many Parents quite undoe their Children, <hi>ſtulto &amp; impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo amore;</hi> by reaſon of their fooliſh indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, the great ſin of <hi>Eli</hi> (before ſpoken of) who brought up his Sons to bring down his houſe; who, for giving them their way too much, was ſaid, <hi>to honour his Sons more than God.</hi> So <hi>David</hi> after him was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved over much to indulge his Son <hi>Abſolon,</hi> when he was young, and to requite him for this ill breeding, <hi>Abſolon</hi> lives heavily to vex his Father <hi>Davia</hi> when his Father was old.</p>
               <p>The Children of many Parents (eſpecially of great ones) bred when they are young at
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:115803:268"/>
home or abroad, are very often left too much unto their own will, to learn or elſe to do almoſt what themſelves pleaſe, when get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting few, or no grounds of learning in their youth or non-age, ſuddainly after many of them travell, and then wanting for the moſt part good guides for their youth, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abroad firſt ſee nought, and then be nought, and after all this without ſpeciall mercy, they dye nought.</p>
               <p>I do not deny but that there may be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many good experiences gaind by travell, but very few do, in reſpect of thoſe, which do not improve that advantage: whence it often comes to paſs, when a great number of theſe come to write themſelves men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unable to read Books for want of thoſe principles of learning they might have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; and unwilling to ſettle themſelves in other good imployments, whereby they might be enabled to give a fair account of their precious time, they often learn to drink, and ſwear, and rant, and game, and Court Women (to ſpeak it in the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteſt ſenſe) or to ſpoyl good Clothes, they reſolving to enjoy the pleaſures that are preſent, as if they had been born to no other end but to ſit down, <hi>and to eat and drink, and to riſe up to play.</hi>

<pb n="500" facs="tcp:115803:269"/>
of one hour; for they muſt aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that when their meal is ended, a great and heavy reckoning will follow.</p>
               <p>Of all the Ages of men there is no time of life whereon we may ground more hope, and more fear than in Child-hood and youth. And therefore thoſe Parents, who would have comfort in their Children, muſt look very carefully to their firſt ſeaſoning; For as it was the Policy of the King of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, Dan.</hi> 1. 4. to have the Children of the Jews, and not the old men to be taught the language of the Chaldeans: ſo it is the ſubtilty of the Divell, to have Children, while they are very young, traynd up in ſtrange language, and to have them corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with evill habits, which may make them, like a veſſell, that hath ill liquor put into it at the firſt, taſt of their firſt ſeaſoning while life remaineth.</p>
               <p>That dangerous time of youth, by the envy, and cunning, and help of Satan, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries very many young men left too much unto themſelves into moſt ſhameful courſes, They being of themſelves like a Ship on the maine Ocean, that hath neither Helm, nor compaſs, and therefore moves it knows not whither. Or in this, like weak limb'd Children, who, if they be ſuffered to go too
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:115803:269"/>
much, and to ſoon, lame themſelves for ever.</p>
               <p>Yet many think that in that time of life, their youth gives them ſome liberty and priviledge, <hi>aliquid aetati juvenum eſt conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum,</hi> they ſay, which words abuſed, make them the Divels diſpenſation, and not Gods; though they may fondly and falſly ſuppoſe, that becauſe they are young, they may be borne withall in any thing they do, as if Pride, Drunkenneſs, Whoredome, and the like moſt fearfull exorbitances, were not faults in youth, they not conſidering that want of years and want of judgement (which judgement enables to put a right difference 'twixt good and evill) uſually go together. And that youth is like unto green wood, which is ever ſhrinking and warping; for <hi>as with the antient there is wiſdom,</hi> Job. 12. 12. ſo pampered and ungoverned youth is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly raſh, heady, inſolent, wedded to its own will, led by humour, a rebell to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a ſubject to paſſion, fitter to execute than to adviſe: and becauſe youth cannot conſider, as it ſhould, it is no marvell if it ſo often miſcarry. The ways of youth being ſteep, and ſlippery, wherein it is very hard to ſtand, as very eaſy to fall, and to run into moſt fearful exorbitances: It being the uſual
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:115803:270"/>
manner of young men, ſo much to intend (as they falſly think) the love of themſelves in the love of their pleaſures, as that they cannot attend the love of God. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that man may much better hope to come ſafely and happily unto the end of his courſe, who hath paſſed over his firſt jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney (I mean his youth) well,</p>
               <p>But (which is a very great hinderance unto many young men, when they do but begin to enter upon their way) there are many Parents which do not deſire, that their Children ſhould be good betimes, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſled by one of the Devils Proverbs, which is <hi>a young Saint an old Devill.</hi> It is true, that ſome, who have been wild and wicked in youth, have proved good in age: But it is a moſt tryed truth, to encourage the groth of early holineſs, which hath been made good by much experience, that <hi>a Saint in youth, an Angell in age.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And truly very many Children may thank their Parents for much of the evill that is in them, beſide their Birth-ſin, poyſoning them (as they do) by their evill examples.

                  <p>But why Parents thus generally fail in

                  <p>It is not to be hoped that Parents ſhould give their Children better precepts than they have learn'd themſelves.</p>
                  <p>But here I muſt prevent an objection, and 'tis this. That if Parents be not wanting in their duty herein, it is not al the care they can poſſibly have, which of it ſelf can make good Children. For how many good Children have fall'n from bad Loins: And how many gracious Parents (to their greateſt grief) have been the Fathers and Mothers of moſt untoward Children. The reaſon is, becauſe goodneſs doth not like lands and goods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from Parents to Children, for God will be the free giver and beſtower of all his Graces, <hi>and will have mercy, on whom he will have mercy.</hi> So then if our Children be good, we muſt thank God for that; if evill they may thank us and themſelves, us for their

birth-ſin, and many times for more of their evill then ſo (as before:) themſelves, for the improvement of that evill in the ways of wickedneſs.</p>
                  <p>However we may conclude this as a rule, that thoſe Children of all others, (in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities) are like to prove beſt, who have been beſt ſeaſoned in their young years; <hi>for train up a Child in the way he ſhould go, and when he is old, he will not depart from it,</hi> Pr. 22. 6.</p>
                  <p>In the wars 'twixt <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> there was a little Maid of <hi>Iſrael</hi> taken by the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians 2 Kings</hi> 5. and ſhe was put to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wife of <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian.</hi> That <hi>Naaman</hi> was a great man with his Maſter the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> and honourable, ſaith the ſtory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he was a Leaper, and that ſtain of Leproſie ſauced all his greatneſs ſo much, that the pooreſt man in <hi>Syria</hi> would not have changed place with him, to have had his skin to boot. There is no greatneſs that can exempt a man from the moſt loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and weariſome conditions: doubtleſs that Leproſie, muſt needs be a grievous bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to that great Peer. The Maid of <hi>Iſrael</hi> tells her Miſtriſs, would God my Lord were with the Prophet which is in <hi>Samaria,</hi> for he would recover him of his Leproſie Her
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:115803:272"/>
Miſtriſs preſently tells her Lord, who upon this report immediately repayr unto that Prophet, and is healed of his diſeaſe. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that ſtorie to this end, that it is very good for Parents to acquaint their Children while they be young with the knowledge of God and of his Prophets, for we do not know what great good they may do by it, The generall neglect of which, and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other duties of Parents, for the good and welfare of their Children, as the great faylings of others (I have named) in their ſeverall relations, are principal, and moſt apparent cauſes of the diſtemper and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the whole Body of this Nation, even from the ſole of the foot, unto the Crown of the head.</p>

                  <p>God hath had a Church long planted in this Nation, and I dare ſay that ſince the Goſpell hath been publiſhed to the world, it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver preached with more Power than it hath been here in theſe later times; As for our Fore-fathers, they inſtead of the food of life, iſſuing from the two breaſts of the Church, the Law and the Goſpels, were made to feed on moudly &amp; fennowed Traditions.

                  <p>I ſhall ſpeak it again, under how many ſad diſcouragements have many able ſober minded, and orthodox Miniſters of the Goſpel laboured in theſe later times, who as if they had not enemies enough abroad, find them at home in their own houſe, their own coat, <hi>proprijs pennis configimur,</hi> wounded we are by our own quills, by ſome who are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent at cloſe bites, and though they ſpeak us fair, can open their mouths as wide againſt us as any others, and then when we deſerve nothing but well.

they were deaf, and underſtanding they underſtood nothing as they ought to have done it. So for outvvard things, though they have abundance, yet they have nothing, becauſe they have not God, in the right knowledge and underſtanding of him, as he ought to be known in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

                  <p>The truth, and power of Religion, I ſay, for there have been ever many miſconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings about Religion. How many ſtirs, and quarrels, and Heats have we known about the liſt, and fringe of Chriſts Garment, (as one of moſt high deſerving long ſince obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) and theſe miſtakes in Religion have made many to agree no better than the Bricklayers of <hi>Babel,</hi> who when their tongues were divided could not underſtand one anothers ſpeech, but did miſtake one thing for another; And thus do many now who take nature (if but a little refined) for Grace; Will for Conſcience. So a floa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting knowledge for true wiſdom, cruelty for Juſtice, covetouſneſs for frugality, baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for humility, preſumption for hope, a
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:115803:288"/>
diſtempered heat for true zeal, and vaine cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity for faith. And the reaſon of all this is, becauſe the beſt Graces have their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits, and from hence come thoſe many miſtakes.</p>
                  <p>Now for the power and truth of Religion we ſhall the better know it, if we firſt briefly diſcover what it is not, and then what it is. What it is not; It doth not conſiſt in a bare hearing of the word, though heard never ſo frequently, nor in a bare performance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther duties, which are good in themſelves, though praiers perform'd ne'r ſo conſtantly; long prayers wil not excuſe the devouring of vvidovvs houſes, nor the doing of other good duties, any the like acts of oppreſſion and violence. Thou Preacheſt, thou heareſt, thou readeſt, thou prayeſt, but how liveſt thou? what doeſt thou? if theſe queſtions cannot be well reſolved, all good perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances will prove nothing worth.</p>
                  <p>Again, the power and truth of Religion is not manifeſted in a raſh cenſuring and condemning of others, I am not as other men are, nor as this Publican (you know who ſaid it.) It doth not conſiſt in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alting of a mans ſelf above others, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his gifts and graces are. It is not to be found meerly in an ability to talk or
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:115803:289"/>
prattle, or diſpute, or wrangle, and after to hold the concluſion, whatſoever may be ſaid againſt it in the premiſes.</p>
                  <p>But for the truth and power of Religion, if we would briefly, and in ſome particulars know what it is, it is that which makes a man labour firſt to know, and then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and to do whatſoever is to be bele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ved and to be done, but to believe and do rather than to know. It is that which makes a man put a better eſteem upon others than upon himſelf. It is that which puts a guard on the lips, a bridle on the tongue, a cu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ing through Gods purity its ovvn vileneſs. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man (in vvhom the truth and povver of Religion ſhines) vvhen he hears of ſinners, borrovvs the Apoſtles language, and ſaith of himſelf, that I am the chief, for he kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping a continuall guard and vvatch over him<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <l>We ſeek a Country, cannot find it here,</l>
               <l>Here in this Pilgrimage, i'th whole world, where</l>
               <l>The ſtreighteſt, ſmootheſt paths, which moſt do pleaſe,</l>
               <l>Are clog'd with toyl and trouble; but want eaſe.</l>
               <l>Our God, and Country too are both above,</l>

               <l>For though he could with weary paces get</l>

               <l>Andafter many days ſtill cry'd go onne.</l>
               <l>Who follows cloſe Gods call, and way runs beſt,</l>
               <l>Till he receives his penny, take his reſt.</l>
