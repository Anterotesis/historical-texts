            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE to the Friendly Reader.</head>
            <p>THE chief occaſion I have of Writing this ſhort Preface to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Treatiſe, is to excuſe the delay of Publiſhing it until now, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing declared my purpoſe of doing ſuch a thing in a Printed Treatiſe, called, <hi>The True Copy of a Paper given into the Yearly Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with a ſhort Liſt of ſome of the groſs and vile Errors of</hi> G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was Publiſhed above a Year ago, and to Anſwer the Objection that ſome make, why I ſhould expoſe the Errors of theſe Men, before I did Correct my own? To both which I thus Anſwer briefly. To the Firſt I ſay, Upon an after Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of my Books, I then mentioned in that Treatiſe, I found divers more Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages that needed an Explanation, and ſome of them a Correction, above what I had diſcovered when I publiſhed my ſaid purpoſe, and I thought it was more proper to do both at once, then to Publiſh one Part before another. But indeed the Whole might have been much ſooner Publiſhed, had not the great Brags of my late Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, telling what great matters of Contradictions, and other Abſurdities, they had found in my Books, juſtly occaſioned a longer delay, that I might ſee the Sum Total of what they had to charge me with, which at laſt is come out againſt me in ſeveral late Printed Books of my Adverſaries, as of <hi>Thomas Elwood, John Penington,</hi> and <hi>Edward Penington;</hi> but having diligently peruſed them all, I find nothing material in them, juſtly chargeable, but what I had much more charged my ſelf with, and had Corrected before; beſide that, moſt of the Things I have Corrected and Retracted in my Books, they have ſo paſt them over, that they have not put the leaſt Cenſure on them. And the Contradictions and Abſurdities they would faſten on me, are nothing, for the far greateſt part, but their own blind Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and perverſions of my ſound Words, proceeding from their great Ignorance. What are otherwiſe, are my own Obſervations, and free Acknowledgments, without any aſſiſtance I had from their inſignificant and ſelf-contradictory Scriblings. And that they may demonſtrate their Itch to Scribble, they have filled a great many Sheets with repeating the ſame things over, again, and again, with very little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and what is ſo, is almoſt wholly either a manifeſt perverſion of my Words, or a palpable bewraying their Ignorance and Folly, which I may (if God permit) in divers particulars hereafter diſcover (it not being proper in this place) above the particular Inſtances I have given in the following Treatiſe. And this I hope will ſuffice to Apologiſe for this ſmall delay, and will be a reaſonable Excuſe to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Men, and may ſerve to ſtop the Mouths of my Adverſaries alſo, who have taken as much time, and perhaps more, to publiſh Anſwers to Books that they have ſaid they would Anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:66443:3"/>
To the <hi>Second</hi> I Anſwer. Firſt, My free Acknowledgment that there were things in my Books that did need Correcting, and my declaring my purpoſe with the firſt convenience to Correct them, might excuſe me for my not beginning with my own Books, until I had either brought them to give an equal Acknowledgment of their need of Correcting their Books, or upon their ſtubborn and pertinacious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of their Books being free of all Erros, I might the more juſtly expoſe them, not only to be guilty of Errors, but that they hold them pertinaciouſly. <hi>Secondly,</hi> As I ſaid before in the Preface to my Printed Narrative, my Errors being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with theirs, were but as Motes to their Beams, which Motes I had ſo far pull'd out of my own Eyes, that I had made a general publick Acknowledgment of them in Print, and a particular Acknowledgment of as many of them, as came under my Obſervation, to divers particular Perſons <hi>viva voce. Thirdly,</hi> The particular occaſion given to me by my Adverſaries, did juſtly give me cauſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with detecting their Errors, for they did Excommunicate me (as they did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend) for breaking the Peace of the Church, which pretended Breach was my oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the vile Errors and Hereſies I had proved divers of the Preachers in <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvania</hi> guilty of. They who Excommunicated me here at <hi>London, viz.</hi> the Yearly Meeting, where <hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>W. Penn</hi> were the Ring-leaders, inſtead of blaming theſe Perſons in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> or cenſuring their vile Errors, did juſtifie theſe Men, and would take no notice of my effectual Proofs againſt them, but did moſt abominably cloak them, and gave out a Bull of Excommunication againſt me, (which together with my Anſwer to it I Printed ſoon after) as if I had been the only Offender, and I did quickly perceive, what the bottom was why they did ſo juſtifie theſe Men, and cloak their Errors, even becauſe they were guilty of the ſame Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors themſelves, and were the Nurſing-mothers, out of whoſe Breaſts theſe in <hi>Penſilvania</hi> had ſucked that poiſonous Milk; therefore it was neceſſary that they ſhould in the firſt place be diſcovered, to give warning to the many Thouſands that were ſo greatly deceived by them. I deſire the <hi>Friendly Reader</hi> to excuſe my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting in this ſhort Treatiſe, divers perverſions and miſrepreſentations of my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, caſt upon divers Paſſages in my Books, with my Anſwers unto them, the nature of the preſent Caſe ſo requiring it to be, without which my Explication of theſe things had not been ſo clear, nor my juſt Defence ſo intelligible.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I deſire them to take notice, As I have not here, or elſewhere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, nor renounced any one Aſſertion, contained in any of my former Books, that ever was Judged by me an Article of Faith, ſo they will not find (as I have not found) that my Adverſaries have proved any Contradiction in my latter Books, to any Article of Faith Aſſerted in my former Books.</p>

            <head>George Keith's Explications, AND Retractations: CONTAINING An Impartial Review of his former Printed books, relating chiefly to matters of Doctrine: Wherein are given divers Explanations, as alſo E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations and Corrections of divers Paſſages in his ſaid books, no wiſe derogating from, nor invalidat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the weight of his former Teſtimony, but greatly confirming it, with reſpect to the great <hi>Truths</hi> of the Chriſtian Faith and Doctrine.</head>
            <head>SECTION I. <hi>Containing divers Explanations and Emendations of Paſſages in my Book called,</hi> Immediate Revelation not ceaſed; <hi>Firſt Printed in the Year</hi> 1668. <hi>and Re-printed with an Appendix in the Year</hi> 1676.</head>
            <p n="1">I. AS Concerning the Term <hi>Immediate Revelation,</hi> in the Title Page of that Book, at which ſome are offended, and which ſome miſconſtrue to a wrong ſenſe, never intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by me, as if thereby I did ſignify ſuch a Revelation, as did give us the Doctrinal knowledge and Faith of Chriſtian Religion, and Principles thereof, without the Holy Scriptures, or other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means of Inſtruction; to obviate this offence and miſtake I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the Reader what I have ſaid, from <hi>pag.</hi> 38. to <hi>pag.</hi> 42. of that Book: Where I diſtinguiſh of <hi>means Intermitting</hi> and <hi>Tranſmitting,</hi> and ſhow that it is the <hi>Intermitting means</hi> that hinder the Revelation to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66443:4"/>
be Immediate, but not the <hi>Tranſmitting,</hi> and the ſame diſtinction I uſe in my Book, called, <hi>Divine Immediate Revelation,</hi> Printed in the Year 1684. But in other words, as <hi>diſcontinued</hi> and <hi>continued.</hi> Moreover, how far I did own the Holy Scriptures to be a neceſſary means, to give us the true Knowledge and Faith of Chriſtian Doctrines and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. I refer the Reader to my Book, <hi>Divine Immediate Revelation,</hi> p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Where I ſay, <q>And if we except theſe Doctrines and Heads of General Religion common to us, with the Gentiles, which are reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both to them and us, without Scripture, of all which notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scripture doth abundantly teſtify, all other Doctrines and Heads of the Chriſtian Religion, (which is a ſpecial Religion, more perfect and excellent than the General, and perfecting the ſaid Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Religion, in true Chriſtians) are made known to us, by the Scripture-means; the Holy Spirit inwardly inlightning and inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, that we may underſtand the Doctrines declared in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and may ſavingly apply them with true and ſincere Faith to the ſalvation of our Souls.</q> And here Note, that in the words above cited, I did diſtinguiſh twelve years ago betwixt <hi>Gentile</hi> Religion, and <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> tho ſome call this a New Doctrine in me ſo to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlinguiſh. And ſeeing the word Immediate Revelation is no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Term, (tho Revelation is) and that it is not well underſtood by many, I can freely conſent, that the word Immediate be not preſſed, or impoſed on any. But I do conſtantly aſſert, (as I have formerly aſſerted) that the inward ſenſible Communications and Enjoyments of God and Chriſt, that the Saints have frequent Experience of, are not only beyond all Demonſtration of words, but are oft received without all preſent uſe of words, in a deep inward ſilence of the Soul.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That I blame them who ſay, that the Scriptures are a filled up Canon, and the only Rule of Faith and Obedience in all things, and no more Scriptures (or Writings) to be given forth <note place="margin">Pref. Imm. Rev.</note> from the Spirit of the Lord. And <hi>pag.</hi> 4. That I ſaid, tho no <hi>NEW ESSENTIALS ARE</hi> to be added, yet a New and fuller and clearer Teſtimony may be added, concerning the ſame old eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials. Here Note, the words <hi>may be added,</hi> as importing the poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſuch a thing. But whether God ſhall be pleaſed to add to the Books of the Holy Scripture, other Books of the ſame Authority, in any time to come before the End of the World, I Judge it is not ſafe for me to determine, either in the Affirmative or Negative, but that it is poſſible he may do it, ought not to be queſtioned of. But that any Mens Writings (beſide that of the Prophets and Apoſtles,) are of equal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority with the Scriptures, ought not to be granted, and that all Doctrines of Men, however ſo much Illuminated, ought to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the Rule, teſt and touchſtone of the Holy Scripture, and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:66443:4"/>
by the ſame, I do aſſert, as formerly I have done, ſtill leaving Room to the Spirit, to give particular Guidance to the Souls of the Faithful, with reſpect to their inward State, and directing them, in Particular Caſes and Affairs, <hi>as to things</hi> in themſelves Lawful, and not forbidden, nor Commanded in General by any poſitive Precept; and that I ſaid no New Eſſentials are to be added, is ſufficient Proof, that I held the Scripture did contain all the Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Doctrines of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p n="3">III. As to my blaming them, who deny that there is <note place="margin">Preſ. Imm. Rev.</note> an infallible way, whereby to diſcern the true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Members of Chriſts Church from the falſe. To this I ſay, tho ſuch a diſcerning of Spirits was given at times to the Prophets and Apoſtles, and others extraordinarily endued, whereby to know Mens inward States, without regard had to their Fruits; yet the general way that Chriſt has given us, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to know Men, is by their Fruits, of words and works, whether Good or Evil. And whatever inward ſenſe, or diſcerning any may pretend to have of another Mans Spirit being bad, yet we find no warrant from Scripture to receive an Accuſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any, far leſs a poſitive Judgment, without plain evidence of matter of Fact againſt them, by credible Witneſſes, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 19. For if ſuch a thing be given way to, in any Society, that Men ſhall be Judged to be of a wrong Spirit, only by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended diſcerning of Spirits, that ſome may claim without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Proof or Evidence of words or works, that are really evil, the moſt innocent Men may happen to be Condemned, and the moſt guilty juſtified.

For when the <hi>Vital Union</hi> betwixt Soul and Body is broken, the <hi>Soul</hi> doth wholly ceaſe to act in that body while it is dead; But Chriſt ceaſeth not oft times to act in a dead ſoul, but doth oft act in it by ſharp Reproof and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction for its ſin, and alſo by new and freſh Viſitations of his Life and Love, in order to quicken and renew it again. Moreover, the Soul and Body of a Man are ſo united, that they make up one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but ſo are not Chriſt and the Soul united, as to be one Perſon: for that would make every Saint to be Chriſt, The Union betwixt the Soul and Body of a Man is a Perſonal Union, whereby every A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the body is chargable upon the Perſon, according to that true Maxim <hi>Actiones ſunt ſuppoſitorum;</hi> i. e.

But the Actions of Mens Souls, in whom Chriſt is, are not chargeable upon Chriſt, for as Chriſt is no wiſe chargeable with the leaſt Sin that the Soul Acteth, ſo when the Soul repenteth, and believeth, <hi>&amp;</hi> c.

But all this doth not prove, that I ever did hold, that the Light within is ſufficient to ſalvation without any thing elſe; for I did always believe, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is our intire and compleat Saviour, in both reſpects, <hi>viz.</hi> both as he came outwardly in the Fleſh, and died for our ſins, and became a Sacrifice of a ſweet ſavour unto God, to make a Reconciliation betwixt God and us, and alſo as he cometh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and is in us, as the Eternal <hi>Word;</hi> but I never held, that the Word alone was our entire and Compleat Saviour, without his tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true Nature of Man upon him.

I ſtill hold, and that in a figurative way of Synecdoche, it may be called <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or as the word <hi>Goſpel</hi> may be extended to a more general ſignification than is commonly uſed in Scripture, I will not deny; for taken at large, it may ſignifie any Intimation of God's Love, Goodneſs and Mercy to ſinful men; and in this ſenſe it may be ſaid, that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel hath been preached in every Creature, <hi>i. e.</hi> in every Man. And as the Divine Principle, Word and Light within preacheth in ſome ſort, the Love, Goodneſs and Mercy of God to ſinful men, in order to their ſalvation, ſo every creature without, or, ſo to ſpeak, the whole Creation, both without Man and in Man himſelf, doth preach it, as it is ſaid, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 19. 1. <hi>The Heavens declare the glory of God,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66443:13"/>
1 <hi>T.</hi> 3. 16. therefore I do freely retract and correct my undue <hi>application</hi> of theſe places of Scriptue to the inward Principle; as to what it did or doth diſcover and reveal univerſally in men, and particularly in ſuch of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to whom the Goſpel was not outwardly preached; for upon a more diligent ſearch into the holy Scripture, I find, that in all places in the New Teſtament, where the word <hi>Goſpel</hi> is uſed, it ſignifieth the Doctrine of ſalvation by the promiſed Meſſiah, that was outwardly to come, and did come in the true Nature of Man, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſpiritual bleſſings that men were to receive by him, of which the inward principle of God's Grace, Light and Spirit within, both in general to all, and in ſpecial to believers, in a more excellent degree and manner of Operation and Influence, is but a part. Yet I confine not the Goſpel, even in this ſenſe, to outward preaching, by the Miniſtry of Men or Books; for it was preached to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> after the Fall, by God himſelf, and ſo was it to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> and ſo it is probable it has been to divers, even to ſome <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſingular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly favoured without the Miniſtry of Men, though in God's ordinary way it is preached by the Miniſtry of Men, God himſelf by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and divine Influence inwardly accompanying the ſame, to work the true Faith of it in the Hearers. Therefore whatever Doctrine Men preach, or have at any time preached, the great Subject where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is not the promiſed Meſſiah, to wit, the Crucified Jeſus, as the main Foundation of all the Spiritual Bleſſings of Light, and Grace, and divine Influences of the Spirit within, it is not the Goſpel in the proper, full and adequate Senſe and Signification of it, as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture uſeth it. And as concerning that place in <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1. 23. and other ſuch places, as I have noted above, though the Greek Particle <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is oft properly Tranſlated <hi>in,</hi> yet not always, and there is no cauſe ſo to Tranſlate it here, but rather to, for the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in that place means the Doctrine of Salvation by Chriſt Crucified, and the Grace and gift of the Holy Spſrit given of God to Men through him, as it was preached by him, and the other Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, in that clear and bright Diſpenſation of it, that was then given. And though it was not at that time actually preached to all Men, nor to all Nations, yet becauſe it began then ſo to be preached, and was certainly to be preached to all Nations, and will be ſo preached be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end of the World, therefore after the Prophetical Phraſe of Scripture, That which was to be done, is ſaid to be done:</p>
            <p n="8">VIII.

            </p>
            <p>Here <hi>Note,</hi> That I did not place our Salvation wholly upon
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66443:14"/>
Chriſt's inward appearance, but upon God his ſending him, both in the outward and inward, to bruiſe the Serpents head. And that I did not underſtand, that the bringing Men ſimply to the inward Principle, ſo as only to believe in the Light, Word, or Spirit within, was the bringing them to the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Faith, but that it was a proper means by way of preparation and introduction, in order to the gathering of People into the true Faith of Chriſt, which is the whole aim and ſcope of my fifth Argument in that Book, from P. 88. to 94. where note theſe words, p. 92. <hi>And this will bring People naturally to own the Scriptures, and things therein declared, to own</hi> Moſes, <hi>and the Prophets, to own the Diſpenſation of God to the Jews in that day, and to own Chriſt in the Fleſh, his miraculous Birth, his Doctrine, Miracles, Sufferings, Death, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, and Aſcenſion, together with the wonderful end and deſign of God therein,</hi> &amp;c. And this Method I very well approve of ſtill; for as the knowledge of Chriſt, the Word Incarnate, or <hi>made Fleſh,</hi> preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth ſome knowledge of God, and of his Word, ſo to preach to People that are ignorant of God, and of his Divine Perfections, that there is a God, and what his Divine Perfections are, is very proper and neceſſary, that they may be brought into ſome true knowledge of him, which they cannot be brought into, without ſome Divine Illumination of the inward Principle, the Internal Word and Light. But all this is an introduction and preparation to diſpoſe the Souls and Hearts of Men to receive the Chriſtian Faith and Religion, and is not the Explicite Chriſtian Faith it ſelf (no more than the Porch that leads into the Houſe is the Houſe, though it may be ſaid to be a part of it,) as in the definition of a Man, that he is a living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Animal, is not his true definition, but the Genus of it, which is but a part at moſt; but when the difference is ſuperadded, that he is a Rational, or Intellectual Living Creature, that is his true definition. And ſo the true definition of a true Chriſtian, and ſincere Believer in Chriſt, is he who not only believes that there is a God, and that in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that the Word was made Fleſh, and that the Son of God by Eternal Generation became the Son of Man, by a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Generation in time, and ſo is both God and Man, and yet not two Sons of God, but one, not two Chriſts, but one. This is the true Chriſtian Explicite Faith: like a Tree ſpreading forth its boughs and branches (together with the other great Truths of the Chriſtian Doctrine, delivered in the Holy Scriptures) with rich and precious Fruit, to which the implicit Faith, in ſome Virtuous Gentiles, may be compared to that ſame Tree, when it was in the Seed, or but a little ſprung up into the Bud, or Blade, as Chriſt compared the Kingdom of God, to wit, the Evangelical Diſpenſation, <hi>Mark</hi> 4. 26, 27, 28, 29. Compare this with what is above quoted out of that Book p. 6. §. 3. of this Section, and with what is ſaid p. 61 of that Book.</p>

And in fine, although I firmly remain in my Faith and Perſuaſion, of the Truth, of that great Principle of the Univerſal Love and Grace of God, making Salvation poſſible to all Men, and that in order thereunto, Chriſt hath Inlightened every Man that cometh into the World; which univerſal Illumination, is an univerſal Benefit that all Men have by his dying for them, as is largely urged by me, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from p. 31, to 34. in that Book, and in divers other places; and that it was my principal Aim and Deſign in that Book to prove and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Truth of that Principle, which I am well ſatisfied, as to the main, I have truly done, by divers effectual and ſolid Arguments; and therefore I adhere to what I have delivered in that Book, as to the main, yet I freely acknowledge, that divers of the Arguments I have uſed to prove the Truth of that Principle, are not ſo proper and demonſtrative, nor are ſeveral places of Scripture, from which I argued, ſo duly apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that effect, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 7, 8, 9, 10. and the ſeveral Parables brought in Arg. 10. from p. 60. to 65. <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 11, 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 7. Therefore the undue Application of theſe places of Scripture, or any others that can be found in my Book to that effect, I freely Retract, which though they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily reſpect the inward Principle of God's Grace, Word, Spirit, Light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet theſe places are not to be underſtood only and alone of that, but reſpect that bright Goſpel Diſpenſation, that had then appeared in the World by the Apoſtles preaching, which was accompanied with new ſuperadded Illuminations, in the Souls and Hearts of Believers (tho' all coming from one Fountain, one God, one Chriſt, and one Spirit,) as much differing from, and as much excelling and ſurmounting any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Illumination given to all that part of Mankind, where the Apoſtles Doctrine concerning Chriſt Crucified and Raiſed again did not come, as the Light of the Sun after he is riſen, excells that which ſhineth in the Night time, which is a Scripture Compariſon, that compareth the ſtate that the Gentiles generally were in, before God viſited them, by the Preaching of the Goſpel in the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles, and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, to the Night, but the State of the Believing Gentiles, who had received the Holy Ghoſt by their Miniſtry to the Day; which very Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction I had noticed in the ſtating of the Queſtion, p. 8. of that Book. And that bright Diſpenſation of the Goſpel, that did viſit the World, by means of the Apoſtles Miniſtry, and their true Succeſſors, was like the riſing of the Sun, that may be ſaid to be truly Univerſal, and the Grace of God, that bringing Salvation did appear unto all, as the Sun is truly ſaid to riſe unto all, and to bring day unto all, tho not at one and the ſame time, and Chriſts Prophecy, which then began to be fulfilled, and was in great part fulfilled, in the very time of the Apoſtles, muſt be fully and compleatly fulfilled, that the Goſpel of the Kingdom ſhall be Preached in all the VVorld, which is to ſay, not the Inward Principle only and alone, but the Doctrine of Chriſts Birth, Death, Burial, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As is plain from his own words, wherever this Goſpel

But what my reaſon cannot comprehend my Faith teacheth me to believe, and ſo I believe that their is a Principle, Seed, or Leaven of Sinful Defilement, conveyed generally through all <hi>Adams</hi> Poſterity in the Natural Birth, becauſe I find many places of Scripture that ſufficiently prove it, by means whereof Infants on the Breaſts and in the VVomb, are not clean, but defiled, and therefore need the New Birth and waſhing of Regeneration, as really as adult per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.

And <hi>pag.</hi> 26. Although the Saints do not eat the viſible Fleſh of Chriſt [to wit, by the Bodily Mouth] and drink his viſible Blood, yet they partake of the benefit and virtue of both his Fleſh and his Blood, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of both doth remain, which is his glorified Body in Heaven, and the virtue of which doth really extend unto the Saints both in Heaven, and on Earth, by which they are ſpiritually refreſhed and nouriſhed, as with Meat and Drink; and thus we do not divide Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

And whereas, <hi>pag.</hi> 25. it is ſaid, and indeed it is very plain by the words of Chriſt, that by his Fleſh and Blood, <hi>John</hi> 6. 50, 51. he meaneth <hi>Only</hi> Spirit and Life; <hi>The word</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that I ſpeak unto you, are Spirit and Life; it is the Spirit that quickneth, the Fleſh profiteth nothing:</hi> Whether the Word <hi>only</hi> being there is a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pographical Error, or was an overſight in me, for want of due conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, I hold it needful to retract and correct it, and accordingly I ſo do: and that it was at moſt an overſight in me, for want of due con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, and that by it, I did not intend that the Faithful did not partake of the unſpeakable benefit of the Fleſh of Chriſt, that was out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly Crucified, and of his Blood that was outwardly ſhed, and that the virtue of it did not extend unto them, for that is above plainly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, but my ſenſe was, they were not to eat it with the bodily Mouth, but by Faith, ſo as to have the virtue of it conveyed unto them, by a living Faith in him, which virtue may be ſaid to be Spirit and Life, and the Words that he ſpake, had a ſpiritual ſenſe and ſignification, and not ſuch as the carnal <hi>Capernaumites</hi> did conceive.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Here Note, That my bringing the words of <hi>Hilarius</hi> to excuſe <hi>G. F.</hi> was not that I did not believe that Chriſt had the true nature of Man, conſiſting of a true reaſonable created Soul, and a true Body; for that I did always believe, and that he did partake of <hi>Mary</hi>'s Subſtance, for ſo did alſo <hi>Hilarius</hi> believe. But ſeeing Chriſt had a miraculous Conception, and Birth, above all other Men; therefore I did judge that <hi>G. F.</hi> and ſome others with him, meant only by blaming the word <hi>humane,</hi> and <hi>humanity, humane Nature,</hi> as applicable to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that his Manhood Nature was more excellent, than that of other men: But I never thought, that any of them denyed him, as Man to be a Creature, or to have been produc'd by Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of and from the Properties of Man in <hi>Mary,</hi> as ſome of them have. But of late divers of the chief Teachers among the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> have uſed the terms <hi>Humanity,</hi> and <hi>Humane,</hi> with reference to <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But what they underſtand by it, is not eaſie to determine; for if <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Humanity be not a Creature, or created, what is it? ſeeing it cannot be the Godhead: and <hi>T. Ellwood</hi> hath argued in his late Book, <hi>That if Christ be a Creature, he is not God.</hi> But all who have the ſound Faith, believe that Chriſt, as a Man, is a Creature, or created Being; but as he is the Eternal Word, he is God, and not a Creature. But this they think a contradiction, not owning that Chriſt hath a twofold Nature eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to him, the one uncreated, as God, the other created as Man, and yet but one Chriſt, therefore they have ſaid, <hi>That Man or outward Perſon that ſuffered [at</hi> Jeruſalem,] <hi>is not properly the Son of God:</hi> So <hi>W.

Whitehead</hi> had put that ſenſe on that place, in prejudice to Chriſt's coming without us, to judge the World in his glorified Body, and Perſon, as ſince I have found, for not only did he deny this place to be meant of his Coming without us, to Judgment, but any other places that his Opponents brought to prove his outward coming to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he turned them all to his inward coming, as that in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 15. and that in <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 27. and brought that in <hi>John</hi> 14. to prove that Chriſt was not to come in Perſon, or in a Perſonal Exiſtence to judge the World, <hi>Yet a little while, and the World ſhall ſee me no more.</hi> This poſitive unbelief of theirs, which I had but of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:66443:16"/>
late diſcovered by a more narrow ſearch into their Books, hath awakened me, I confeſs better, to conſider things, that both I and they had formerly written; and upon better conſideration, I declare I am convinced, that the true ſenſe of theſe words above-mentioned, is of his outward coming the ſecond time, in his glorified Body to judge the World: and it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Second Coming, as denoting his former coming, which was in his ſtate of Humilation; but his Second Coming ſhall be in a ſtate of Glorification. I ſhall not enlarge to give my Reaſons at preſent, why I ſo underſtand that place of his coming without us, nor to anſwer largely the Reaſons I gave in that Book, that it was to be underſtood of his inward coming, for that would take up too much time, and be improper in this place, it ſufficeth at preſent, that I retract that ſenſe formerly given, and that I declare my ſenſe of that place of Scripture to be, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerning his coming without us to Judgment, which is, I think, the more general ſenſe of Chriſtian Expoſitors. But let none from hence infer, that I deny the <hi>inward coming</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in mens hearts, to deſtroy Sin, for that I own; but I ſay, it is not the true ſenſe of that place of Scripture; and whereas it is ſaid in that place, <hi>He will appear the Second time without Sin unto Salvation,</hi> doth not infer, (being underſtood of his coming without us to Judgment) that Sin remains in the deceaſed Saints, until his coming: But that at his coming, he will not charge Sin upon them, but will ſolemnly acquit and diſcharge them, of all their Sins, however great they have been, who have ſincerely repented of them, and believed in him: whereas upon all others, he will charge their Sins upon them, as is clear from <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. And though the deceaſed Saints need no Salvation from Sin, yet from ſome of the effects and conſequences of it they do, until the Reſurrection, with reſpect to which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>We are ſaved by Hope, and Hope that is ſeen, is not Hope,</hi> &amp;c. For ſeeing Death is the laſt enemy that is to be deſtroyed, which is not deſtroyed but by the Reſurrection from the Dead; therefore the Reſurrection from the Dead is that Salvation, which all the Saints both living and deceaſed wait for, which will be at Chriſt's coming without us. And that this was my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, when I did write that Book, as well as formerly, I ſhall for proof recite two plain paſſages out of that Book, the firſt is, pag. 42. where I ſay, <hi>We believe with all our Hearts, and in believing the ſame, we rejoice with Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory, in all our Sufferings, Tryals and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, even that He whom we look for, will come again at the Laſt Day, and raiſe us up to live with him for ever, in an immortal and incorruptible Body: and then ſhall we be ſaved, as well from all the conſequences of Sin of all kinds, as now from Sin it ſelf, in the being and nature of it. For then, and not till then, fully and in all reſpects, ſhall Death be ſwallowed up in Victory, and that full Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and enjoyment be attained, which all true Chriſtians do yet wait for.</hi> The ſecond paſſage is, pag. 45. <hi>And I hope it will ſatisfie any ſober Reader that we</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:66443:17"/>
               <hi>acknowledge the Coming of Chriſt in the Clouds, or in the Air in a Literal Senſe.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 65. That Chriſt will come in the End of the World, we do faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully believe, according to that 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. and other Scriptures. But that his coming, mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. is that laſt coming of his, is not yet proved, but is a meer begging of the Queſtion.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Note,</hi> That this paſſage contains another plain proof, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that <hi>Christ</hi> would come in the End of the World in his Glorified Perſon, without us, to judge the World; and I judged that the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> generally ſo believed, until my late experience hath given me ſufficient ground to think otherwiſe, and that from the Words of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers among them, plainly denying, and ridiculing any ſuch thing, telling me, the End of the World is already come, and there is no other coming of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be expected, but his inward coming in the Hearts of People, and into this foul Error the Printed Books of <hi>G. W.</hi> and other Leading Men among their Teachers had led them; although now, he and ſome others ſeem to own it, that <hi>Christ</hi> will outwardly come again. But if a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny were made among them one by one, few among them in compariſon, would be found to own it, in reſpect of many that would deny it. But whereas in that paſſage above-quoted, I had affirmed, <hi>That our Lord's coming, mentioned,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 26. <hi>is that laſt coming of his, is not yet proved, but is a meer begging of the Queſtion:</hi> This whole Paſſage, I fully and freely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, with all the other paſſages, either in this Book, or in my Book called <hi>Truth Defended,</hi> where I have denyed his <hi>coming,</hi> mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. to be his <hi>outward coming,</hi> or in any other of my Books, where any ſuch like paſſage is to be found, I fully and freely Retract them all: And on the Contrary, I do freely, and with great Satisfaction, declare, That I am ſufficiently convinced and perſwaded in my Conſcience, that the <hi>Coming</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> mentioned 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11: is His <hi>Laſt Coming,</hi> which is to be <hi>without us,</hi> which will be accompanyed with his more abundant <hi>inward coming</hi> and <hi>Revelation</hi> in us. As alſo, whatever is ſaid in this Book, called the <hi>Rector Corrected,</hi> concerning the Command that our Lord gave to his Apoſtles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. That it was not <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, I fully and freely Retract that alſo; and all the like paſſages, either in <hi>Truth Defended,</hi> or in any of my other Books whatſoever, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerning the ſenſe of that place of Scripture, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. And on the contrary, I do declare that I am fully and clearly perſwaded in my Conſcience, that <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> was there commanded by Chriſt. And here I think fit to Tranſcribe what I have already ſaid in my late Book, called <hi>The Antichriſts and Sadduces detected,</hi> &amp;c. to this effect, pag. 34, 35. <q>
                  <hi>I am not aſhamed to own my general Miſtakes I have been under, concerning divers places of Scripture, particularly relative to</hi> Water-Baptiſm <hi>and the</hi> Supper, <hi>as</hi> Matth. 28. 19. <hi>and</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 26.<hi>—And I am ſo far from being aſhamed to publiſh this Confeſſion, that I have great Peace and Joy in it.</hi>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:66443:17"/>
                  <hi>Amd I alſo declare, that I am juſtly aſhamed that I have been ſo long deceived and byaſſed with ſuch weak Arguments, as both they called</hi> Friends <hi>and I have uſed (being too much influenced and byaſſed by their pretended Authority) to perſwade and draw away the Minds of People from the true ſenſe of theſe places of Scripture, and the Arguments that we have uſed againſt theſe two things, are ſo weak, that they have the ſome force againſt the Bible it ſelf, and all Books and outward Teſtimonies, and outward Acts of Worſhip, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are void in themſelves; for ſeeing they have no force againſt the latter, they have as little againſt the former. However, I continue in my faithful Teſtimony againſt the abuſe of theſe things, and the dead, empty and formal may that too many practiſe them; and except the Lord be found to bleſs and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them, who uſe them with his Power and Spirit, they are but as empty Shadows and Shells; but who find the Lord to bleſs them with his Preſence, I judge them not.</hi>
               </q> It is not proper for me in this place, to give any large account of the Reaſons, why I am otherwiſe minded, as to the Senſe of thoſe two places of Scripture, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. than I was ſometime formerly, only I think fit to give one Reaſon at preſent in particular as to each, and another in general as to both. My reaſon why <hi>Water-Baptiſm</hi> is to be underſtood, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. as a thing commanded of the Lord to be done by the Apoſtles, and not the Baptiſm with the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe we no where find in all the Scripture ſuch a phraſe or manner of Speech that ever any Man (but Chriſt alone who is both God and Man) did Baptize with the Holy Ghoſt, or had power ſo to do, it is peculiarly attributed to <hi>Christ,</hi> (whoſe Work it was) and ſtill is, and to no other Man, or Men, as <hi>John</hi> declared, <hi>He that cometh after me, ſhall Baptize you</hi> (he did not ſay, They that come after me, but he) <hi>with Fire and with the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And as to that diſtinction formerly given by me, and others, that though the Apoſtles neither could nor did baptize with the Holy Ghoſt principally, yet inſtrumentally or miniſterially, they might and did. But in anſwer to this, I ſay, where the Scripture doth not diſtinguiſh, nor give any ground of ſuch a diſtinction, we ought not to give it: But the Scripture giveth no ſuch ground; and the Scripture phraſe and manner of Speech is ſtrictly to be obſerved in all ſuch caſes, ſo that we ought not to put our private gloſſes on <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: as it were a moſt abſurd Diſtinction to ſay, though God created the World principally, yet Angels did create it inſtrumentally; or to ſay, Chriſt redeemed the World principally by his Death and Sufferings, but the Martyrs redeemed the World, by their Deaths, inſtrumentally; ſurely as theſe Diſtinctions are falſe and unwarrantable, ſo is that other about Baptizing with the Spirit inſtrumentally and miniſterially. My reaſon why the comeing of the Lord mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. is his outward Comeing; becauſe the outward practiſe of Breaking Bread, in the Supper, was appointed as a commemoration (in a ſolemn way) of his Body that was broken for us on the Croſs, and of his Bodily Sufferings and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66443:18"/>
Humiliation? for he did not ſay, Take, eat this is my Spirit; but <hi>This is my Body,</hi> and it was the Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> that ſaid this; therefore, as the practiſe of Breaking the Bread, with Prayer and Thankſgiving, and Eating it, and Pouring out Wine into the Cup, and Drinking it, was a ſolemn Commemoration of his Body that was broken for us, and his Blood that was ſhed for us; ſo the believers being enjoyned to do it, untill his comeing again; that <hi>Comeing again</hi> muſt needs ſignifie his Bodily Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (for he was Spiritually come both then and in all Ages to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) that the living and faithful Remembrance of his laſt coming might be preſerved by that ſolemn Practiſe, and alſo the unſpeakable benefit that the Faithful haveby his Sufferings; for as Preaching by Words doth hold forth <hi>Chriſt</hi> Crucified by audible Signs to the Ears of the Faithful; ſo do theſe outward things duly practiſed by viſible and otherwiſe ſenſible Signs hold him forth to their Eyes, Smelling, Taſt, and Feeling, that ſo the Remembrance of him by theſe ſo many doors, as it were may the more effectually enter into their Hearts, and make the deeper Impreſſion upon them; and it ſtands well with good reaſon that, what is repreſented to Mens Hearts of our Lord's Sufferings, by their Hearing, Sight, Smell, Taſting, and Feeling in the uſe of theſe ſigns inſtituted by himſelf, will more effectually affect their Hearts and Souls than what is done alone by the Hearing or Reading; as in other caſes, for Men to ſee a Tragedy of the real Sufferings of ſome noble Perſon acted before their Sight, is more than to read it, or hear a Report of it, and on this account it was that ſome ancient Writers called theſe outward Inſtitutions <hi>verbum viſibile,</hi> i. e the viſible Word. My reaſon in general for both is, that it hath pleaſed. God of late (ſince I have found the great oppoſition to this great funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Truth of the Goſpel, that many among the People called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> have made, <hi>viz.</hi> the Faith in Chriſt crucified, and raiſed again <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as a neceſſary thing to our <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> and Salvation, let them pretend and profeſs what they will to the contrary) to give me a further and clearer ſight, and a more deep inward ſenſe and conſideration of the great benefit and advantage, the practiſe of theſe outward things (when duly practiſed) is to the preſerving the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Doctrine and Faith in the World, as well as to divers other great uſes and ends, they being as proper and effectual means in their kind and manner in conjunction with Preaching, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Doctrine and Faith of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the World as Preaching it ſelf; and where theſe outward things are practiſed, the true Doctrine of them ought to be Preached; but the Doctrine of them is like to be laid aſide, when the Practiſe of them is not only diſcontinued, but oppoſed, and reviled, under the Names of <hi>beggarly Elements, worldly Rudiments,</hi> and <hi>carnal Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</hi> And I do boldly and freely, in the ſincerity of my Heart, further declare, that it hath pleaſed God to give me to ſee, that the ſpring and riſe of thatgreat Oppoſition that hath been, and is in many againſt theſe outward Practices, has been and is a ſecret Prejudice againſt the Doctrine
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:66443:18"/>
of <hi>Chriſt</hi> crucified, and the myſterious working of an Antichriſtian and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolical ſpirit, deſigning to draw men from Name and Thing of <hi>Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> to Paganiſm and Deiſm, and at the next ſtep to Idolatry, and Atheiſm. Howbeit, in many there is not this knowledge and ſight of this Myſtery of Iniquity. But many ſimple-hearted, and truly pious, and well-meaning Souls, have been led aſide, to diſown, and ſpeak againſt the uſe of theſe outward Practices, being ſtumbled and greatly offended with the beholding the great abuſe of them, and the undue and irregular way and manner of many their practiſing them, as it was ſaid, that the Sons of <hi>Ely</hi> cauſed the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Lord to be abhorred. But as the abuſe of things, ought not to take away the due uſe of them, ſo where they are not duly practiſed, the ſimple want of them, (as neither the ſimple want of preaching, where the Goſpel is not outwardly preached) I judge will not be imputed to them to be their Sin, it being generally acknowledged among ſober judicious <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that it's not the want of them, but the wilful neglect of them, where they can be duly had, that is a man's Sin, and hindrance to his Salvation. I adhere to the general rule of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Communion in this caſe, generally received and owned by all true <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that we ought to join in all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal acts of <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion and Worſhip, with all profeſſed <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> holding the Fundamentals of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> and maintaining no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing contrary thereunto, againſt whoſe ſincerity we have nothing juſtly to object. If ſo in our joyning with them, in theſe external acts of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, nothing be required of us to be done, that is ſin in the ſight of God, to wit, that is any breach of any poſitive expreſs command of God.</p>

And it is the ſincere Confeſſion from the Heart to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as he outwardly came in the Fleſh, and to all the ſpiritual Bleſſings that men receive by him, as
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:66443:19"/>
of his Light, Spirit and Grace in them, that is the Confeſſion there meant; for every one that truly, <hi>viz.</hi> with ſincerity of heart ſo confeſſeth him, come in the Fleſh (whoſe Confeſſion floweth from a Living Faith in him) is of God, and whoſoever doth not ſo confeſs him, but deny him ſo come, is of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt; and this denyal of Chriſt come in the Fleſh, may be ſeveral ways, as <hi>1ſt.</hi> to deny that he who did ſo come, is the <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and thus the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing <hi>Jews</hi> did, and do deny him. <hi>2dly,</hi> To deny that he who did ſo come, was, and is, both God and Man, and that as ſuch he is the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, in whom they are to believe, and whom they are to call upon, and worſhip with divine adoration; and thus the <hi>Mahumetans</hi> do deny him, and many who go under the Name of <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> who deny that the man <hi>Chriſt</hi> is their Salvation, and the Object of Faith and adoration. <hi>3dly.</hi> To deny the virtue and efficacy of his being a Sacrifice, by his Death, for the Remiſſion of the ſins of all Men, who ever ſhall be ſaved from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the World, to the end of it. <hi>4thly.</hi> To deny that all the Light, and Grace, and divine Influence of the Spirit, that any Man have, or ever had, is by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who hath purchaſed and procured it unto them, by his moſt holy and perfect Obedience unto Death; and in theſe three reſpects my late Oppoſers among the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> are guilty of denying <hi>Chriſt</hi> come in the Fleſh, as I have ſufficiently proved againſt them in divers printed Books, particularly in my <hi>Narrative</hi> of the Proceedings at <hi>Turners-Hall,</hi> the 11th. of the 4th.

by this it doth appear, that it is no new Doctrine in me ſo to affirm, this Book of mine, having been in Print for ſixteen Years paſt, and which was approved by the Second Days Meeting, though in contradiction, to what they then approved, they have of late greatly blamed me, as guilty of broaching a new Doctrine, among the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> for my ſaying, It is a neceſſary Duty, that every one among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſhould give a Confeſſion of their Faith, to Chriſt and his doctrine in the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and eſſential parts thereof, before they can be owned to be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a Chriſtian communion: This they extreamly cry out againſt, knowing that ſuch a thing would diſcover the vile Errors, that are lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged among them.

And I ſtill adhere to my former Advice, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be required by one ſort from an other, as an Article of Faith or Doctrine, in common to be believed, but what is expreſly delivered in the Scriptures, in plain expreſs Scripture terms, yet not ſo as every Word muſt be expreſt, in ſo many Letters and Syllables, when there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary occaſion for it, for it may ſuffice, if a truth be expreſt in ſuch plain and eaſie terms, as are equivalent to Scripture terms, as when we ſay, <hi>Chriſt</hi> was born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> we mean that <hi>Bethlehem</hi> was a place without us; and alſo that <hi>Chriſt</hi> was born without us; and I confeſs, it had been as little needful to have mentioned Chriſt without us, or Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven without us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Judea</hi> without us, or any other place, had not that wild Notion of many, who own no <hi>Chriſt without,</hi> nor Heaven, nor Reſurrection, nor Day of Judgment <hi>without,</hi> but <hi>only within,</hi> occaſion'd it.</p>

               <hi>Pag.</hi> 191. <q>The ſacrifice of <hi>Chriſt's</hi> Death did truly extend for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins paſt, from the beginning of the World, Hence <hi>ALL THE BELIEVERS</hi> that lived under the Law, and Prophets, and <hi>BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORE THE LAW,</hi> were ſaved by <hi>FAITH IN CHRIST,</hi> and had their Sins pardoned, not by the Offering of the Blood of Bulls and Rams, but by the Blood of Chriſt, who was to dye for them, and in whom they believed, and dyed in Faith, as is clear out of many places of Scripture, and eſpecially the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> and by virtue of Chriſt's Death and Offering once for all Men, all <hi>have had,</hi> or <hi>have,</hi> or <hi>ſhall</hi> have, a Day of Viſitation, and offer of Grace through Chriſt, even theſe who lived before Chriſt came in the Fleſh, in that prepared Body, as well as others; and therefore all who finally periſh, and are loſt in whatever Age or Time of the World they lived, they muſt be accountable to Chriſt, who is judge both of quick and dead, and Lord of both, and they ſhall be puniſhed with Fire of Hell, for neglecting and deſpiſing the Salvation offered by him. And although this is a great Myſtery, and hard to be uttered, how this Goſpel Invitation, and Viſitation cometh unto all, and how all ſhall be accountable unto the Man Chriſt Jeſus, on the ſcore or account of his dying for them, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 42. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 31. Yet ſeeing the Scripture is ſo plain and clear for it, it is better to believe it, than curiouſly to diſpute, how or after what manner it comes ſo to be.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here <hi>Note,</hi> 1. Theſe foregoing Words, publiſhed by me in Print ſixteen
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:66443:20"/>
years ago, prove that I did not place our whole Salvation upon an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Principle, excluding the Man Chriſt Jeſus, from being jointly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with his Light, Grace and Spirit in men, as many called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> now do. 2. That I then held, that all who were ſaved in any Age of the World, were ſaved by Faith in Chriſt, as well before he came in the Fleſh, as ſince; and that by Faith in Chriſt, I meant the Man <hi>Chriſt,</hi> [who is both God and Man] who in the fulneſs of time, came in the Fleſh, and ſhed his Blood for the Remiſſion of their ſins, is obvious to any intelligent Reader; therefore my late Adverſaries among a ſort of <hi>Quakers,</hi> are moſt injurious to me, and falſe Accuſers of me, who call this a new Doctrine of mine, to affirm that all who ever were ſaved, or ſhall be ſaved with Eternal Salvation, were ſaved by Faith in the Man <hi>Chriſt,</hi> [either expreſs or implicit] even him that was in the Fulneſs of Time crucified for them. And it is but a trifling and nonſenſical Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection in them, to argue againſt it, that they could not believe in Chriſt crucified, before he was crucified; for it was one and the ſame Chriſt, that was to be crucified, and who was crucified in the fulneſs of time, the ſame yeſterday, to day, and forever, who is the Lamb ſlain from the Foundation of the World, and a Prieſt forever, and who therefore by virtue of the Sacrifice of himſelf, that was to be ſlain in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of time, made Peace betwixt Believers and God, as well before he came and ſuffered for the Sins of men as ſince, and on whoſe Account they had Remiſſion of Sin, and the Holy Ghoſt to ſanctifie them, and none had the Holy Ghoſt by union and indwelling, but ſuch as had ſome degree of Faith in Chriſt, either expreſs or implicit, as not only this Book called <hi>Truth Defended,</hi> but all my Books that treat on that ſubject plainly ſhew; and particulary my Book called, <hi>The Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian and Independent viſible Churches;</hi> all which I refer to the Reader's ſerious conſideration: And though my late Adverſaries among the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> find great fault, with divers paſſages in the Book laſt mentioned, eſpecially for aſſerting the neceſſity of <hi>Faith</hi> in <hi>Chriſt</hi> crucified univerſally either <hi>expreſs</hi> or <hi>implicit,</hi> for Eternal Salvation, yet that Book before it was printed in <hi>America,</hi> had the approbation of them called Friends in the Miniſtry in <hi>Penſilvania,</hi> and was ſo well approved by the <hi>Quakers</hi> here at <hi>London,</hi> that ſome cauſed it to be Reprinted, and it was publickly ſold in a <hi>Quakers</hi> Shop in <hi>George-Yard</hi> in <hi>Lumbard-ſtreet;</hi> nor did I ever hear any exceptions againſt it, from any of them in <hi>England,</hi> until our late differences betwixt them and me began: And whereas I had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, none but ſuch who have Faith in <hi>Christ</hi> crucified, or who was to be crucified, had the Holy Ghoſt by union. To this ſome of my late Adverſaries have objected a Quotation, I made in ſome of my former Books out of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Plotimus,</hi> who did mention <hi>union with God, and a certain divine contact;</hi> but it doth not appear, that theſe <hi>Gentiles</hi> had Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as above expreſt. To this I Anſwer, That <hi>Plato</hi> who lived ſome hundred of years before <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Incarnation, had no Faith in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:66443:21"/>
               <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo much as implicit, is more than they can prove; for there are divers ſayings in his Books that make it probable he had. There is leſs ground to think that <hi>Plotimus,</hi> who lived Two Hundred Years and more after CHRIST, and was contemporary with <hi>Origen,</hi> had Faith in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſeeing he writ againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> therefore what things he ſaid of <hi>Union with God,</hi> and the <hi>divine contact,</hi> and other high Expreſſions of the like nature might poſſibly be, not ſo much from his own experience, as from his Maſter <hi>Plato</hi>'s Writings, or allow he might have had ſome true experience of a divine contact and union, in ſome tranſient way, like a glance or flaſh of Lightning; yet this proves not that he, or any others, who never had any degree of Faith in <hi>Chriſt</hi> cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, [or that was to be crucified] had that <hi>permanent and laſting Union</hi> with the holy ſpirit that the Saints and Believers recorded in the holy Scriptures had, [which <hi>permanent</hi> and <hi>laſting Union,</hi> through the in ward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence and indwelling of the lively Spirit in the Faithful, is that which moſt properly deſerveth the name of Union with God] for it is moſt evident from the holy Scriptures, that none but Believers in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> even the Man <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> have the holy Spirit by union, and inhabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for which ſee and well conſider the following places, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 2. 14. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>John</hi> 7. 39. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 43, 44. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. And it is great Ignorance in my late Oppoſers, not to underſtand, how though the ſpirit of God, who is holy, may and doth work and operate, in the Hearts of Gentiles and Unbelievers, yet he hath no inward reſidence, or abiding union in them, or communion with them, but ſuch only who hath Faith in <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another trifling Objection they have made, that becauſe I have ſaid, <hi>That all who had not the expreſs knowledge of Chriſt before death, who are ſaved, had it either at Death, or after Death.</hi> From this they infer, I hold a ſort of Purgatory, or tranſmigration. But behold theſe mens ignorance, doth it imply any Purgatory or Tranſmigration, to ſay, all that go to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Heaven after Death, muſt have an expreſs knowledge of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Heaven, for ſo I expreſſed my ſence in my Book, called <hi>The pretended Antidote,</hi> &amp;c. pag. 115, 116. Can it be ſuppoſed, that any Souls now in Heaven, can be without all expreſs knowledge of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> can they be with him, and yet not know him? Hath not the leaſt Saint in Heaven, more clear knowledge of Chriſt, than any living on Earth? Suppoſe the Souls of <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Socrates</hi> be in Heaven (as far be it from me to judge the contrary) are they ſtill without all expreſs knowledge of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But if indeed they think there be no man <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Heaven, having any Bodily Exiſtence, as ſome of my Oppoſers have affirmed, its no wonder they think that the Saints in Heaven have no knowledge of him.</p>

            <p>Here <hi>Note,</hi> All theſe paſſages, ſo far as I did underſtand them, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the People called <hi>Quakers,</hi> as a viſible Body of People, together with the generality of their Miniſtry, and general way of Worſhip, and Diſcipline, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I retract, and revoke, as being too large and ample a commendation of them, generally conſidered, and all other paſſages of the like nature, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the generality of that People and their Miniſtry, that may be found either in this Book, or any other of my Books whatſoever: and I freely and willingly acknowledge my weakneſs, and ſhort-fightedneſs, in having ſo high and great an eſteem of them generally conſidered. My zeal and fervour,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:66443:22"/>
I freely conſeſs did carry me too far, even beyond the due Bounds, not only in the eſtimation I had of that People in general, but alſo in the Judgment and Thoughts I had of my own Attainments, though I dare not diſown it but I do to God's praiſe, declare it, that I had great inward experience of the Lord's love and goodneſs at that time when I wrote that Book, which was a time of great Suffering unto me, being ſtraitly confined in Priſon, where I met with divers Hardſhips and Severities from Men, all which the Lord turned to my ſpiritual Advantage, and the ſpiritual Comforts and Refreſhments where withal the Lord was pleaſed to viſit my Soul, were exceeding precious unto me, as they are at this day, feeling at this preſent time, theſe of the ſame kind and nature by the good Spirit of the Lord, continued and renewed unto me, notwithſtanding of the unjuſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable Judgment of my late Adverſaries againſt me, as if I were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a dry Tree, yet my Soul is alive to praiſe God, who hath preſerved me to this inſtant, in the midſt of many great and deep Exerciſes and Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, both inward and outward, one of the greateſt of which hath been, and is, the envy and rage of ſuch who have riſen up in great enmity againſt me, for my telling them the Truth, and my faithful oppoſing the Errors and Evils that I have found among them; and my truſt and Faith is in God through <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> that he will preſerve me to the end, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint and fruſtrate all their Falſe Prophecies, bitter Curſes, and lying Divinations they have poured out againſt me, and continue to utter both in print, and private Letters they ſend to me, for which I deſire and pray ſincerely unto God, that he may give them Repentance and Forgiveneſs. And being ſenſible, and truly convinced, that I had too far exceeded in the thoughts of my ſpiritual Attainments, not only then, but ſince; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whatever paſſages are to be found either in this firſt Book, or any other of my later Books, that are juſty offenſive, on the account of my going beyond the due Bounds of my real growth and ſpiritual and inward ſtate in the Truth, or of thinking of my inward Attainments and Calls, Services, Labours and Teſtimonies, beyond what I ought to have thought, or wherein either in this, or any other of my Books, I have ſeemed to my ſelf, or profeſſed to others, to have been acted by a purely divine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe and motion to ſpeak and write, I do freely and moſt willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and revoke it, ſo far as any thing of the leaſt mixture of miſtake or untruth is to be found therein; as I confeſs I have found ſome mixture in this Book, and in other my Books.</p>
            <p>And as in other things, I acknowledge my Miſtakes, as to the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> in general, ſo in this, that was the general miſtake among us, that their chief Leaders led us generally into, that the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> was the Church come out of the Wilderneſs. But for divers Years paſt, I have ſeen my Miſtakes as to this, and the great Defects, Diſorders, Confuſions, and Imperfections I have found among them, and eſpecially the ignorance, and great want of dne Qualifications in the generality of their Miniſtry, have given juſt ground to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:66443:22"/>
judge far otherwiſe concerning them. But yet I do affirm, that I have found divers that go under that Name, that have to my underſtanding and apprehenſion, made a good progreſs in ſpiritual Experiences, and other ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Attainments of Knowledge and Virtue. And I do ſtill continue in my real perſwaſion, and belief, that there was a good Work of God upon the Hearts of many of that People, and his mighty Power did ſtir and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in them, as I hope it doth in ſome continue to do unto this day. But greatly has the Power of Darkneſs and Error prevailed with many, eſpecially their Leaders in great part to miſlead them, and Preſumption and Pride, earthly Luſts, and uncharitableneſs, in ſo highly condemning others, are Sins that did and do greatly prevail among them, and hath brought a great Cloud of Darkneſs over many of them, which I pray God to remove, and cauſe his bleſſed Light to ſhine forth more among them, and all others, and that he would be pleaſed to knit and unite the Hearts of all that ſincerely love the Lord, to love one another, and make them of one Heart and Soul, that they may worſhip the Lord together in Spirit and in Truth; that as the Lord is one, all his People may be one, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not otherwiſe be effected, but by the more powerful Coming and Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> into their Hearts and inward parts, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them for his laſt coming in Glory, without them, to receive them to his Heavenly Kingdom: Even ſo, come <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> come quickly; <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding of the particular paſſages in that Book, which I have retracted, I adhere to my Teſtimony I have given in the ſame, as in all my other Books, as to Matter and Subſtance, of many weighty things there deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and the good Advice I gave to my Country-men in that Book, I wiſh heartily they would duly regard.</p>
            <p>Pag. 63. <q>And this Prophet <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is nigh unto us, yea, more nigh than all the Men or Books upon the face of the Earth.</q> And a little after. <q>And the Bride rejoyceth greatly, becauſe of the Voice of the Bridegroom himſelf: And now we need not-ſay, who will go down into the Grave, and bring up <hi>Chriſt</hi> to us; or who will aſcend to Heaven, to bring him down to us; or who will go over the Seas, and bring us tydings of him from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when he ſuffered in the Fleſh, him (whoſe Name is the Word of God) we of a truth witneſs near us, even in our Hearts, ſo that we need not either aſcend, or deſcend, or go fouth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>Here <hi>Note,</hi> That this above-mentioned paſſage was brought by <hi>T. Ellwood,</hi> in one of his late printed Books againſt me, to parallel that</p>
            <p>Antichriſtian Doctrine of <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> who ſaid, in his Truth Defended, Anſwer to <hi>W. Burnet, The Quakers ſee no need of directing to</hi> pag. 110, 111. <hi>the Type for the Antitype,</hi> viz. <hi>neither to the outward Temple, nor yet to</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, <hi>either to Jeſus Chriſt or his Blood, knowing that neither the Righteouſneſs of Faith, nor the Word of it doth ſo direct,</hi> Rom. 10. And a little after he ſaith, <hi>And where do the Scriptures ſay, the Blood was there ſhed for Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that Men muſt be directed to</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>to it? Light and Life,</hi> pag. 59, 60. But who ſeeth not, that my Words have no ſuch tendency, as
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:66443:23"/>
his, but are of quite another importance, as intimating that after we are brought to know <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt,</hi> by the inward Teaching of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> in our Hearts, that perſwadeth us, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffered in the Fleſh at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and moveth us to believe the outward Teſtimony of the Holy Scriptures, concerning <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Death and Sufferings; we need not ſay, who will go over the Seas, and bring us Tydings of him from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where he ſuffered in the Fleſh, for all ſincere <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are well ſatisfied, with the Faith they have already of Chriſt, by the inward Teſtimony of his Spirit in their Hearts, that the Scripture-record of him is ture. So that they neither need nor ſeek any other ground of confirmation, to their Faith, either of an outward Voice from Heaven, or from beyond the Sea, from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where he ſuffered; yea, a true Chriſtian, and ſincere Believer, who ſincerely believes that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſuffered for his ſins at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and has the Faith of it wrought in his Heart by the Spirit of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in him, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Teſtimony having been Inſtrumental thereunto, hath not ſo great and abſolute neceſſity, of the Scriptures outward Teſtimony, as that his Faith muſt be loſt, if the Letter of Scripture were quite taken away from him; for though the Scripture be very uſeful and comfortable to him, yet if perſecuting Infidels ſhould rob him of the Bible, and all other Books, it followeth not, that they can rob him of his Faith. And that this is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and ſignification of my Words above-mentioned, is obvious to any intelligent unprejudiced Perſon. But the Queſtion in debate there, betwixt <hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>W. Burnet,</hi> was not about the manner how the Saints are taught, as whether more by an outward Teacher, or by <hi>Chriſt</hi> their inward Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, how to believe in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or whether the Spirits inward Teſtimony, or the outward Teſtimony of the Letter of Scripture, or any outward te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Men is the more neceſſary, and greater ground of Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our Faith, but whether the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſee need to direct men, to Chriſt, as he ſuffered at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or to his Blood, as it was there ſhed for Juſtification; and as <hi>G. W.</hi> his Words further clear his ſenſe, he ſaith, <hi>Where do the Scriptures ſay, the Blood was there ſhed for Juſtification,</hi> and that Men muſt be directed to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to it? I need not inſiſt to ſhow how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralel altogether is the quotation he takes out of my Book, to excuſe the Antichriſtian Doctrine of <hi>G. W.</hi> But ſuppoſe I had been in the ſame Error with him, doth my Error excuſe his Error? But how impudent a wreſter of my innocent Words is <hi>T. Ellwood,</hi> that to make me an Apoſtate from my former Principles, he fains me, ſo far to contradict my former Teſtimony, <hi>that I am now for ſending to</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>to have Tydings of Chriſt brought from thence.</hi> But to diſcover him to be a ſhameleſs Forger, and falſe Accuſer (which are plain ſigns of his Apoſtacy from common Honeſty, in this as in many other particulars) I tell him and all his Gang and Fraternity of Falſe Accuſers, whoſe beſt Weapons to ſupport their tottering Kingdom, are Lyes and Calumnies, I am now no more than ever, for ſending to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to have Tydings of <hi>Chriſt</hi> brought from hence, for I ſeek no other outward
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:66443:23"/>
Teſtimony, not need any other, but that which began to be preached at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the holy Apoſtles of our Lord, above ſixteen hundred Years ago, and from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> came to <hi>Britain,</hi> and many other parts of the World, and that the ſaid outward Teſtimony is true, I am fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the inward Teſtimony of Chriſt, the Living Word in my Heart, which praiſed be God my preſerver, I am not gone from, neither in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple nor Practiſe, but own it and embrace it with great joy and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (that is infinitely more to me than all worldly treaſure) as much as at any time formerly, and I hope ſhall ſo be for ever. Therefore it is another abſolute Forgery and Falſhood in <hi>T. E.</hi> to charge me, as he doth, ſaying, <hi>But now being gone from the Word in his Heart, and turned againſt it,</hi> &amp;c. But why doth he think I am gone from it, and turned againſt it, becauſe I did blame <hi>G. W.</hi> his Antichriſtian Doctrine, in ſaying, <q>It was contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. to direct Men to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as he ſuffered there; and to his Blood as it was ſhed there for Juſtification.</q> Which is a groſs abuſe put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. that doth direct us to <hi>Chriſt</hi> the Object of our Faith, as he roſe from the dead, at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where he ſuffered Death, ver. 9 10. <hi>If thou ſhall confeſs with thy Mouth the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and believe with thy Heart that God raiſed him from the Dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> And as for <hi>T.

            <p>As touching divers paſſages quoted by my late Adverſaries, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>Thomas Ellwood</hi> and <hi>John Pennington,</hi> out of ſome other of my Books, as <hi>The Way to the City of God: The Way caſt up: Light of Truth, in Anſwer to R. Gordon;</hi> or any others of the like nature and importance, which they have ſought greatly to pervert, and miſconſtructure, on purpoſe to abuſe me, and make their credulous followers think my late Principles contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to my former, touching Articles of Faith: I ſee no preſent need nor cauſe, to recite them particularly one by one, or to reſcue and vindicate them by any large Anſwer, from their perverſions and wreſtings, the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages themſelves in great part, as quoted by them (abſtractly conſidered from their perverſe gloſſes) ſufficiently ſerve to clear me, that I remain conſtant to my former Principles, with reſpect to theſe great Doctrines of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and will much more clear me, if they be read and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, as they ſtand in my own Books, ſo that I think it worth menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning, what an unprejudiced and judicious Perſon, that had read their ſeveral late Books againſt me, and the Quotations they have brought out of my Books, to prove me changed in my Principles, ſaid both to ſome of themſelves, and alſo to me (He was not one called a <hi>Quaker,</hi> but of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Communion) that inſtead of their thinking to do me a diskindneſs, ſo as to prove me changed from my former Principles, from thoſe ſeveral
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:66443:24"/>
Quotations they have brought out of my Books, (they have, (though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their deſign) done me a great Kindneſs, for theſe very Quotations prove, that I have been of the ſame Principles formerly, that now they blame me for, and which they commonly call Prieſts and Profeſſors Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. And ſeeing I have in divers late Printed Treatiſes, as in my Printed Letter to <hi>G. Croofe,</hi> at the end of his <hi>General Hiſtory of the Quakers,</hi> and in my late Book called, <hi>Antichriſts and Saddnces detected,</hi> given di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers plain Explications of moſt of theſe, and ſuch like Quotations brought by them againſt me, and ſhown the good Conſiſtency of them with my preſent Faith, it would be a ſuperfluous labour, to Reprint another Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of thoſe Quotations, from their Perverſions. And here in the cloſe, I acquaint the Friendly and Judicious Reader, that if any of my above-given Explications ſeem to him in any degree ſtrained beyond what the genuine ſenſe of the Words will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap> in any degree ſtrained, he may take it, if not for a genuine and proper Explication (if ſo be it is in the leaſt inconſiſtent with the truth of the Holy Scripture) to be my plain and free Retractation. For what I cannot fairly defend by Explication, I am freely willing to correct and amend by Retractation. As concerning the late abuſive Books, publiſhed in Print againſt me, as well as the former, by <hi>T. E.</hi> and <hi>J. P.</hi> and others, containing vile Errors, in point of Doctrine, groſs Perverſions, baſe Slanders, trifling Defences in their own and others Vindication, I defer my larger Anſwer to them to another occaſion, which I hope may be e're very long, if it ſhall pleaſe God to afford it unto me.</p>
            <p>Having thus far proceeded to explain, amend and retract thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular paſſages in my Books above-mentioned, which I judged my Duty ſo to do, from true Conviction, and out of real love to Truth, I conclude with my making a general Retractation (which I do freely and humbly) of all paſſages, either in my Books above-mentioned, or in any others of my Books, not mentioned in this Treatiſe, in ſo far, as they are not perfectly conſiſtent with the holy Scriptures, and the divine Doctrines and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies delivered in them; and likewiſe I ſubmit all that I have at any time given forth in Word, Writ or Print by way of Doctrine, in Religious matter to the Teſt, Touch-ſtone, and Rule of the holy Scriptures, as the greateſt, the beſt, and moſt authentick Rule, and Standard of Truth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with all Teſtimonies, Writings, and Books of Men what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, renouncing, revoking, retracting, diſowning and denying what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is contained in any of my former, or latter Books, that doth not perfectly agree with the holy Scriptures. Which general Retractation I make for this Reaſon, becauſe it is poſſible that divers other particulars in my Books, which I have not obſerved, may need correction; therefore until I ſee other particulars to need Correction, which how ſoon I ſee, I am ready to correct. I hope this general Retractation will ſuffice. And if
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:66443:24"/>
any ſhall inform me, or ſhow me either by Word or Writ, any particular paſſages, in any of my Books, that may need further Correction and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment, they being enabled ſo to do by a divine Illumination, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſo moſt kindly, and as amoſt friendly Office, and judge my ſelf greatly obliged to be thankful unto them. But if any preſume or proffer, to make any ſeem Corrections in my Books, or paſs Cenſures on paſſages in them, without a right underſtanding, or from a ſpirit of Prejudice, or a ſcoſſing, taunting, airy, Unchriſtian Spirit, as my late Adverſaries have done, whereby they have ſhown, and continue daily to ſhow, their great Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Perverſeneſs of Spirit, they have their Reward, and they will but ſtill more and more expoſe their Folly and Enmity: for indeed ſo blind with Ignorance and Prejudice my-late Adverſaries have been, particularly <hi>Tho. Ellwood,</hi> and <hi>John Pennington,</hi> and <hi>Caleb Puſey,</hi> that the ſoundeſt Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages for moſt part in my Booke in relation to Doctrine, they have blamed and cenſured, though ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>y ſuch as moſt need Correction, they have paſt, without the leaſt cenſure. However, as my great Comfort is, that both they and I ſhall ſtand e're long before the Supream Judge of the whole Earth, to whom I have committed my Righteous Cauſe; and I do ſtill commit it, and make my humble Appeal to him, acknowledging my many ſinful defects and imperfections, for which I humbly beg pardon of God, for Jeſus Chriſt's ſake, and for all my other Sins, and hope for it, and have in meaſure the ſenſe and Faith of it, being fully perſwaded in my Conſcience, both by the divine Teſtimony of the Holy Scriptures with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me, and the divine Teſtimony of the Holy Spirit within me, and alſo by the concurrent Teſtimony of all true Chriſtians in all Ages, of the truth of that doctrine God has raiſed me up to contend for, which three are as a threefold Cord that cannot be broke, that whatever my Imperfections are in managing this great Controverſie, my Cauſe is Juſt, and my Heart is ſincere before him, ſo it is a great comfort to me, that many through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe Nations, far and near, have a good underſtanding of the preſent Caſe; and though my Adverſaries ſeek to overwhelm me with a thick Cloud of Infamy, grounded on Falſhoods and Calumnies, yet the Truth and Integrity of my Teſtimony will overcome it all, and will ſhine forth, and be manifeſt, and the Generation to come of the Poſterity of many of that People, who now account me their Enemy, and pour out Curſes and Lying Propheſies againſt me, will regard my Teſtimony, and it will be a good ſavour unto them. This truſt and hope I have in my gracious God, whoſe I am, and whom I ſerve; and it is a conſiderable advantage unto me, that ſome of my greateſt Adverſaries have acknowledged, they have nothing againſt my Morals nor Doctrine; and it is come under the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of many that hear them in their Meetings, how admirably they are changed of late, to preach the very ſame Doctrines, which formerly they have ſo fiercely oppoſed in all that were not of their way, and for which they have Excommunicated me; but they cannot be judged ſincere, until they plainly Retract their former Errors.</p>

And finally, with a free and willing mind, I make a general Retractation of all the hard Names, and uncharitable Cenſures, I have at any time, either by Word or Writ, paſt on any, differing from me in point of Judgment, that have not deſerved them, humbly deſiring their Forgiveneſs, wherein I have in that caſe juſtly offended them. And though I do (with deep regrat) acknowledge and blame my too great raſhneſs, in giving hard Names, and paſſing uncharitable Cenſures on divers, with whom I have differed in point of judgment, being engaged in the heat of Controverſie, and divers times pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by the hard Names and uncharitable Cenſures, that ſome of my Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents have given me; which provocation I ſhould not have given way to, but rather according to what the Scripture requireth, to have ſought in meekneſs, to inſtruct them that oppoſed themſelves, if God peradventure would give them Repentance; yet I was never ſo uncharitable, as to think or judge that few or none were truly Pious, or of a true Chriſtian Spirit, or that did belong to the true Church of Chriſt, but ſuch as were of the ſame outward Profeſſion with me; for the Contrary I have ſeveral times ſignified in Print, and as I have been charitable in my Judgment, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to others with whom I have diſtered, in Controverſal points, when I did think they held the Head, and built on Chriſt the true Foundation, though ſome part of what they built was but Hay, Wood and Stubble; ſo it is my reſolution, by divine aſſiſtance, to be yet more charitable in judgment concerning others that differ from me in the leſſer matters, when they agree with me in the greater, and whoſe manner of Life and Converſation is ſuitable to their Chriſtian Profeſſion. But as for ſuch who deny the Lord that bought them, and hold ſuch Antichriſtian Principles, as oppugne the great Fundamentals of the Chriſtian Religion, as I have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved my late Adverſaries to have done, the greateſt and beſt Charity that I can extend unto them, is to deal roundly and plainly with them, and give them and their vile Errors, ſuch ſit and proper Names, as they deſerve, and as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture giveth to ſuch, who were guilty of ſuch vile Errors, in former times: But the naſty and unclean Terms, and Words, worſe than <hi>Billingſgate,</hi> that ſome called Teachers among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and ſome of which are my preſent Adverſaries have given to their Opponents. I account it my mercy, that I never had the faculty of them, and yet ſo impudent have theſe my late Adverſaries been, to accuſe me for giving hard Words to ſuch, unto whom they have given an hundredfold much harder: and I have this with other great advantages over them, that <hi>I</hi> have freely and willingly Retracted them, as well as other things that I ſaw cauſe and occaſion for, which I find not that any of them in the leaſt have done, and are not like to do, until their Crown of Pride come down, and they ſee themſelves to be fallible men, having Infirmities and Defects like other Men, which I pray God, they may ſee, and find Mercy to Repent of all their Errors and Evils, before it be too late, and may have a. Heart given them of God, if not to follow me, as an Example, yet to follow the Example of other great Penitents, and obey the Command of God, that requireth every Man both to confeſs and forſake his Sins; for he that hideth his Sins, will not proſper; but if we confeſs our Sins, he is juſt and faithful to forgive us our Sins; and to cleanſe us from all Unrighteouſneſs,</p>
