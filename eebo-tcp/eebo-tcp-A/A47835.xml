            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>[<hi>IT is better to Obey God, then Man</hi>] says the <hi>Text.

for their <hi>Guides? <hi>This</hi>
               </hi> is the <hi>True Form <hi>of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
that Denies the Power</hi> of it;</hi> And <hi>This</hi> the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi>
that, wherever it takes <hi>Root,</hi> loosens the <hi>Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
of <hi>Civil Government,</hi> and <hi>Obedience;</hi> And makes
way for the <hi>Erecting</hi> of a <hi>Kingdom of Darkness</hi> upon
<hi>Those Ruines.</hi> There's a Great Deal in That same <hi>Old
Adage; [Where God has his Church, The Devil has
his Chappel;</hi>] for <hi>Religion</hi> is as well the <hi>Pretence</hi> of the
<hi>Worst</hi> of Men, as it is the <hi>Duty,</hi> and <hi>Business</hi> of the
<hi>Best.</hi> Where <hi>Satan</hi> cannot prevail for <hi>Idolatry,</hi> he'l con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
himself with <hi>Heresy,</hi> and <hi>Schism;</hi> And with the <hi>dash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
of <hi>One Altar</hi> against <hi>Another.</hi> Where he cannot <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow</hi>
the very <hi>Ground</hi> of our <hi>Faith,</hi> he'l Compound for
<hi>Liberty of Conscience;</hi> And some <hi>Plausible</hi> ways of <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guising</hi>
it. Next to the setting up of a <hi>False <hi>God,</hi>
               </hi> is the
Begetting a <hi>False <hi>Opinion</hi>
               </hi> of the <hi>True <hi>One;</hi>
               </hi> Which is
almost an <hi>Equivalent;</hi> Onely the <hi>One's</hi> a <hi>Material;</hi> And
the <hi>Other's</hi> a <hi>Notional Idol:</hi> The <hi>One's the work of our
<hi>Hands;</hi>
               </hi> And the <hi>Other</hi> of our <hi>Imagination.</hi> At this

Fancy,</hi> and <hi>Conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This may look perhaps as if I were quite Running away,
both from my <hi>Reader,</hi> and from my <hi>Business:</hi> But I am,
in truth, upon the very <hi>Point</hi> of my <hi>Subject.</hi> What was
it that Ruin'd that Vnhappy Lord, (Whose Case is the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
of this Paper; And whose <hi>Unhappy Fate, I Lament
from my Soul</hi>) but the being <hi>Bigotted</hi> into <hi>This Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple?</hi>

and <hi>Jealousies, Seditions</hi> and <hi>Conspiracies;</hi> Men that are
<hi>Drunk,</hi> will <hi>Sleep</hi> themselves <hi>Sober</hi> again. We have

are to Consider again, that <hi>This Proposition</hi> is not only
an <hi>Incentive</hi> to a <hi>Rebellion,</hi> and a <hi>Justification</hi> of it;
but it makes the <hi>Concealment</hi> of the <hi>Conspirators</hi> as
much a Point of <hi>Conscience,</hi> as the <hi>Treason it self.</hi> And
how <hi>Ridiculous</hi> then is the <hi>Pretence</hi> of <hi>Defending</hi> that by

            <head>CONSIDERATIONS
UPON A
Printed Sheet,
ENTITULED THE
SPEECH
Of the LATE
Lord Russel
To the SHERIFFS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>I Have not set Pen to Paper upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
without first consulting all the
Points of Decency and Duty, which I
thought might properly fall within the
Limits of this Discourse: As the Honour
of a Noble Family; the Quality and Misfortune
of an Eminent Person, together with matter of
common Respect to <hi>Truth, Justice, Christian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
Candor,</hi> and <hi>Good Manners:</hi> Having no other end


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95375:4"/>
in these considerations, then to do a <hi>Fair</hi> and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
Right</hi> to the <hi>Government,</hi> within <hi>that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass;</hi>
I call it a <hi>Right</hi> to the <hi>Government,</hi> because
there is not <hi>one sound Part</hi> in the whole <hi>Body</hi> of it,
from <hi>Head</hi> to <hi>Foot;</hi> if this Paper may be Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
And as the business has been <hi>Managed</hi> and
<hi>Improved, [<hi>The Cry of Innocent Bloud against
Oppression and Injustice,</hi>
               </hi>] would have been a
<hi>Title</hi> much more Suitable to the <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Drift</hi> of
it, then that which it now bears. It carries the
<hi>Face</hi> indeed of the <hi>Testimony</hi> of a <hi>Dying Man:</hi> But
yet if a Body considers either the <hi>Style,</hi> the <hi>Scope,</hi>
the <hi>Declarative,</hi> or the <hi>Confessing Part</hi> of it, there's
nothing less in't: Not so much as <hi>one Period,</hi>
without a <hi>Starting-hole,</hi> where there lyes any <hi>stress</hi>
upon the <hi>Truth,</hi> either of the <hi>Intention,</hi> or of the
<hi>Fact</hi> in <hi>Question:</hi> Now for this Vein to run <hi>quite
through</hi> it in a <hi>Constant Course</hi> of <hi>Reserve, Mystery</hi> and
<hi>Disguise,</hi> there needs no more to Prove, that it
was <hi>Designed</hi> for an <hi>Amusement:</hi> for <hi>Methods</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come by <hi>Chance;</hi> so that the <hi>Artifice</hi> is not
wholly to be <hi>Neglected;</hi> and yet I shall not lay
more <hi>weight</hi> upon't than the Thing will <hi>bear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Two Points</hi> in <hi>Consideration</hi> are the <hi>Speech</hi>
and the <hi>Paper.</hi> Now some will have it, that
though the <hi>Speech</hi> was certainly my Lord <hi>Russels,</hi>
there may be some doubt yet concerning the
<hi>Paper</hi> that went along with it. And this Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture


<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95375:4"/>
they ground upon the <hi>Ambiguities</hi> that Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur,
both in the <hi>Title,</hi> and in the <hi>Speech it Self,</hi>
which they Reason upon, after this manner. The
<hi>Title,</hi> they say, tells us barely of the <hi>Delivery</hi>
of it by my Lord <hi>Russel:</hi> And then in the <hi>Speech,</hi>
there is not One <hi>Syllable</hi> more, concerning the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
so <hi>Deliver'd</hi> than <hi>These Numerical Words [Mr.
Sheriff, I have set down in This Paper all that I think fit
to leave behind me.</hi>] My Lord does not first <hi>Read</hi>
This <hi>Paper</hi> to the <hi>Sheriff,</hi> and then <hi>Own</hi> it. My
Lord does not say [<hi>Mr. Sheriff, The Contents of This
Paper are True, in the whole, and in every part of it, So
Help me God.</hi>] My Lord does not say, [<hi>Mr. She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff,
I do here deliver this Paper to you upon my</hi> Death,
<hi>as the Truth, and the Full Truth of my Case.</hi>] But my
Lord says, [<hi>I have <hi>Set down</hi> in This Paper.</hi>] which
<hi>Setting down</hi> imports no more than the <hi>simple
<hi>Writing</hi>
               </hi> of it: And so goes forward [<hi>All that I
<hi>Think fit</hi> to leave behind me</hi>] which might have
been as well said, in this Case, if the Paper had
been an <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> instead of the <hi>Testimony
of a Dying Man.</hi> And what's the meaning again of
[<hi>All that I think <hi>Fit</hi>
               </hi>] in This Place? These Words
by a <hi>Scotch Figure,</hi> may signifie, as the Reader
pleases; either <hi>Any Thing,</hi> or just <hi>Nothing at All;</hi>
But however at a venture, a Man may conclude
that there is something <hi>More</hi> yet, which he does
<hi>Not think fit to set down;</hi> And <hi>That,</hi> for ought any


<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95375:5"/>
Body knows, may be <hi>All</hi> that is <hi>worth <hi>setting down;</hi>
               </hi>
Or (which is the same thing) <hi>All</hi> that the Reader
will find <hi>missing</hi> in <hi>This Paper.</hi> And then, why
[<hi>Leave behind me?</hi>] (they say) unless in the <hi>Literal
Sense,</hi> That <hi>I do not Carry it with me;</hi> for there's no
<hi>Attestation,</hi> Annex'd to't; No <hi>Solemnity</hi> of <hi>Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment</hi>
or <hi>Protestation</hi> to Accompany the <hi>Delivery</hi>
of it; no <hi>Circumstance</hi> to make it a <hi>Memorial</hi> of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing more than the Transferring of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
out of <hi>One</hi> hand into <hi>Another;</hi> insomuch, that
the matter lies at <hi>Fast</hi> or <hi>Loose,</hi> whether <hi>this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
shall be <hi>Reputed my Lords Act</hi> or <hi>no.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Answer is, that this Paper was <hi>Written</hi>
by my Lord, <hi>Subscribed</hi> by my Lord <hi>Deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
by my Lord; and that by these <hi>Visible Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities</hi>
it became <hi>My Lords Act.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was Manifestly <hi>My Lords <hi>Intention</hi>

<hi>Entitle</hi> him to this Paper, (how ill contriv'd soever)

and <hi>mental Reservations</hi> at his <hi>Last Hour;</hi> As

after the Closing of his Lordships Eyes, till
the Day of <hi>Judgment;</hi> But let every Man take it
which way he pleases, it comes, in my Opinion, to
the same Issue at last; That is to say, Take the

<hi>apart,</hi> 'tis much at one.</p>

            <p>This Passage now according to the sincerity of
<hi>Popular Usage</hi> and <hi>Construction</hi> is as much as to say,
[<hi>God knows it, I was ever against these ways;</hi>] but
then if a Man looks at it through a pair of <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation-Spectacles,</hi>
'tis a meer <hi>deceptio visus;</hi> and there
is nothing at all to be seen; for a body may be up
to the <hi>Ears</hi> in a <hi>Design,</hi> and yet Cry out with a
<hi>safe Conscience [God knows how far I am against it.</hi>] But
there follows another Clause that seems to come
closer a great deal, <hi>i. e.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[In the Words of a <hi>Dying Man,</hi> I Profess I know
of no Plot, either against the <hi>Kings Life,</hi> or the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi>]</p>
            <p>These Words, in <hi>plain, honest English</hi> ought to
pass for <hi>Current,</hi> and as good as <hi>Sterling</hi> betwixt

Man and Man; but he that reads them with a
<hi>Kirk Comment,</hi> will put them to All <hi>Touches</hi> and

<hi>Never knew <hi>of any Plot</hi>
               </hi>] would have been much
<hi>Fuller</hi> and much <hi>Homer</hi> to the <hi>Indictment,</hi> than [I
<hi>know <hi>of no Plot;</hi>
               </hi>] For the neck of it is now bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
and it is no longer in <hi>Being.</hi> And then in
the <hi>Restraining</hi> of that Disclaimer, to the <hi>Kings
<hi>Life,</hi>
               </hi> or the <hi>Government;</hi> There's a <hi>Salvo</hi> left
yet for the <hi>Seizing of the <hi>Guards,</hi>

to the <hi>King,</hi> short of his <hi>Life.</hi> And <hi>All This</hi>

Thus we see, Every <hi>Line</hi>'s a <hi>Snare:</hi> But I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

the Intention of him that Penn'd them, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

and without much <hi>Examining,</hi> either the <hi>Stamp,</hi> or

and <hi>Generals.</hi> Why should <hi>My Lord</hi> have these <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions,</hi>
by reason of <hi>His opposing Popery?</hi> When
the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Laws of the Land</hi>
are against Introducing the Religion of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> as much as <hi>His <hi>Lordship:</hi>
               </hi> But if the <hi>Paper
<hi>means <hi>One</hi> Popery,</hi>
               </hi> and the <hi>Law Another;</hi> (As 'tis
clear by the <hi>Context</hi> of it, that the <hi>Church-Protestants</hi>
and the <hi>Papists</hi> are to be blown up into the Air <hi>Together</hi>)
the <hi>Pretext</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> is <hi>Degenerated</hi> into a <hi>Point-blank
Sedition:</hi> And every man that Suffers for <hi>Treason,</hi> shall
presently at this rate be made a <hi>Martyr</hi> for the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</hi>
And again, will the <hi>Composer</hi> of this Paper
have my Lords <hi>Suffering</hi> in this Case, to be an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95375:10"/>
that <hi>Popery prevails;</hi> because his Lordship
<hi>foresaw the Hard Measure he was likely to have, in Case it
should prevail?</hi> Neither will the <hi>Lawfulness</hi> of <hi>opposing
Popery,</hi> in any sort, <hi>Excuse</hi> the <hi>Doing</hi> of it by <hi>Unlawful
means.</hi> There must be no <hi>Seizing of Guards</hi> in the
Case; The <hi>Fear</hi> of a <hi>False Religion</hi> is no <hi>Defence,</hi> either
before <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man,</hi> for the <hi>Violence</hi> of an <hi>Actual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</hi>
How much <hi>more Forcible</hi> then is the <hi>Condition</hi>
of <hi>Our present Instance;</hi> where the <hi>very men</hi> that
pretend to <hi>Fear Popery,</hi> are so far from <hi>Fearing it <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi>
               </hi>
that it is <hi>one Branch</hi> of the <hi>Conspiracy</hi> to <hi>say</hi> they
<hi>Fear</hi> it: A <hi>Second,</hi> to give it out, that the <hi>Papists</hi>
are about to <hi>Kill the King;</hi> And at the same time, to
<hi>Resolve</hi> to do it <hi>Themselves:</hi> And the last Round of
the Ladder, is, by <hi>Consent,</hi> so soon as ever they have
<hi>Executed</hi> the <hi>Villany,</hi> to make <hi>Proclamation</hi> that the
<hi>Papists</hi> did it. But now we come to the <hi>Deplorable
Nicety</hi> of my <hi>Poor Lords Case;</hi> which, in <hi>Appearance,</hi>
seems to be well nigh the <hi>Single Proposition,</hi> wherein
the <hi>Confessour</hi> and the <hi>Penitent</hi> agreed; And this was it,
which cost both <hi>Himself</hi> and that <hi>Noble Family</hi> so <hi>Dear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Popery</hi> was to be <hi>Opposed</hi> it seems, but not <hi>Basely</hi>
or <hi>Inhumanely;</hi> The <hi>Guards</hi> were not to be <hi>Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred</hi>
or <hi>Killed</hi> in their <hi>Beds;</hi> But if the same thing in
Effect might have been done Bravely, and Sword in
Hand, I see nothing in this Paragraph to the contrary,
but that in substance it might have been Justifyed; for
BASELY and INHUMANLY are the Two only Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that I find to the doing of it: And they do <hi>Tacitly Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi>
a kind of <hi>Approbation</hi> of the <hi>Thing,</hi> Provided it
might have been done in a way of <hi>Reputative Generosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>
and <hi>Honour;</hi> for here's no <hi>Regard</hi> either <hi>Had</hi> or so

               <hi>Bill of Exclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and shew the Reasons of my appearing in that bus'ness,
which in short is this: That I thought the Nation was in
such danger of <hi>Popery,</hi> and that the <hi>Expectation</hi> of a <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Successor</hi> (as I have said in Parliament) put the <hi>Kings
Life</hi> lik<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

which were proposed, if they were <hi>syncerely <hi>offered,</hi>
               </hi> and
had passed into a <hi>Law;</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> then would have been <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded</hi>
from the <hi>Power</hi> of a <hi>King,</hi> and the <hi>Government</hi>
quite <hi>altered,</hi> and little more than the <hi>Name</hi> of a <hi>King</hi> left.
So I could not see either Sin or Fault in the One, when all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
were willing to admit of t'other; but thought it better
to have a <hi>King</hi> with his <hi>Prerogative,</hi> and the <hi>Nation easie</hi>
and <hi>safe</hi> under him, than a <hi>King without</hi> it, which must
have bred <hi>Perpetual Jealousies</hi> and a <hi>Continual Struggle.</hi>


               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:95375:12"/>
All this I say, only to justifie my self, and [<hi>not to enflame
Others,</hi>] though I cannot but think, <hi>my <hi>Earnestness</hi> in
That <hi>Matter</hi> has had no small Influence in my <hi>present
Sufferings.</hi>
               </hi>]</p>
            <p>With Honour to my <hi>Lords Reasons</hi> for the <hi>Bill;</hi> the
<hi>Best</hi> and the <hi>Truest Reason</hi> that ever I met with for't,
was This; That the <hi>Exclusion</hi> of the <hi>Duke</hi> would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
draw the <hi>Crown</hi> after it; and that the <hi>Suppressing</hi>
of <hi>Monarchy</hi> and <hi>Episcopacy</hi> was the <hi>Best Expedient,</hi>
that ever was heard of, for the <hi>Preventing</hi> of <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
and <hi>Popery;</hi> so that the <hi>Disease</hi> was expresly <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented</hi>
for the <hi>sake</hi> of the <hi>Remedy:</hi> In the <hi>Parliament-Case,</hi>
the <hi>Kings</hi> Life, it seems, was in <hi>danger</hi> for the
<hi>Successors</hi> sake: And in the <hi>Plot-Case,</hi> the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors</hi>
Life was in <hi>danger,</hi> for the <hi>Kings <hi>sake:</hi>
               </hi> There
were <hi>Limitations</hi> offer'd (he says) but whether SYN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CERELY
<hi>offer'd</hi> or <hi>not,</hi> he makes a <hi>Question,</hi> (for
which his Majesty owes him a Thousand Thanks) but
whether the <hi>One</hi> or the <hi>Other,</hi> they were however
very heartily <hi>Rejected;</hi> and he gives This <hi>Reason</hi> for't.
They would have left the <hi>Duke</hi> only the <hi>Name</hi> of a
<hi>King,</hi> without the <hi>Power;</hi> But <hi>my Lords Prompter</hi> was
Resolv'd, that the <hi>Duke</hi> should either have <hi>All</hi> or <hi>None;</hi>
and that the <hi>Heir</hi> should be <hi>quite struck off</hi> rather than
the <hi>Crown Maim'd.</hi> Now upon <hi>This Consideration;</hi>
(and for the <hi>saving</hi> of the <hi>Prerogative,</hi> and for the <hi>Ease</hi>
of the <hi>People,</hi>) The <hi>Paper-Writer</hi> Absolves my Lord
from either <hi>Sin</hi> or <hi>Fault,</hi> in the bus'ness of the <hi>Bill;</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
upon <hi>set Purpose</hi> on his Lordships behalf, That
my Lord had <hi>Promoted</hi> the <hi>Bill</hi> before ever these <hi>Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
were thought of. Touching the <hi>Influence</hi> that my
Lords <hi>Earnestness in That matter</hi> might have upon his

of it, That there might be something in't; for the

which afterwards grew up into a <hi>Form'd Conspiracy,</hi> and
Unhapp<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

to impute any <hi>part</hi> of my Lords <hi>Sufferings</hi> to the <hi>Malice</hi>
of a <hi>vindictive Spirit,</hi> for what he either said, or did, in
<hi>Parliament,</hi> would lye open to so many <hi>Disproofs</hi> and
<hi>Contradictions,</hi> that there is not place for any man in
<hi>sound Sense</hi> so much as to <hi>imagin</hi> it. My Lord most Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately
fell into a <hi>Cabal</hi> of <hi>Male-Contents;</hi> frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their <hi>Meetings;</hi> joyn'd with'em in their <hi>Councils.</hi>
There was a <hi>Conspiracy</hi> Carry'd on, which, by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of God was seasonably <hi>Detected:</hi> My Lord, with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<hi>Apprehended</hi> upon it; brought to a Fair <hi>Tryal,</hi> the
Matter Legally <hi>Prov'd:</hi> And his <hi>Lordship Himself,</hi> not
able to Deny the <hi>Substance</hi> of the <hi>Charge.</hi> Upon This,
he was found <hi>Guilty, Sentenced</hi> and put to <hi>Death.</hi> And
what's <hi>All This</hi> to any <hi>Court-Influence of Revenge,</hi> for his
Lordships <hi>Earnestness</hi> about the <hi>Bill?</hi> But we have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up an opinion in these late Times, as if the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of an <hi>Indignity</hi> upon <hi>The Heir of the Crown</hi> were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to make a Man <hi>Shot-free,</hi> and HARD, as they say,
And that the 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. could never <hi>Touch</hi> him after.</p>
            <p>But as I was saying just now, The <hi>Faction</hi> had <hi>Two
Capital Designs</hi> in Contemplation; the <hi>One</hi> was the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying
of the <hi>Duke</hi> and the <hi>King:</hi> And the <hi>Other</hi> was

<hi>Gun-shot.</hi> The <hi>Passing</hi> of the <hi>Bill</hi> had absolutely done
the <hi>Work;</hi> but in a way of <hi>Form,</hi> and by <hi>Wotes</hi> and
<hi>Ordinances,</hi> which we have found to be every jot as
<hi>sure,</hi> as <hi>Protestant Flayles</hi> or <hi>Blunderbusses.</hi> For
<hi>One Disinherison</hi> opens a <hi>Gap</hi> to <hi>Another.</hi> And when they

it self</hi> will be found as Great a <hi>Grievance,</hi> as
the <hi>next Heir.</hi> When they are once enter'd upon this
<hi>Train</hi> of <hi>Reformation,</hi> there will be care taken that we
shall never want <hi>more work for the Tinker;</hi> till the <hi>New

within <hi>One Remove</hi> of a <hi>True Protestant Commonwealth:</hi>
There is <hi>One Question</hi> that I have put at least half a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen
times already, without Receiving so much as the
least Pretence to an <hi>Answer:</hi> And I shall offer it once a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to the Consideration of the <hi>Exclusion-Men,</hi> Let
any Man shew me <hi>One Argument,</hi> that strikes upon the
<hi>Succession</hi> of the <hi>Duke,</hi> which does not <hi>equally Operate</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>King</hi> in <hi>Possession</hi> too. For the <hi>same Popery</hi> that
<hi>unqualifies</hi> the <hi>Lawful Successor</hi> for the <hi>Inheritance</hi> of
<hi>Sovereign Power,</hi> does as well <hi>Unquallify</hi> the <hi>present Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant</hi>
for the <hi>Exercise</hi> of it: As it is an <hi>Equal Sin,</hi> in the

            </p>
            <p>Consider now again, that as the <hi>King</hi> was to be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
through the <hi>Duke,</hi> so long as matters were to be

neither do <hi>Those Distempers,</hi> in any sort, fall
within the Prospect of <hi>This Question:</hi> Beside, That <hi>this
way of Reasoning</hi> inverts the very <hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Tendency</hi> of
them: For they are here represented as a <hi>subservient
Medium</hi> toward the Advancing of a <hi>Popish Interest,</hi> when
the <hi>Contrary</hi> is as clear as <hi>Day:</hi> And that it was a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican</hi>
and a <hi>Phanatical Spirit</hi> that stir'd up, and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
All those <hi>Broils;</hi> and that they did it upon such


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95375:14"/>
               <hi>Grounds</hi> and <hi>Principles</hi> too, as shook the very <hi>Monarchy
it self.</hi> But if my Lord drew any <hi>Ill Bodings</hi> to <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>
from <hi>Those Disorders,</hi> it was by a <hi>Prophetical Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight</hi>
of the <hi>Fatal Miscarriages</hi> of the <hi>Sedition</hi> that was
then a <hi>Brewing:</hi> and of his own <hi>Unhappy share</hi> in the
<hi>Misadventure.</hi> We have spoken already to the point of
<hi>Revenge,</hi> and we shall speak further to his <hi>Lordships In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence</hi>
in the due Place; as to his [<hi>Averseness to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying
of his Innocence by Flight,</hi>] either the <hi>Inference</hi> is
not <hi>Good;</hi> or else, <hi>All Those</hi> that are <hi>Fled</hi> are <hi>Guilty.</hi> The
Paper says, that he was [<hi>Guilty of no Treason,</hi>] but the
<hi>Judges</hi> were of <hi>One</hi> Opinion, and my Lords <hi>Councel</hi> of
<hi>Another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[I know (<hi>says the Author of the Paper</hi>) I said but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
at the Tryal, and I suppose it looks more like <hi>Innocence</hi>
than <hi>Guilt.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Can it be imagin'd, that my Lord did not <hi>Defend
himself</hi> as well as he <hi>could?</hi> And it is the First <hi>Time</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
that ever <hi>saying little</hi> to an <hi>Accusation,</hi> was made
an <hi>Argument</hi> of a <hi>Man's Innocence:</hi> But of this hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and so I shall go forward.</p>
            <p>[I pray God (<hi>says the Paper</hi>) lay not this [<hi>my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation</hi>]
to the Charge, neither of the Kings Counsel,
nor Judges, nor Sheriffs, nor Jury; and for the Witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
I pity them, and wish them well; I shall not reckon up
the Particulars, wherein they did me wrong, I had rather
their own Consciences should do that; to which, and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of God I leave them.]</p>
            <p>Here's a most <hi>scandalous Defamation</hi> thrown out against
the <hi>Kings Councel,</hi> the <hi>Judges, Sheriffs, Jury</hi> and <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi>
all at a <hi>Cast;</hi> though the <hi>Manage</hi> was so <hi>Fair</hi> in
<hi>All Respects,</hi> that the <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Patience</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi>
was Acknowledged by the very <hi>Zelotes</hi> of the <hi>Party
<hi>themselves:</hi>
               </hi> They could not but <hi>Confess,</hi> that the <hi>Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als</hi>


               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:95375:14"/>
were <hi>Candid</hi> and <hi>Clear;</hi> they were heard at <hi>large;</hi>
the <hi>Proofs indubitable,</hi> and <hi>seconded</hi> by their <hi>Own Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</hi>
But I must Observe again, that this Paper makes
them <hi>Guilty,</hi> only by a <hi>Figure,</hi> and <hi>prays</hi> for them
without <hi>charging</hi> them. It <hi>Prays</hi> for the <hi>Witnesses,
[wherein they did my Lord wrong;</hi>] but he is not pleas'd to
reckon up the <hi>Particulars:</hi> Nor is it said, that <hi>they <hi>did</hi>
               </hi>
him <hi>any Wrong at all.</hi> The <hi>Penman</hi> will not charge
my <hi>Lords Conscience</hi> with <hi>Averring</hi> any thing that is
<hi>False;</hi> but he has <hi>Colour'd</hi> it so, as to make the <hi>People</hi>
Believe he had <hi>wrong done</hi> him, and that will do as well.
He leaves the <hi>Particulars,</hi> however, [to their <hi>own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
and Gods Mercys:</hi>] so that, in short, This Paper
is only a <hi>Scotch Mist</hi> from one End to the Other. There's
a <hi>bold Insinuation</hi> of <hi>Injustice;</hi> but not One <hi>Syllable</hi> in
<hi>Proof,</hi> or so much as to <hi>Colour</hi> it.</p>
            <p>But we'le put the Case now that my Lord had <hi>really
suffer'd</hi> All the <hi>Wrong</hi> he <hi>Complains</hi> of; 'tis true, it was
the Part of a <hi>Generous Christian</hi> to close his Eyes with
St. <hi>Stephens Prayer;</hi> but then the <hi>printing</hi> of That <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi>
stands in a <hi>Direct Opposition</hi> to the seeming <hi>Piety</hi> and
<hi>Resignation</hi> of it; for it lays <hi>Innocent Blood</hi> to the <hi>Charge</hi>
of the <hi>Government:</hi> And <hi>Exposes</hi> the <hi>Administrators</hi> of
it to the uttermost <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>Fury</hi> of the <hi>Multitude,</hi> as
the most <hi>Abominable Monsters</hi> upon the Face of the
<hi>Earth;</hi> and All this, without the least <hi>Thought, Hope,</hi>
or <hi>Possibility</hi> of any <hi>Other Benefit</hi> by it, than the <hi>Tearing</hi>
of All to <hi>pieces,</hi> and the making of <hi>This Paper</hi> to do the
<hi>work</hi> of the <hi>Conspiracy.</hi> Can any body think that his
Lordship would not have laid his <hi>finger</hi> upon the <hi>wrong,</hi>
if he had <hi>suffer'd</hi> any? Or that if he could (as he says)
have <hi>reckon'd up</hi> any <hi>Particulars,</hi> that he would not have
done it? He says in another Place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>I take this to be the most <hi>Remarkable Passage</hi> in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
being the <hi>Only Point</hi> that my Lord delivers upon
his <hi>Death,</hi> to be a <hi>Truth,</hi> without power of <hi>Revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
And it is done too, with a <hi>Solemnity</hi> as <hi>Dreadful</hi>
as the Contemplation of <hi>Divine Justice,</hi> and a <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

<hi>Dubious,</hi> and may be taken <hi>One</hi> way as well as <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:</hi>
But in this, the <hi>Asseveration</hi> is <hi>Positive</hi> and <hi>Precise,
i. e.</hi> that [<hi>What my Lord said of his not hearing Collonel</hi>
Rumsey <hi>Deliver <hi>any Message from my Lord</hi>
               </hi> Shaftsbury,
<hi>was <hi>True</hi>
               </hi>] We'le take it for granted now, that my
Lord did <hi>Not</hi> hear the <hi>Delivery</hi> of <hi>That Message:</hi> That
is to say, a <hi>Message</hi> from the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury, [That
it was High Time to come to some Resolution about the <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>
               </hi>
It does not therefore follow, that because My
Lord <hi>did <hi>Not</hi> hear the <hi>Delivery</hi>
               </hi> of <hi>the Message,</hi> he
knew nothing therefore of the <hi>Contents</hi> of it? His
Lordship <hi>heard</hi> the <hi>Subject Matter</hi> of the <hi>Message De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated;</hi>
And he <hi>Heard</hi> the <hi>Answer</hi> that was <hi>Resolved</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in <hi>Return</hi> to that <hi>Message:</hi> Which was in Effect,
[That <hi>Mr. Trenchard was not Ready, and therefore they
could not as yet go on.</hi>] Nay, My <hi>Lord</hi> did not deny the
<hi>Hearing</hi> of the <hi>Answer,</hi> but put the <hi>Question</hi> himself at
his <hi>Tryal, [Whether or no he Consented to that Answer:</hi>]
And <hi>Collonel Rumsey</hi> delivered upon his <hi>Oath,</hi> that he
did both <hi>Advise</hi> about it, <hi>Treat</hi> and <hi>Consent;</hi> So that it
is not the value of a <hi>Single-Hair,</hi> (if there were <hi>Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Thousand Lives at Stake upon it</hi>) whether my Lord
<hi>Heard</hi> that <hi>Message <hi>Delivered</hi> or <hi>Not.</hi>
               </hi> What's the
<hi>Meaning</hi> then of laying the <hi>Stress</hi> of his <hi>Salvation</hi>
upon't: He <hi>Purges</hi> himself of <hi>no Part</hi> of his <hi>Charge</hi>


               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:95375:17"/>
by't, but rather by the <hi>Frankness</hi> of his <hi>Protestation</hi> in
a matter of <hi>Little</hi> or <hi>No Importance,</hi> and without leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself any <hi>Room</hi> for an <hi>Evasion,</hi> he draws a <hi>Sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion</hi>
upon the <hi>Candor</hi> and <hi>Clearness</hi> of all the <hi>rest,</hi> for
it <hi>looks Odly</hi> to see a man so <hi>Wonderfully solemn,</hi> and
<hi>Particular</hi> in <hi>one single Case,</hi> where 'tis not a farthing
matter whether it be <hi>Cross</hi> or <hi>Pile:</hi> And yet at the <hi>same
time</hi> so <hi>Dark</hi> and <hi>Doubtful</hi> in <hi>twenty other Instances,</hi> where
all that can be dear to a Man of <hi>Integrity</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi>
is concerned. But the <hi>Paper it self</hi> gives the <hi>Reason</hi> of
this <hi>Different</hi> way of <hi>Proceeding,</hi> in saying that my
Lord [<hi>always detested Lying:</hi>] Upon which consideration
it has <hi>Distinguished</hi> betwixt things <hi>True</hi> and <hi>False,</hi> by
the <hi>Peremptory Strictness</hi> of the <hi>One,</hi> and the <hi>Ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
and <hi>Reservations</hi> of the <hi>Other,</hi> which is the <hi>only Key</hi>
that <hi>Opens the Meaning</hi> of <hi>this Paper.</hi> And there's ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing to be observed, which is, that <hi>This very
<hi>Truth</hi>
               </hi> was designed as a means to lead the Reader in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a <hi>Mistake,</hi> as if <hi>My Lords not hearing the Delivery of
the Message,</hi> were sufficient in Consequence, to Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
him of the <hi>Guilt</hi> and <hi>Danger</hi> of the <hi>Consultation.</hi>
My Lords <hi>Adviser</hi> has shewed himself a great <hi>Master</hi>
in the <hi>Doctrin</hi> of <hi>Probabilities,</hi> This Paper quite through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out.
There's but <hi>One plain Truth</hi> in't, and yet as the
matter is ordered, there is hardly <hi>One Falsity</hi> neither,
but it runs altogether in <hi>Appearance</hi> and <hi>Disguise,</hi> like
one of your <hi>Turning Pictures</hi> that shews you a <hi>Beast</hi>
on the <hi>One</hi> Hand, and a <hi>Man</hi> on the <hi>Other.</hi> It was
<hi>Generally Noted,</hi> that my Lord had very little to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
in his own Defence at his <hi>Tryal;</hi> and his <hi>Black
Angel</hi> has found out a <hi>Shift</hi> for <hi>That</hi> too.</p>
            <p>[<hi>I</hi> was Advised not to Confess Matter of Fact <hi>plainly;</hi>
since that must certainly have brought me within the Guilt
of <hi>Misprission;</hi> and being thus Restrained from dealing


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95375:17"/>
               <hi>Franckly</hi> and <hi>Openly,</hi> I chose rather to say Little, then
to depart from That Ingenuity, that, by the Grace of God,
I had carry'd along with me in the former Parts of my Life:
And so could Easier be silent, and leave the whole matter
to the Conscience of the Jury, then to make the Last, and
Solemnest Part of my Life so different from the Course of
it, as the using <hi>Little Tricks,</hi> and <hi>Evasions</hi> must have
been.]</p>
            <p>I cannot bring the several Parts of this Clause to a
<hi>Consistence One</hi> with <hi>Another.</hi> My Lord was Advis'd
against <hi>Confessing</hi> PLAINLY, FRANCKLY,
OPENLY. He <hi>Follow'd</hi> That <hi>Advice;</hi> And in
so doing, <hi>Minc'd the Matter,</hi> and <hi>Confess'd</hi> NOT PLAIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY
<hi>Nor</hi> FRANCKLY, <hi>Not</hi> OPENLY. That is to
say; he <hi>Confess'd <hi>Misteriously,</hi>
               </hi> and kept himself upon his
<hi>Guard:</hi> which, how <hi>Prudent</hi> soever, was yet a <hi>Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
from the <hi>Scrupulous Dignity</hi> of his Lordships Figure,
in This <hi>Paragraph;</hi> and falls within the Compass of the
<hi>Little Tricks <hi>and</hi> Chasions</hi> which I find in the very
<hi>same Period, Condemn'd.</hi> But where's the <hi>Hurt</hi> now, of
a Man's Employing All the <hi>Honest Arts,</hi> and <hi>Methods,</hi>
for the Defence of his <hi>Life</hi> that the Cause will bear?
As desiring to know the <hi>Pannel,</hi> for the purpose; <hi>Time</hi>
to <hi>Consider</hi> of it; <hi>Liberty</hi> of <hi>Challenges,</hi> and the like. But
to Descend now from This <hi>Elevated Resolution</hi> to the
very matter of <hi>Fact;</hi> I dare appeal to the most <hi>Partial,</hi>
or rather to the most <hi>Favourable</hi> Friend my Lord had in
the world, whether he thinks that <hi>his Lordship Abated</hi>
any thing of the <hi>Defence</hi> that he <hi>could</hi> or <hi>would</hi> otherwise
have made, upon the reason here Alledg'd; of keeping
up the <hi>Congruity of his Character,</hi> to the end that in his
<hi>Life</hi> and in his <hi>Death,</hi> he might be <hi>all of a piece.</hi> I must
take notice again, that it is a very Extraordinary way,
for a <hi>Prisoner</hi> at the Barr to be <hi>silent,</hi> where he has any


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95375:18"/>
thing to say for <hi>himself;</hi> And so to clear the whole matter
to the <hi>Conscience</hi> of a <hi>Jury,</hi> when in <hi>Conscience</hi> they must
Necessarily find <hi>him Guilty,</hi> if the proofs <hi>Reach him;</hi> and
that he has nothing to say, to the <hi>Contrary.</hi> And then there's
Another foul <hi>Blot</hi> too, in saying, that the [<hi>Confession of the
Fact,</hi> PLAINLY,] must [CERTAINLY <hi>have brought
my Lord within the Guilt of Misprision.</hi>] That same
[CERTAINLY] has shew'd the World the very Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the Business; for what becomes of [<hi>The Words
of a Dying Man</hi>] then, <hi>that my Lord knows of No Plot,
either against the Kings Life, or the Government</hi>] when
here's a <hi>Plain Confession</hi> of the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of a <hi>Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
and the <hi>Concealment</hi> of it? There can be no <hi>Dispute</hi>
upon this <hi>Contradiction,</hi> but the <hi>Denial</hi> must of Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
be either <hi>False,</hi> or <hi>Double.</hi> The <hi>One</hi> Pinches upon
a Point of <hi>Honour;</hi> The <hi>Other</hi> looks only like a <hi>Trial
of Skill:</hi> And so we shall content our selves to cast it
into the Heap of his <hi>other Amphibologies.</hi> (I make use of a
<hi>Hard Word</hi> for a <hi>very Ill Thing,</hi> because I would not
have the <hi>Common People</hi> understand the <hi>meaning</hi> of it.)
And it is upon <hi>This Condition,</hi> too, that the Reader shall
be at liberty to take all his <hi>Other Reservations</hi> by the same
<hi>Handle;</hi> for upon the <hi>Solution</hi> of <hi>This Difficulty,</hi> depends
the very <hi>Issue</hi> of the <hi>Question.</hi> There Remains One
Slip more yet, wherein the Author seems to have Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot
himself. There's a Reproach fastened upon his
<hi>Lordships Councel,</hi> as if <hi>They</hi> had Train'd him into a
<hi>Snare,</hi> by <hi>Misadvising</hi> him. 'Tis True, that the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
does not say <hi>expresly,</hi> whether they were <hi>Profess'd
Gownmen,</hi> or <hi>Particular Friends</hi> that gave the <hi>Advice:</hi>
But yet for the <hi>Reputation</hi> of his <hi>Lordships Prudence,</hi> it
must be understood of <hi>Lawyers;</hi> as the <hi>Only Competent
Directors</hi> that my Lord could make use of, in such an
<hi>Extremity.</hi> Who can Imagine, now, that any <hi>Lawyer,</hi>


               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:95375:18"/>
(though never so little <hi>Skill'd</hi> in his <hi>Profession</hi>) could
<hi>Advise</hi> my Lord upon <hi>Fair Instructions,</hi> and a <hi>Manifest
Certainty</hi> of what would be <hi>Sworn</hi> against him, to <hi>Smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
or to <hi>Extenuate</hi> the matter of <hi>Fact;</hi> least (as the
Paper Insinuates) it should be found <hi>Misprision</hi> of <hi>Treason?</hi>
when <hi>Effectually, This Lawyer</hi> could have told my Lord
his <hi>Doom <hi>beforehand:</hi>
               </hi> And that it would undoubtedly
have been found, not only <hi>Misprision,</hi> but <hi>Treason it self.</hi>
In which Condition; my Lords Councel, would rather
have advis'd him to have thrown himself upon the <hi>Kings
mercy.</hi> And there is more then a <hi>Tacit <hi>Acknowledgment</hi>
               </hi>
of my Lords <hi>Guilt,</hi> In several other Parts of this Paper:
But I'le take <hi>This following passage</hi> in my way to the rest.</p>
            <p>[As I never had any Design against the <hi>Kings Life,</hi> or
the Life of any Man whatsoever; so I never was in any
Contrivance of <hi>Altering the Government:</hi> What the
Heats, Wickedness, Passions, and Vanities of Other Men
have Occasioned, I ought not to be Answerable for; nor could
I Repress them, though I now Suffer for them: But the
Will of the Lord be done, into whose Hands I commend my
Spirit, and trust that Thou, O most merciful Father, hast
forgiven me all my Transgressions; the Sins of my Youth,
a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d all the Errors of my past Life; and that Thou wilt not
lay my secret Sins and Ignorances to my Charge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</p>
            <p>I shall here Recommend one special Note to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
Which is, That in <hi>Five several Places</hi> (i. e. <hi>Twice</hi>
in the <hi>Speech,</hi> and <hi>Thrice afterwards</hi>) this Paper Restrains
my Lords Endeavour to discharge himself from the
<hi>Dint</hi> of the <hi>Indictment,</hi> to the express <hi>Hints,</hi> of the
<hi>Kings Life,</hi> and <hi>Altering</hi> or <hi>Changing</hi> the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
As for <hi>Example: [God knows how far I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
from Designs upon the <hi>Kings Person,</hi> or <hi>Altering
the Government:</hi> In the Words of a Dying Man, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
I know of no <hi>Plot,</hi> either against the <hi>Kings Life,</hi> or


<pb n="36" facs="tcp:95375:19"/>
the <hi>Government.</hi>
               </hi>] And then afterwards; [<hi>I never had
any Design of <hi>Changing the Government,</hi> &amp;c.] I would
have suffer'd any thing rather then have consented to any
Design to take away the <hi>Kings Life.</hi>
               </hi>] And so again in the
Clause <hi>last above-mention'd.</hi> The Hammering of This
Point over and over, so often, was, Undoubtedly, to
strike the <hi>Deeper Impression,</hi> and to create, in the <hi>short-sighted
Multitude,</hi> a <hi>Stronger Perswasion</hi> of my Lords <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence.</hi>
But why in the <hi>Same Words</hi> still? And
with so <hi>Cautious,</hi> and <hi>Particular</hi> a <hi>Limitation,</hi> to <hi>Those
Two Articles;</hi> if it were not to <hi>Accommodate</hi> That <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
Cover</hi> to some <hi>Hidden Meaning?</hi> But the Fallacy
that's Couch'd under [<hi>The <hi>Kings Life</hi>
               </hi>] and [<hi>Alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Government</hi>] is expos'd already. It is said
here, That my Lord had no Design against the <hi>Life</hi> of
<hi>any man whatsoever:</hi> 'Tis hard to imagine a <hi>War,</hi> and no
body to be <hi>Kill'd</hi> in't: But there's a <hi>Salvo</hi> for <hi>That</hi> too;
That the <hi>Individual Person</hi> was not <hi>thought</hi> of. Neither
do I believe that my Lord ever <hi>Design'd</hi> to take away
the Life of Dr. <hi>Hawkins,</hi> though he said in his <hi>Passion,</hi>
that [<hi>he hop'd to live to see him Flead and Hung up.</hi>] That
which follows next, speaks my Lord <hi>Privy</hi> to a Great
many <hi>Ill Things;</hi> And it is not enough to say, that <hi>he
could not Repress them;</hi> For they were of such a Quality,
that his Lordship was Bound, both by <hi>Oath,</hi> and <hi>Duty</hi> to
<hi>Discover them;</hi> Or at the least, In Honour, and in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi>
to have avoided a <hi>Conversation</hi> that carried on
such <hi>Dangerous Designs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now to speak one word to that which passes for
his Lordships <hi>last Prayer.</hi> We have his own <hi>Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment</hi>
of a <hi>Misprision of Treason,</hi> And yet not one
syllable upon <hi>that Subject,</hi> in his <hi>Parting Confession.</hi> But
he that wrote this Paper is a <hi>Profess'd Enemy</hi> I perceive,
to the <hi>Christianity</hi> of a <hi>Clear</hi> Confession.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:95375:19"/>
I hope no body (<hi>says the Paper</hi>) will imagine, that so
<hi>mean</hi> a Thought could enter into <hi>me,</hi> as to go about to <hi>save
my self by accusing others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> The Part that some have
Acted lately of that kind, has not been such as to invite me
to love Life at such a Rate.]</p>
            <p>A Man shall not need to Guess twice, who was the
Author of this Sentence; for 'tis written with the very
Spirit of a <hi>Carguelite</hi> that makes <hi>Treason,</hi> a <hi>Virtue,</hi> and
<hi>Repentance</hi> a <hi>Mortal Sin:</hi> And my <hi>Poor Lord,</hi> in the
<hi>Anguish</hi> of his <hi>Thought,</hi> is left here to Answer for the
<hi>Lewdness</hi> of <hi>Another man,</hi> who, (Notwithstanding the
<hi>Justness</hi> of my Lords <hi>Sentence,</hi>) is <hi>Incomparably the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Criminal.</hi> If he ever <hi>was,</hi> or <hi>Pretended</hi> to be a <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi>
of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> (For there are <hi>Julians in <hi>Black-Coats,</hi>
               </hi>
and <hi>more Julians</hi> then <hi>One</hi> too) what could be more <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciferian;</hi>
then to turn <hi>Penitence</hi> into a <hi>Scandal;</hi> And to
<hi>Preach</hi> it for a Point of <hi>Religious Honour,</hi> in a <hi>Christian,</hi>
not to <hi>Discover</hi> his <hi>Complices</hi> in a <hi>Rebellion.</hi> Surely the
Author of this Paper was afraid of being Discovered
himself; And therefore <hi>Inculcates</hi> the <hi>Principle,</hi> and
<hi>Recommends</hi> it. Is it such an <hi>Indignity,</hi> for a man to
[<hi>Save himself by Accusing Others?</hi>] What is it then
for a man rather to <hi>Damn</hi> his <hi>Soul</hi> by the <hi>Perjurious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment</hi>
of a <hi>Traytor;</hi> then by <hi>Discharging</hi> his <hi>Duty,</hi>
both to <hi>God</hi> and to his <hi>Prince,</hi> to lay down <hi>This Life</hi> in
hope of a <hi>Better,</hi> through the <hi>Merits</hi> and <hi>Intercession</hi> of a
most <hi>Mercyful Saviour?</hi> The <hi>Pen-man's</hi> [<hi>Savin <hi>of</hi>
Himself,</hi> by <hi>Accusing Others,</hi>] is only the <hi>False Gloss</hi>
of a <hi>Reprobated Seducer</hi> upon the <hi>Text.</hi> And then the
<hi>Instance</hi> of his <hi>Reproach</hi> upon the <hi>Kings Witnesses,</hi> in this
Matter, is a <hi>Farther Discovery</hi> of the <hi>Venom</hi> of <hi>him</hi> that
gave the <hi>Dictate.</hi> This is a way chalk'd-out, not only
for the <hi>Encouragement,</hi> but almost the <hi>Canonizing</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators.</hi>
Here is an <hi>Acknowledgement</hi> however, that


<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95375:20"/>
my <hi>Lord <hi>Could</hi>
               </hi> have <hi>Accused Others,</hi> if he <hi>Would.</hi> We
shall come now to the Matter of <hi>Fact.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>[As to the Conspiring to seize the Guards, which is the
Crime for which I am Condemned, and which was made a
<hi>Constructive Treason</hi> for taking away the <hi>Kings Life,</hi> to
bring it within the Statute of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. I shall give this true
and Clear Account. I never was at Mr. <hi>Shepheard</hi>'s with
that Company but once, and there was no <hi>undertaking</hi> then
of Securing, or seizing the Guards; nor none appointed to
<hi>View,</hi> or <hi>Examine</hi> them; Some Discourse there was, of the
<hi>Feasibleness</hi> of it; And several times by <hi>Accident,</hi> in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Discourse,</hi> elsewhere. I have heard it Mentioned as
a thing might easily be done; but never <hi>Consented</hi> to as
<hi>Fit</hi> to be done, And I remember particularly, at my Lord
<hi>Shaftsburys,</hi> there being some <hi>General Discourse</hi> of <hi>this
Kind,</hi> I immediately flew out, and Exclaimed against it,
And ask'd [<hi>If the thing succeeded what must be done
next, but,</hi> Massacring <hi>the</hi> Guards, <hi>and killing them in
Cold Blood?</hi>] which I look'd upon as so Detestable a thing,
and so like a <hi>Popish Practice,</hi> that I could not but <hi>abhor</hi>
it: And at the same time, the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> took me
by the Hand, and told me very kindly, <hi>My Lord, I see you
and I are of a temper. <hi>Did you ever hear so horrid a
thing?</hi>
               </hi> And I must needs do him that Justice, to Declare,
that I never observed in him but an <hi>Abhorrence</hi> to <hi>All
<hi>Base Things.</hi>
               </hi>]</p>
            <p>My Lord was <hi>charg'd</hi> by the <hi>Indictment</hi> of <hi>High Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
for <hi>Conspiring, Compassing, and Imagining the Death
and Destruction of the King; And the Raising of a Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
within the Kingdom.</hi> Now this was a <hi>Consultation</hi>
in Order to that end: And for that which is here call'd
a <hi>Constructive Treason,</hi> It was much a Plainer Act of
Treason then any thing in the Articles against my <hi>Lord
Chief Justice Scroggs;</hi> And yet <hi>That</hi> pass'd for a very


<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95375:20"/>
               <hi>Current, House-of-Commons-Treason.</hi> The Paper <hi>says,</hi>
that my <hi>Lord</hi> was but <hi>once</hi> at Mr. <hi>Shepheards</hi> with that
Company: Mr. <hi>Shepheard</hi> swears it <hi>Twice,</hi> with the <hi>same
Company:</hi> But that Slip of Memory shall go for Nothing.
There was [<hi>No Vndertaking to seize the Guards,</hi>] it
seems; nor any [<hi>Appointment to View, or Examine them.</hi>]
That's because it was not yet come to a <hi>Resolution:</hi>
But here's no Denyal at all, of a <hi>Debate</hi> or <hi>Consultation</hi>
toward it: The Exploit was found [<hi>Feisible, and several
Discourses about it.</hi>] But said only to be in <hi>General,</hi> and
by <hi>Accident;</hi> Is it meant that they <hi>Mett</hi> by <hi>Accident,</hi>
and so fell upon <hi>Discourse</hi> only by <hi>Accident;</hi> And that
<hi>This Particular</hi> of [<hi>Seizing the Guards</hi>] fell in only as an
<hi>Accidental Discourse?</hi> This way of <hi>Disguising</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi>
is as Clear to any man that has Eyes in his head, as if it
were a <hi>Plain <hi>Confession</hi>
               </hi> of it; for if it were meant <hi>Good
Faith,</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> would have strain'd himself for <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Invocation</hi> of [<hi>the Great God, the Searcher of Hearts,
and Judge of All Things,</hi>] to bear <hi>Witness</hi> to the <hi>Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
Truth</hi> of the <hi>Case.</hi> But [<hi>it was never Consented to
as <hi>Fit</hi> to be done.</hi>] Now <hi>That <hi>Fitness</hi>
               </hi> may referr to the
<hi>Time;</hi> the <hi>Means;</hi> the <hi>Ways,</hi> the <hi>Instruments.</hi>
They had not yet Pitcht upon a <hi>Safe,</hi> and <hi>Effectual Way</hi>
perhaps, for the <hi>doing</hi> of it: But there was [<hi>More, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Discourse now of the same Kind at my Lord</hi> Shaftsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's]
And <hi>This</hi> was a <hi>Terrible <hi>General</hi> Discourse,</hi> for it
made my Lord immediately <hi>Fly out,</hi> and <hi>Exclaim</hi> against
it. I wish the Paper had set forth <hi>what this General
<hi>Discourse</hi>
               </hi> was; And what the <hi>Other</hi> was too, that <hi>fell</hi>
in by <hi>Accident;</hi> And whether <hi>that General <hi>Discourse</hi>
               </hi>
and <hi>This <hi>General Discourse,</hi>
               </hi> were not as good as <hi>all one:</hi>
But in short; <hi>Such <hi>General Discourse,</hi>
               </hi> it <hi>was,</hi> that it
wanted but one step, of <hi>Massacring</hi> the <hi>Guards;</hi> Or <hi>cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
their Throats</hi> in their <hi>Beds;</hi> which, the Paper says,


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95375:21"/>
[<hi>My Lord <hi>Abhorr'd</hi> it for, being so like a <hi>Popish</hi> Practice</hi>]
A <hi>Presbyterian Practice</hi> would not have done a miss nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in <hi>This Place,</hi> if a body had had the <hi>Murder</hi> of the
<hi>Late King; Montross;</hi> The Arch-bishop of St. <hi>Andrews
&amp;c.</hi> in his thought. But shall any man at last be so
<hi>Weak,</hi> as to swallow it, that [<hi>Did you ever hear so
Horrid a Thing,</hi>] was only an <hi>Exclamation</hi> upon a
<hi>General</hi> and <hi>Accidental <hi>Discourse?</hi>
               </hi> All the <hi>Rest</hi> went
down well enough, till it came to the <hi>Cut-Throat-part</hi>
of it. And that was the Point that Startled them: The
<hi>Doing</hi> of the <hi>Bus'ness,</hi> either in a <hi>Brave, Generous Way,
<hi>Head to Head;</hi>
               </hi> or with <hi>Cap in Hand;</hi> And a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Loyalty,</hi> and <hi>Respect,</hi> to Desire his Majesty, in
<hi>These Dangerous Times, to sign a Demise of his <hi>Three
Kingdoms,</hi>
               </hi> to the <hi>Vse</hi> of the <hi>Councel of Six;</hi> Or to a
<hi>Band</hi> of <hi>Associators,</hi> for the Security of his <hi>Sacred Person,</hi>
and the <hi>Protestant Religion;</hi> I do not find, (by any
thing I see yet) that the <hi>Men of Honour</hi> (if the <hi>Paper-Writer</hi>
might have had his Will) would have <hi>Boggl'd</hi>
at such a way of <hi>Proceeding;</hi> But the doing of the
Thing <hi>Basely,</hi> was the <hi>Business;</hi> And the <hi>Scruple</hi> that
was <hi>made,</hi> was upon a Point of <hi>Bravery,</hi> not <hi>Conscience.</hi>
But to Continue the Story.</p>
            <p>[As to my going to <hi>Mr. Shepheards,</hi> I went with an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi>
to taste <hi>Sherry;</hi> for he had promised me to Reserve
for me the next very good Piece he met with, when I went
out of Town; and if he recollects, he may remember I askt
him about it, and he went and fetcht a Bottle: But when I
tasted it, I said 'twas Hot in the Mouth; and desired that
whenever he met with a Choice Piece, he would keep it for
me which he Promised. I Enlarge the more upon This,
because <hi>Sir George Jefferies</hi> Insinuated to the <hi>Jury,</hi> as if
I had made a <hi>Story</hi> about going thither; but I never said,
[<hi>That was the <hi>Only</hi> Reason</hi>] And I will now <hi>Truly <hi>and
Plainly</hi>
               </hi> add the rest.]</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:95375:21"/>
By <hi>this Paragraph,</hi> the Reader is to be held in hand,
that my Lords BUSINESS to Mr. <hi>Shepheards</hi> was <hi>to
taste Sherry:</hi> And the Paper goes about to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh</hi>
Mr. <hi>Shepheard</hi>'s <hi>Memory,</hi> by such and such <hi>Tokens,</hi>
the <hi>Word</hi> is [<hi>with an <hi>Intention</hi> to taste Sherry</hi>] which in
<hi>common Speech,</hi> does fairly insinuate, as if the <hi>Tasting of
Sherry</hi> had been the <hi>chief End</hi> of his going; Whereas
supposing that to be in his <hi>Intention,</hi> it might be, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
yet, the least part of his <hi>Bus'ness:</hi> And further,
the Author of this Paper has not thought fit to give us
any Sort of <hi>Light, what</hi> his Bus'ness was: Nay, Mr.
<hi>Shepheard,</hi> on the other hand, <hi>swears</hi> that it was a <hi>Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi>
by <hi>Appointment,</hi> and that there was nothing of
the <hi>Sherry-Story</hi> in the Case. My Lord, however, made
use of this Suggestion at his <hi>Tryal;</hi> and Sir <hi>George Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feries</hi>
Reflecting upon it to the Jury, this Paper under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes
the <hi>Excusing</hi> of <hi>One shift</hi> with <hi>Another:</hi> The <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting</hi>
of <hi>Sherry</hi> was <hi>One Reason,</hi> though not the <hi>only
Reason.</hi> But we are now to Expect a <hi>True</hi> and
<hi>Plain <hi>Account</hi>
               </hi> of the rest.</p>
            <p>[I was the day before this Meeting, come to Town, for two
or three days, as I had done, once or twice before; having a
very Near and Dear Relation lying in a very Languishing
and Desperate Condition: And the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi>
came to me, and told me, he was extremely glad I was come
to Town; for my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and some <hi>Hot men
would <hi>undo</hi>
               </hi> us all: How so, My Lord, <hi>said I?</hi> Why (<hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
he</hi>) they'l certainly do some <hi>Disorderly</hi> thing or
other, if Great Care be not taken, and therefore for God's
sake; Use your Endeavours with your Friends to prevent
any thing of this kind. He told me, there would be <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
at Mr. <hi>Shepheards</hi> that night, and desired me to be at
home in the Evening, and he would call me, which he did:
And when I came into the Room, I saw Mr. <hi>Rumsey</hi> by


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95375:22"/>
the Chimney, though he swears he came in after; and there
were things said by some with much more <hi>Heat</hi> than <hi>Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
which I did <hi>sufficiently Disapprove,</hi> and yet for
<hi>these Things</hi> I stand <hi>Condemned:</hi> But I thank God <hi>my
Part</hi> was <hi>syncere</hi> and <hi>well meant:</hi> It is, <hi>I</hi> know, inferred
from hence, and was pressed to me, that I was acquainted
with those <hi>Heats</hi> and <hi>Ill Designs,</hi> and did not <hi>Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>
them; but this is but <hi>Misprision of Treason,</hi> at most. So
<hi>I dye <hi>Innocent</hi>
               </hi> of the <hi>Crime</hi> I stand <hi>Condemned</hi> for, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>]</p>
            <p>Here's a short Account of my Lords coming twice or
thrice to <hi>Town;</hi> and that he had a Dear Relation lying
sick here: But whether he came upon a <hi>Visit,</hi> or upon
the <hi>Bus'ness in Question,</hi> the Paper says <hi>Nothing.</hi> The
Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> Complains to him, as above, of
my Lord <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> and <hi>Other Hot Headed Men</hi> that
would <hi>spoyl all; this Implyes my Lords being Antecedently
privy to the matter in hand;</hi> for he takes the hint imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.
[<hi>How to my Lord?</hi>] (says he) without nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to Enquire either <hi>What <hi>Men,</hi>
               </hi> or <hi>what <hi>Bus'ness?</hi>
               </hi>
The Answer was no more in Effect then This. <hi>There are
a Company of mad Fellows, that will out-run the</hi> Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<hi>they will be shewing themselves too soon, and make some</hi>
Bedlam Attempt or other, <hi>before we are ready for'em, and
then we are All ruin'd.</hi> So that it was not the <hi>Design it self,</hi>
but (as This Paper Represents it) the <hi>rash</hi> and <hi>imprudent
Manage,</hi> that was taken Check at; And now follows
the <hi>Meeting</hi> at Mr. <hi>Shepheards;</hi> which this Paper calls
[<hi>Company</hi>] as if it were a <hi>chance <hi>Company,</hi>
               </hi> not a <hi>Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:</hi>
But Mr <hi>Shepheard</hi> speaks of it as a <hi>Set-<hi>Company:</hi>
               </hi>
And Mr. <hi>Rumsey</hi> was likewise <hi>appointed</hi> to <hi>meet there.</hi> My
Lords <hi>Contradicting</hi> Mr. <hi>Rumsey</hi> in a <hi>Circumstance</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any <hi>Exception</hi> to him upon the <hi>main,</hi> looks like a
<hi>tacit Admittance</hi> of the rest of his <hi>Evidence.</hi> The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
speaks further, of [<hi>things that were said by some, with


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95375:22"/>
more <hi>Heat</hi> than <hi>Iudgment:</hi>
               </hi>] but neither says <hi>who spake</hi>
them, nor <hi>what</hi> the things were; but 'tis Probable they
were <hi>Treason,</hi> by my Lords <hi>Disapproval</hi> of them: And
it would have been well, if his Lordship had at least told
the <hi>things,</hi> though without naming the <hi>Persons.</hi> It is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
that the words are [<hi>with much more</hi> HEAT
<hi>than</hi> JUDGMENT] If it had been with much more
<hi>Heat</hi> then <hi>Honesty;</hi> my Lords <hi>Disapproval</hi> would have
Reflected upon the <hi>Cause;</hi> but with much more <hi>Heat</hi>
then <hi>Iudgment,</hi> strikes only upon the <hi>Indiscretion.</hi>
The Paper thinks it hard, that My <hi>Lord</hi> should be <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd</hi>
for the things which he <hi>Disapproved,</hi> whereas
my <hi>Lord</hi> was <hi>Condemn'd</hi> for <hi>Meeting, Consulting</hi> &amp; <hi>Agreeing
to Raise an Insurrection,</hi> &amp;c. And it is the <hi>Law</hi> that Pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
the <hi>Sentence:</hi> My <hi>Lords Part,</hi> it seems, was <hi>Sincere,</hi>
and well meant. 'Tis a thousand pitties his Lordship
was not better <hi>Enformed,</hi> for People under a <hi>Mistake</hi>
may do the <hi>worst things in the world</hi> with <hi>Good Meaning.</hi>
And then methinks [<hi>Heats</hi> and <hi>Ill Designs</hi>] are too
soft a way of Expressing such-<hi>Horrible Treasons.</hi> The
<hi>Paper</hi> calls it <hi>Dying <hi>Innocent</hi> of the Crime my Lord was
Condemned for,</hi> and but <hi>Misprision of Treason</hi> at the <hi>most,</hi>
in <hi>Concealing</hi> what he was <hi>Privy</hi> to. Here is the <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi>
of <hi>Treason <hi>Implyed,</hi>
               </hi> in the <hi>Misprision</hi> of <hi>Treason
<hi>Confessed;</hi>
               </hi> And there needs not much <hi>Concurrence</hi>
with <hi>Traytors,</hi> to make a man <hi>Guilty</hi> of <hi>Treason.</hi> It is
to be wish'd My Lord would have <hi>Declared,</hi> what <hi>sort</hi>
of <hi>Treason</hi> it was that he was made <hi>Acquainted</hi> with;
whether the <hi>Imprisoning</hi> or <hi>Deposing</hi> of the <hi>King:</hi> And
by what <hi>Means</hi> and <hi>Instruments</hi> to be <hi>Executed.</hi> Once
again now, and I have done.</p>
            <p>[As for the Sentence of <hi>Death</hi> passed upon me, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but think it a very <hi>Hard</hi> One, for <hi>Nothing was sworn
against me</hi> (whether true or false I will not now Examine)

               <hi>but some Discourses about making some <hi>Stirs.</hi>

this is not <hi>Levying War</hi> against the <hi>King,</hi> which is <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
by the Statute of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi> and not the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting</hi>
and <hi>Discoursing</hi> about it, which was all that was
Witnessed against me. But by a strange Fetch, the Design
of <hi>Seizing the Guards,</hi> was Construed a Design of <hi>Killing
the King;</hi> and so I was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that Cast.</p>
            <p>And now I have <hi>Truly</hi> and <hi>Syncerely</hi> told what my

            <p>Here is enough said, to set forth the <hi>Inconsistencies</hi> of

<hi>Infinite Satisfaction,</hi> that there is <hi>Nothing Intended</hi> upon

In few words; It is a <hi>Reproach</hi> in the form of

upon this <hi>Vagabond Paper,</hi> for it fills <hi>All Mouths</hi> and <hi>Places,</hi>
I reckon it a <hi>Duty</hi> to Accompany my <hi>Zeal</hi> for the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi>
in <hi>this Particular,</hi> with all Possible <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi>
to the <hi>Memory</hi> of the <hi>Dead.</hi> The <hi>Unhappy Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances</hi>

               <hi>That my Lords</hi> Charge <hi>was <hi>Proved,</hi> and his</hi> Sentence
<hi>according to <hi>Law,</hi> his Lordship hath acknowledged
under his own Hand (whatsoever this</hi> Ill-natured Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>may Pretend to the</hi> Contrary.) <hi>In</hi> one Petition <hi>to his
Majesty, My Lord does [Solemnly Protest</hi> upon the Word
of a Dying Man, that he never had any Intention or Thought


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95375:24"/>
of doing hurt to his Majesties Sacred <hi>Person,</hi> however by
<hi>Interpretation of Law</hi> 'tis imputed to him, And if
his Majesty should be pleased to Execute <hi>the Rigour of
the Law</hi> upon him; he hoped that God would Enable him,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>] In a second Petition, <hi>His Lordship</hi> [Humbly and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfully
<hi>Confesses</hi> his having been Present at those Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
which he is <hi>Convinced</hi> are <hi>Unlawful,</hi> and justly
Provoking to his Majesty, But being Betrayed by <hi>Ignorance</hi>
and <hi>Inadvertence,</hi> he did not Decline them as he ought to
have done, <hi>&amp;c.] I have the Charity to Believe now,
that really according to the Purport of these Petitions.
His Lordships</hi> Great Misfortune <hi>was rather an</hi> Error <hi>of</hi>
Principle, <hi>then a</hi> Factiousness <hi>of</hi> Malice: <hi>And it is no
wonder, if he were somewhat</hi> deeper Dyed <hi>then</hi> Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
<hi>that had (but too frequently) most desperate</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers
<hi>at his</hi> Elbow. <hi>What was that</hi> Treasonous <hi>and</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theistical
Libel <hi>of</hi> [Julian the Apostate] <hi>but the very</hi>
Scheme <hi>of this</hi> Conspiracy, <hi>and</hi> Calculated <hi>for the</hi> Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<hi>of the</hi> King, <hi>and the</hi> Dissolution <hi>of the</hi> State? <hi>And
it was</hi> the same Poysonous Position <hi>that brought this</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
Lord <hi>to his</hi> Ruine.</p>
            <p>As to this <hi>Pernicious Paper,</hi> I make no question but
my <hi>Lord <hi>Signed</hi>
               </hi> it, and that he made it his <hi>Own,</hi> by
so <hi>Doing:</hi> But it holds so little <hi>Congruity</hi> with the <hi>State</hi>
and <hi>Exigence</hi> of his Lordships <hi>Case,</hi> that I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
(under his <hi>Anxious Circumstances</hi>) he would have
Signed a <hi>Blank</hi> upon the <hi>same Terms,</hi> if the <hi>same Person</hi>
had <hi>Presented</hi> it: For there is not one <hi>Syllable</hi> in't that
<hi>Avails</hi> him to any purpose Imaginable: It Pretends to
<hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Plainness;</hi> and yet scarce <hi>six Lines</hi> in't with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a <hi>Riddle.</hi> It pretends to Discharge my <hi>Lord</hi> of the
whole <hi>Indictment:</hi> And yet in several Places, either <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricates,</hi>
or <hi>Confesses</hi> it. It pretends to Deliver the
<hi>whole Truth</hi> of the Matter, and yet leaves out the <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi>


               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:95375:24"/>
at his <hi>Own</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hamdens</hi> House, where the
great Pinch of the Charge lay. Nay the Faction had
proceeded so far to the Captivating of this Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Persons <hi>Judgment,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Montagues Letter</hi> to the
<hi>LordTreasurer,</hi> bearing date <hi>Jan. 18. 1678. St. N.</hi> that
was Read in the House of Commons, takes Notice
how much the Court of <hi>France</hi> depended upon him,
for the <hi>Crossing</hi> (as he calls it) of the <hi>Court Measures.</hi>
[Mr. Ruvigny's <hi>Instructions are by the Means of</hi> Will.
Russel <hi>and</hi> other Discontented People <hi>to give a
Great deal of Mony, and cross all your Measures at Court.</hi>]
But to come more particularly now to the miserable
Principle that led him to his Destruction.</p>
            <p>Upon the <hi>Munday</hi> after my Lords <hi>Condemnation,</hi> the
Reverend Dean of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Dr. <hi>Tillotson,</hi> gave his
Lordship a pious and Friendly Visit: Expressing the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
<hi>Affliction</hi> as well as <hi>Compassion</hi> that he had for his
present Condition: And not without Great Admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at my Lords being Engaged in a Misfortune of that
Quality: But after a little Discourse upon that Subject,
the Dr. was much more troubled, to find that my Lord
was not only Embarqu'd in that <hi>Pernicious</hi> and <hi>wicked
Design,</hi> but <hi>Possess'd</hi> with the <hi>Principle</hi> of his Chaplains
[<hi>Julian the Apostate</hi>] that <hi>Resistance was Lawful in the Case
of Religion, Liberties</hi> and <hi>Properties being Invaded:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Dr. Applyed himself by <hi>Argument</hi> and <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel</hi>
to the setting of his Lordship right in that Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
with all the <hi>Freedom, Tenderness</hi> and <hi>Respect Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi>
And not without Flattering himself at last, that he
had gain'd his point upon my Lords Judgment, who
promis'd the Dr. at parting, <hi>to bethink himself seriously of
what he had said.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next day Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> tells the <hi>Dean,</hi> that his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
had wrought a very good Effect upon my Lord,


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95375:25"/>
and that <hi>he was now Resolved to do All that might become a
man under his Circumstances, and to Discharge his Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
both towards God and Man.</hi> Hereupon the <hi>Dean</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
himself forthwith to a Person of Great Honour,
with this Account of his Success, desiring that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
might be Represented to his Majesty, which was
done accordingly, (and the best Office, which in such a
Case the Dr. could render to his Lordship.)</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>VVednesday,</hi> the Dean gave my <hi>Lord</hi> another Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit,
when taking for granted, that his <hi>Lordship</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his Late Resolution, he entertain'd him only with
Preparatory Discourses toward the fitting of him for a
better Life.</p>
            <p>Upon <hi>Friday Morning,</hi> the Dean Administred to my
<hi>Lord</hi> the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> having previously Receiv'd such
Satisfaction from him, as the Occasion and the Duty Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd.
But afterwards, Mr. <hi>Dean</hi> finding him waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
went his way: And about five or six in the Evening
brought him a <hi>Letter,</hi> which was excellently well Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
and very pertinently Applyed to the point
in Question. The <hi>Dean</hi> Deliver'd the <hi>Letter</hi> to my <hi>Lord</hi>
and Discours'd at large upon it, Earnestly beseeching him
to Bethink himself, how much it concern'd him not to
leave the World under so dangerous a Mistake, but my
<hi>Lord</hi> seemed much colder now, than before, the <hi>Dean</hi>
however pressing him to Enter into a strict and severe
Examination of himself, and so he departed, leaving the
<hi>Letter</hi> in his <hi>Lordship</hi>'s hand.</p>
            <p>The next Morning (being the Day of his <hi>Execution</hi>)
the <hi>Dean</hi> waited upon my <hi>Lord</hi> again, when he found
him yet cooler, and utterly Declining any Occasion of
farther Discourse upon the Old Matter. Upon this, the
Dr. <hi>Desisted,</hi> and Attended him afterwards, and <hi>Pray'd</hi>
with him on the <hi>Scaffold: Discharging</hi> himself, from first

                     <hi>I</hi> Was heartily glad to see your Lordship this Morning in
that calm and devout temper at Receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but Peace of mind unless it be well-grounded will avail
little: And because transient Discourse many times hath
little effect for want of time to weigh and consider it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in tender compassion of your Lordships Case, and from
all the good Will that one man can b<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ar to another, I do hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
offer to your Lordships deliberate thoughts these following
Considerations concerning the Points of Resi<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ance, if our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Rights should be invaded, as your Lordship puts
the Case, concerning which I understood by Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> that
your Lordship had once received Satisfaction, and am sorry to
find a change.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First,</hi> That the Christian Religion doth plainly forbid the
Resistance of Authority.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That though our Religion be Established by Law,
(which your Lordship urges as a difference between our Case,
and that of the Primitive Christians) yet in the same Law,
which Establishes our Religion it is declared, That it is not
Lawful upon any pretence whatsoever to take up Arms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Besides, That there is a particular Law declaring the Power of
the <hi>Militia</hi> to be solely in the King. And this ties the hands
of Subjects, though the Law of Nature and the General
Rules of Scripture h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d left us at liberty; which I believe
they do not, because the Government and Peace of Humane
Society could not w<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll subsist upon these Terms.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Your Lordships Opinion is contrary to the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
Doctrine of all Protestant Churches: and though some
particular Persons have taught otherwise, yet they have been


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:95375:26"/>
contradicted herein and condemned for it by the Generality
of Protestants: And I beg of your Lordship to consider how
it will agree with an avowed asserting of the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
to go contrary to the General Doctrine of the Protestants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
My End in this is to convince Your Lordship, that You are
in a very Great and Dangerous Mistake, and being so convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
that which before was a Sin of Ignorance, will appear of a
much more heinous Nature, as in Truth it is, and call for a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
particular and deep Repentance; which if Your Lordship
sincerely exercise upon the sight of your Error, by a Penitent
Acknowledgment of it to God and Men, You will not only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Forgiveness of God, but prevent a mighty Scandal to
the Reformed Religion. <hi>I</hi> am very loath to give Your Lordship
any disquiet in the Distress You are in, which <hi>I</hi> commiserate
from my heart, but am much more concerned, that You do
not leave the VVorld in a delusion and false Peace, to the
hindrance of Your Eternal Happiness. <hi>I</hi> heartily pray for
You, and beseech Your Lordship to believe that <hi>I</hi> am with the
greatest Syncerity and Compassion in the VVorld,</p>

the Late LORD RUSSEL.</head>
                        <p>
                           <hi>O</hi> Almighty and Merciful God, with whom alone,
live the Spirits of Just Men made perfect, after
they are delivered from these earthly Prisons,
we humbly commend the Soul of this our dear Brother in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thy hands, as into the hands of a Faithful Creator, and
most merciful Saviour; humbly beseeching thee that it may
be pretious in thy sight, wash it, O Lord, from all it's guilt


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95375:26"/>
in the blood of the immaculate Lamb that was slain to take
away the Sins of the World; That whatsoever Defilements
it may have Contracted in the midst of this wicked World,
by the lusts of the flesh, or the wiles of Satan, being purged
and done away, by a sincere and unfeigned Repentance,
through thy Infinite Mercy and Goodness in our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ, it may be presented pure and holy, and without
spot, before thee; O Lord we humbly beseech thee to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
thy Servant and stand by him in this last and great
Contest, deliver him from the pains of Eternal Death,
and save him, O Lord, for thy Mercies sake, and grant that
all we who survive, by this, and other Instances of thy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
may learn our Duty to God and the King, and
that by this and other like Spectacles of our Mortality, we
may see how frail and uncertain our Condition is in this
World, that it is all but vanity, and teach us so to number
our days, that we may seriously apply our hearts to that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and heavenly VVisdom while we live, which may bring
us to <hi>Life Everlasting</hi> through <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> our Lord,
in whose holy Name and VVords we conclude our Prayers.</p>

Having done this Right to the <hi>Truth</hi> by an <hi>Impartial

to the Reverend <hi>Dean,</hi> to <hi>Publish</hi> the <hi>Right</hi> that he hath
done to <hi>Himself</hi> in <hi>this Affair, I</hi> shall Super-add <hi>this
Note,</hi> that he had nothing to do in the <hi>Paper</hi> that has
made all this Noise; but to <hi>Condemn</hi> so much as he
<hi>Heard</hi> of it. <hi>And</hi> in <hi>Truth</hi> it was <hi>Observed,</hi> that while
my <hi>Lord</hi> and the <hi>Dean</hi> were <hi>together,</hi> they had <hi>Neither
Pen, Ink, nor Paper.</hi> Now though 'tis True again,
that when my <hi>Lord,</hi> and Doctror <hi>Burnet</hi> were together,
there was <hi>Pen, Ink,</hi> and <hi>Paper called for;</hi> It Concludes
nothing yet as to the <hi>Writing of this Paper.</hi> It is said

            <p>There is more then enough said in Reflection upon
