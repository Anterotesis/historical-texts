            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

but that the solemnitie was reserued till his Honours comming, and therfore diuers Princes, Lordes, Ladies, and gentlemen, inuited and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to attend at the Court, and waite vpon him.</p>
            <p>And because the <hi>Prince</hi> his master had beene giuen to vnderstande, of his Lordshippes hastening (as he did, and that with the venture of his health in the seruice) he besought him, to take such easie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient iourneys as might be best for his honours prouisions by the way, and to that ende had sent him, to doe his Lordshippe all seruice and attendance. To which my Lo. making a regratulatory answere, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hauing giuen him good woordes, made him good cheere, and the next day we went fiue leagues to <hi>Heldeshem</hi> the 19. fiueleagues to <hi>Hamel</hi> (through the mountainous and pleasant woodie parte of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Brunswicks</hi> and the <hi>Bishoppe of Padenborge</hi> their lands, &amp; so we came to <hi>Hixtunne</hi> in the <hi>Stift</hi> of <hi>Corui.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>At Hixtunne</hi> met vs another ancient graue Gentle-man called <hi>Rauen von Aina luxen</hi> a dweller in those parts, and who came with no message, but was sent to bring my Lorde to a castle of the <hi>Princes</hi> called <hi>Zappenburch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Castle is seated out of common passage, built vpon a hill, in a greate forrest, whither by a craggie and vnbeaten way we came late by mooneshine. My Lord Embassador, was receiued with all honor and expectation who through the souldiers ranked on both sids (as they be very cerimonious) went in with his Coaches to the inner Court, where he alighted, <hi>Master Mezenburgh</hi> Steward of the <hi>Princes</hi> house,


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:13125:6"/>
&amp; before sent Embassador into <hi>England,</hi> with a troupe of gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Landgraues, met him at the staire foote, caried him vp by torchlight to his lodging &amp; in the greate Chamber, made a long saluting, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming, excusing, reioycing, and thankfull ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>Princes</hi> behalfe, which in few words was fully answered, and so we went to supper. The <hi>Princes</hi> Officers and gentlemen were appointed to waite, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie <hi>Master Mezenburgh</hi> sat with my Lord &amp; his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie to gouerne the table. His Lordshippe was serued with three courses after our fashion very ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully &amp; so were all his seruants to the meanest, with distinction of diet &amp; great regard was had. And this action was in all things as honorably, as wisely, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and exactly well performed, as was possible, for what the country did aford his Lordship had, or they could deuise by art, and order discreetlie was donne to honour him, insomuch that his entertainement as honorably as passed measure, as his bountie wisely kept proportion.</p>
            <p>Heere his Lordship staied three daies, which was so apointted for his better disposition &amp; refreshing, the first day he rested, &amp; the second was the day of rest, &amp; a latine sermon was made him: in the morning vppon Monday the weather brake vp, and for after dinner a hunting was appointed.</p>
            <p>From the Castle we passed a league downe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, into an open vallie, where the length of halfe an english mile, the Toyles were sette vp on both sides to keepe in the game: the pleasure of the place, was as much as the sport, for we were in sight of diuers Towns &amp; villages, as <hi>Quiddelburge, Rottam, Kellam, &amp;c.</hi>


               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:13125:7"/>
&amp; from the hil <hi>Schoneberg</hi> (a faire hil) out of the wood, fell the game downe into the vallie, where in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest, was a greene tent of cloth, set vp for my Lord <hi>Embassador</hi> with a rewe of bowes, to shaddowe the companie, hide their dogges and losen them at the deere as they passed by, the country was vp on both sides of toyles vpon waggens, with their broade bore speares and doggs: in halfe an howre, six stags &amp; two wild swine, which were the more spared for being out of season, were cruelly murdered &amp; so the slaughter ceased &amp; master <hi>Meze<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>burgh</hi> taking his leaue went to prouide, at <hi>Cassel.</hi> Thus loue &amp; bounty still went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore vs in preparation and the next day we followed.</p>
            <p>The Princes owne coach couered ouer with a large carpet of blacke veluet, and laid with long cuishions drawen with 6 horse, driuen by two Coachers suted in greene, after the maner of the Princes of <hi>Germanie,</hi> was prepared for my Lo. &amp; his own english Coach to follow with 6. horse empty, except his Lord apointed any to go in it, six besides were made ready for his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> panie, and thus prouided with waggans for our cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adges, readie set forward, the Princes gentlemen tooke their horse, being gallantlie mounted, and with conuoy of the souldiers in the Castell, whome my Lord had rewarded, we were caried through a parke adioyning, a league out of the forrest, where with a volly of shotte they tooke their leaues, and so went backe to <hi>Zappenburch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We had 3 leagues to <hi>Cassell,</hi> &amp; within one, the way was strowed at our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming with horsemen, that put forward to meete my Lord <hi>Embassador,</hi> and still our companie increased, who went the neerest way ouer


<pb n="11" facs="tcp:13125:7"/>
meadowes, the ditches leuealed and cut downe for the purpose, great expectation there was on both sides, and we were not frustrated, for within an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish mile off the towne, vpon a rising ground piked out, going vp the hill, we discouered first a straunge fellow mounted vpon a Cammell, with the manner of a herald before him, this was a blackmoore of the Princes, sent a little on the one side before, to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer our comming, and appointed to looke backe for a watchwoord, which when he had done, and knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led downe a farre off, to my Lord Embassador with his beast, like to a cloud rising aboue the sunneafter her set, betweene the light and vs, appeared a troupe of horsemen comming vp the hill, who in a statelie manner trotted toward vs.</p>
            <p>They were thus marshaled, threescore swarte Rit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters three and three in a ranke sternely came before, there followed sixe trumpets in the Princes colours white and red, after came a gallant sort of gentlemen euery way well and richlie appointed with iewels, and most of them chains of gold, there followed his emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie horses of honour and maintenance, belonging to his fendatorie <hi>Graffchafftes,</hi> caparisonned with white and red tafetie, with plumes and all their furniture sutable, after these six hincshmen two and two suted alike with chaines, helmets and iauelins in their handes: then came the Princes and the nobles and Master <hi>Dorstetell</hi> (going before the Dukes of <hi>Hostein</hi> and <hi>Luneberg,</hi> who were sent to meete the Lorde Embassador,) staied the troupes, which had passed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long sidewise of vs, till these Princes met, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting, my Lord went out of his coach, and this Master <hi>Dorstetell</hi> came and made his speach in Latin,


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13125:8"/>
full of receit, loue, and curtesie, shewing that these Dukes were sent to meete and entertaine his Lo. by the way and to accompany him to the Princes house, which his Excellencie desired him to vse for his bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there as his owne, for which my Lord thanked the Prince verie kindlie, and after hauing embraced the yoong Dukes, he was intreated to take horse, and they set forward, the great ordinaunce discharged, &amp;c. and with all pettie complements and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies such as Princes vse for ornament, and to make (as their persons are, so their actions to be more esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the common world) we entered with as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie hitters behinde as before, the whole number be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neere 300. horse, into the towne of <hi>Cassell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They were vp in armes, the captaines &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panies of the town sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding in order on both sides of the streets, stoutelie picke and gunne, euen to the Princes <hi>Castell.</hi> this his troup dismounted and gon in, my Lord was brought to a statelie vpper hall, where at the doore the <hi>Landgraue Maurice</hi> met and embraced my Lord Embassador. And in this honorable assemblie he deliuered his Embassage and his letters, to whome the Prince spake Latin, and after gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious entertainementes giuen, caried him to his lodgings, putting my Lord before him, where after all behauiour becomming so great a person, and wherein he had verie extraordinarie grace and facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie he left his Lordshippe.</p>
            <p>His lodgings were fiue rowmes, which tooke vp one end of his house, being a goodlie quadrangle, somewhat more in length then in breadth, and like the <hi>Loner</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> hie and statelie, he had two dining chambers, two drawing, and betweene these two, his

bed chamber, for his more priuate and quiet being. His Lord. owne dining chamber was a very curious roome, made no doubt of purpose, to entertaine strange Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, all of marble, the doores, the flower, the sides, windowes, roofe, and all things pertinent being of carued gray marble, and for the rarenesse, I will more particularly describe it.</p>
            <p>The doores are bordered about with timber to keepe the stone together, and comming in, the flower euen and smoothly paued, the chamber iust square, the sides made like a wentscot, with crestings, indentments, and Italian piller woorke, and heereby deuided into 27 panes of carued Imagerie, to the halfe proportion of a man, bearing vpon their shoulder points, escouchons with the blasoned armes of his signories, the electors count of <hi>Palatine</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxonie, Mararquish</hi> of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> and other houses of his friends and allies of the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant part, ouer these an other course of indented doors and carued hollow woorkes distinct with pillers, and in this compasse next the roofe, on the fower sides fower stories carued, of the <hi>creation,</hi> the <hi>passion,</hi> the <hi>resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> and <hi>iudgement</hi> verie cunningly done, in length a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two yardes, compassed in with a frame of marble, as though they hung loose, the roofe is wrought with knot worke, and thus to see to being in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber nothing but marble, whereof he hath the mine in his country, the trouble of his rowme is great in winter when to keepe the stone from cracking and loosening, the stone is continually kept hotte.</p>
            <p>The next rowme to this was a faire square chamber hung with tapestery, where the gentlemen dined, for commonly at the marble table, where the Dukes of <hi>Holstein,</hi> and <hi>Luneburgh,</hi> or the <hi>Granes</hi> of <hi>Nassaw,</hi> and of


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:13125:9"/>
               <hi>Zolmes,</hi> with Sir <hi>Richard Fines,</hi> Master <hi>Brakenburie,</hi> and others as it pleased his Lo. to appoint.</p>
            <p>The third was a faire drawing chamber, seated round about, and couered with scarlet, aboue the seates hung round, with a rich smale wrought tapesterie of an ell broade, of <hi>Embleme</hi> worke, and verses written vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, ouer this vpon a ledge of wentscot were diuers large tables of sundrie deuises well painted with their posies to garnish the chamber, and among al, that was the best which had this <hi>Motto (Maior autem horum est cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas,</hi> for it waxed cold. The roofe was likewise flourished with painting &amp; deuises, these rowmes had the through light of fower faire windowes, and in this chamber were two square tables, one richlie couered with a carpet of cloath of gold, and the seate laide rounde with fower long cushions of the same, which was extraordinarelie couered morning and euening for breakefast and ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, two of the Princes groomes appointed alwaies to be heere and waite, and heere they sat somtimes in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference and counsell.</p>
            <p>Next to this was my Lords bedchamber, with two fair damaske field beds, prepared for my Lorde and master <hi>Edwarde Clinton</hi> his sonne, the pariture of this rowme, was a painted tree that grewe vp at the doore, the bodie bulking out very naturally of stone painted barkelike, and the braunches spreading all ouer the see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the chamber, full of fruite, and hanged downe vpon the walles, with other pictures to fill vp emptie places. The storie taken out of <hi>Daniell.</hi> There his: Lo. had at a little fide table, delicate preserues and conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues set and couered ouer with a vaile of laune wrought with gold and silke, and all thinges for his chamber ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie fitlie.</p>
            <p>

               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:13125:9"/>
Beyond these fower was there a faire drawng cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber hung with arras, which parted his honours lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the other side of the house, that so he might not any way be disturbed. And now I speake of lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, I wil discribe the manner, the strength, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience of the Princes whole lodging, being a thing worthe noting &amp; then returne vnto his entertainment.</p>
            <p>His Castell standing vpon the riuer of <hi>Fuld</hi> betwene the two sides of <hi>Casse</hi> ioyned with a bridge of stone generrally commaundeth the towne &amp; countrie, and is particularly fortified for his owne dwellinge, for the first. A parcell of grounde of som 100 yeardes broad he hath inclosed, on both sides, which compasseth the towne &amp; yet is impropriat any pleasure or vse of his owne, As for his walks, orchards, laying in his prouisi ons of wood, &amp;c. vpon the cuntrie, this is storngly fortifi ed, moated, countermured, mounted, bulwarkt, flanke red, and withal possible fortification made so strong, as he is there by easily able to preuaile against the seige of any outward enimie, and beat them from the fielde, vpon the towne, onlie shut vp with a single wall, to keepe it priuate from the townes-men, that they may entende their streetes houses and trades, standing more vpon the credit of their good seruice, then their libertie: Within this place, he hath a goodly armorie not much inferiour to the Duke of <hi>Saxonie</hi> where his ordinance, armor, weapons, and munition, are kept in greate good order and readinesse vpon any occasion, all stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagemicall engines and deuises which belong to offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue or defensiue exploites.

            <p>For his priuate dwelling, his Castle is deepe and broade moated, to countergarde his house within the towne, where vpon the rampers twentie and fower are appointed to keepe continual sentinel in order, his gates ar kept with a double garde, and two bridges, drawne vp euery night and garded, the inward part as I saide a square long court, paued and vated rounde aboute with a large greate vaute vnder grounde, which is vsed for his sellerage, full of vessell twentie, fortie and some of an hundred tunne, the lower rowmes are the Offices; on the right hand a common large great hall, and other common roemes and lodgings; on the left, the middle storie was vpon our side the vpper hall where his excellencie met my Lord Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, on the right side a verie goodly greate Chamber &amp; on the left a gallerie answerable, which <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Landgraues</hi> father addorned with the pictures of all the Princes of Christendome from Anno 60. vnto 88. the number of 140.</p>
            <p>The third storie are faire lodging Chambers rounde about the vpper end from the top to the bottom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being the Princes owne priuate lodgings ioyning v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Chappell. The fourth and fifth stories for gentlemen seruants, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>On the backe side he hath faire tilt yards places for the Quintine, the running at the ring, rideing, and other exercises for his pleasure, gardens, with banqueting houses, artificiall fountaines, and water workes, fish ponds &amp;c. With his housed gardens of

            <p>But to his intertainement where I left, my Lord af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an hower resting in his Chamber, the Prince sente two principall of his Counsell, to salute him and to know his Lor. pleasure, where hee woulde suppe, wishing rather if it pleased him, to keepe his chamber, after his trauaile then otherwise, and to appoint what hower he would for sermon the next day, which he did at nine.</p>
            <p>In the morning master <hi>Brackenburie</hi> appointed the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the chappell for the solemnitie, and Doctor <hi>Gregorius Schonfelt Concionator anlicus Cassellanus,</hi> who suceeds master <hi>Eartholomaeus Meyer</hi> in his supreme perintendencie preached, his sermon was brought ouer.</p>
            <p>At the solemnitie my Lord was very richlie and well appointed, as became him, to her Maiesties honour, and his owne, and their admiration, sitting alone on the right side of the Chappell, in a place prepared for him within a trauesse of the Queenes, the row me hung with crimosin tafetie, with chaires and cushions of crimosin veluet, ouer against him satt the Prince, with the Dukes of <hi>Holstein, Lune, Burg,</hi> and the <hi>Graues</hi> of <hi>Zolmes, Nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw</hi> and others, who did him all the sermon time greate reuerence by much standing, His Lor. performed it gratiously and master <hi>Brackenburie</hi> her Maiesties Gentel manusher stoode all the sermon time at the turning vp of the trauesse, and with alowe reuerence gaue him first his praier booke which master <hi>Cotton</hi> of the warde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe had readie, after sermon they proceeded to the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnitie, and first came master <hi>Edward Clinton</hi> taught by

When this was performed in the middest of the chappell, vpon a little pause, my Lord Embassador ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with this honorable traine, went towardes the Princesse her chamber to present the gift, whither before we came: we first passed through (in an vtter chamber) a garden of faire yoong ladies and gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men clad in colours, who stoode like the rainebow, and they co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>passed the one halfe of the roume by which we passed into the <hi>Princes</hi> her bed cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, where were none but Ladies, &amp; a solemn presence. First stood three of the <hi>Landgraues</hi> sisters, the Ladie <hi>Anna Maria,</hi> holding the princes little sonne <hi>Otto</hi> by the finger.

the most effectually, &amp; affecttionately he could. He staid not there an hower, but <hi>Barriers</hi> were in hand, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing set crosse the courte, all these states were at windows to see them aboue, and when the Iudges were set below, there came in two ensignes of pikes and shotte, that compassed them round, to keepe the peace, then came 15 to 15 Knights the one side in gilt armour, the other in siluer, who taking vp their ends, the herauld red their orders, and they went to their sporte, first with the speare, then the sworde, after pele mele and brake a maruelous deale of Iron worke, and while these hott Knights were swetting in their harnesse issues such a furious Ambuscado of crackers that flewe out of the barre painted ouer greene to hide the treason, that it parted them. This quarrell ended without bloudshed, &amp; iudgements giuen, the Herauld proclamed triumphs for the day following, &amp; the companie full of the pleasure, loue and honour of this solemne meeting dissolued, the Prince withdrewe, and my Lo. was priuate.</p>
            <p>The next day the Prince sent my Lord by the High-marshall M. <hi>Benneberge</hi> his good morowe, as hee did alwayes sometimes by one sometimes by an other greete him with honourable salutations twice or thrice a day, &amp; the <hi>Graue</hi> of <hi>Zip</hi> was appoynted to accompany my Lo. who being a fat corpulent man, had little to doe at their actiuities, after dinner his Lo. was caried to the Tiltyard, but without the Prince, hee was so busie about his sports, marshaling other men, and putting him selfe in order, beeing an actor in them the more to honor her Maiestie and the day. The first Triumphes were the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at the ring, wherein they had extraor-dinarie deuise of three circles wrought the one within the other with a Crosse parting them, and making differences of hitting,

There came in first with sixe staffers and sixe Trumpets masked with their deuise the two Chalengers <hi>Mastrr Deuet</hi> a verie proper horse-man and <hi>Master Dorstetell</hi> a Councellour, who ranne with all the rest and last one with another for the prise, then came there seauen Companies, which made seuerall entran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: first with musicke then with deuises, their Launce bearers and them selues following, and last their seruants and their emptie trapped and Caparisoned horse.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Luneburgh</hi> brought in the <hi>Seauen deadlie Sinnes,</hi> and hee placed pride (indeed he vsed vs somewhat strangely) then came in an other compaeie with the <hi>Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> and another with the <hi>Nine Muses,</hi> one came in <hi>Post</hi> two masked like the <hi>Sunne</hi> and the <hi>Moone</hi> whose de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise was the <hi>Seasons</hi> of the <hi>Yeare</hi> but of all the <hi>Vnbekent rit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> came in like a Prince with his musicke of Sackbotes &amp; Cornets clade in greene Tafetie to the ground sixe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and sixe behinde, with the most harmonious noyse that could be, answering one another like an <hi>Eccho.</hi> This kinde of musike had a princely ayre, his deuise was or might be fitlie, the fowre Cardinall vertues, carying the globe of the earth and sphere of heauen among them, &amp; Consulting who after came himselfe masked like Ioue, ri ding all in white crowned, and with a tripertite sworde in his hand vnder a Crimosin Canopie borne ouer him, whereon was written at the two endes <hi>Pramia bonie, &amp;</hi>

            <p>After supper as their manner is vpon a triumph day there was a daunse, in the gallerie I spake of.

            <p>After the first setting in, there was a summonning of Knights that were to receiue fauours of their Ladies, either for their good runninge or their deuises that day. And when they had first been thanked, with commendations of their doing and exhortation with inioyment giuen them that as they had donne that by way of exercise and pastimes, to honour the Prince and Ladies, so they shoulde be ready indeed vpon iust occasion to shewe their manhoode in the defence of


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:13125:13"/>
them both and of their countrie, after they receiued some reward, and with a cranse with their Ladies gaue daunses with them, when these honours were donne the well deseruers this day, the triumphs for the next day were published, but to auoide satietie they were discreetely referred to the day after, a day of pause was put in betweene both, wherein they mett in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. Thus entergreabley the time was passed and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Saterday the twentie seauen of August the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall deuise and triumph was performed.</p>
            <p>There came in the morning an Embassadoure from the countie Palatine, <hi>Dereon Sehenberg</hi> who came to inuite the <hi>Landgraue</hi> to be godfather to the <hi>Paltz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue</hi> sonne and heire, there came in the afternoone in the middest of their sportes the <hi>Paltzgraue</hi> of <hi>Zue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ienburch</hi> with his Ladie and his little sonne but their comming was, onelie to see the Lord Embassadour.</p>
            <p>Without the towne there was a castell: builte, and the water drawne from the riuer to moate it about so broade that it bore a boate to and fro, the place for standings and perfourming of this sporte was railed in and made conuenient, and the substance of the matter was, of an enchaunter that had forsooth dwelte there long, and by two or three giants in his castell taken diuers prisoners Knightes and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and by his doings much endammaged his countrie, wherevpon the Knightes of <hi>Hessen</hi> put them selues in armes and apointed a day for the incounter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the giants and the rasing of the castell, and the giuing libertie to a faire Ladie that was prisoner there, nowe for their defence they kept open tent and hunge out the Flagge of defiance to all knights that passed, who if disposed might by the sounding of


<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13125:14"/>
a horne first come in, and trie their valours and their fortunes, for by both these this Ladie was to be deliuered, and not otherwise, for triall of their dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teritie and valour there were fower thinges to doe, first to runne at the Quintin. Next the turney. Then the tilte without a pale: and last the sword and target wherein if the knight were at any ouercome he was prisoner, and for their triall there were Iudges, if he went through, yet had he a pointe of destinie to proue, whether it were his fate forsoth to drawe the enchaunted sworde out of a piller that stoode by the castell.</p>
            <p>The Knights of <hi>Hesse</hi> came at their daie appointed, not to make deuises but to shewe their manhood, they were many and verie gallantlie armed and kepte in such order as (which graced the triumpth) there was alwaies a continued sporte, without intermission or losse of time and three or fower actions to be sene at once. The places were deuided with railes and as one thing was donne, there were wilde fellowes that lose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the chiane of the outer gate and let them by degrees vnto the but castel, the fats had apointed it for the <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Luneburgh</hi> who drewe out the sworde, deliuered the Ladie, and brought out a straunge vgly companie from the castell which being gone the fire workes began for straungenesse and admirable deuice exceeding all the rest, some for mounting, some burnning in the water, som for their straunge tearing of the aire vpright, some turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heere and there after an hundred fashions, brustinge out into such noyses and spectacles, as though heauen and earth had gone together. These and the rest were surely princely vanities, but betwixt iest and earnest there were two coronets of horsemen set to keepe the feelde, while these things were a doing, for it was late and night


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:13125:14"/>
before they ended.</p>
            <p>Thus full of entertainment it was time for my Lord (as he did wiselie) to speake of parting &amp; not to put this royally minded Prince to too great trouble, who was within fewe daies to goe to <hi>Amberg</hi> and to meete the <hi>Paltzgrane.</hi> There shoulde haue been a daunse this night as before, but being late it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in like manner as I tolde the next day being Sunday when the Prince, my Lord, the other Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador, the <hi>Paltzgraue</hi> of <hi>Zueinburch,</hi> and his La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die dined together in the <hi>Landgraues</hi> great chamber after a priuate &amp; domestical manner, for by this time the extraordinarie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany was retired, the <hi>Landgraue</hi> supped with him in the Marble chamber wher he told him as it was giuen out before, that the next day morning he ment to ride abroade a hunting with his Lordshidpe.</p>
            <p>Before they set out the <hi>Landgraue</hi> rode with him about his fortresse, shewed him the secret places of it, with his armorie appointing dinner to be serued in the garden at the banquettinge house, after in a barge we crossed the water, where were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ready and the Prince went that night tewo leagues to <hi>Milsungen,</hi> wher he reioyced and was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding merrie full of state and grace in speach and beheauiour, his answere vnto my Lord I noted who saying to him vpon occasion that the Prince of <hi>Hessen</hi> was not there and therefore woulde he be the bolder.

            <p>First a goodly personage, of stature tall &amp; straght, for his proportion, of a good presence and a gallant countenaunce, manly visaged, with a faire big blacke eie, deepe aburne haire, comlie in behauiour, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and presuasiue in speach. And this bodie hath a minde sutable vnto yt.</p>

His education prince-like, generally knowen in all things, &amp; excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in many, seasoning his graue &amp; mor important studies for ability in iudgment, with studies of pastime for retiring, as in poetrie, musike, and the <hi>Mathemitikes,</hi> and for ornament in discourse in the languages, <hi>French, Italian &amp; English,</hi> wherein he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert reading much, conferring and writting much he is a full man, a readie man, an exact man, and so excellent a Prince that a man may say of him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out flatterie as <hi>Tullie</hi> did of <hi>Pompey, vnus in quo summa sunt omnia,</hi> and for my priuate opinion I thinke there are but fewe such men in the world.</p>
            <p>His experience in all good courses greater then his yeares, though for the inconstancies, aduantages, and courses of the bad world, it increase with time in all men.

            <p>After his entertainmentes here at <hi>Rotenberg,</hi> he would gladly haue caried my Lord Embassador to his best house at <hi>Smalecole,</hi> for as he is goodnes without end vnto his subiectes, so shewed he loue without end to her Maiestie, but his iourney of <hi>Amberg,</hi> woulde not permit it, therefore we returned back by <hi>Spauengberg</hi> from whence he suddainly went from vs before, where at we maruailed but coming to <hi>Cassel</hi> he met my Lo.
