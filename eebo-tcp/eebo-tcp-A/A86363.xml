            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Yet could I have but that happineſs, as to fight for my life, and to encounter an Enemy in the field, it would be an infinite comfort, and joy of ſpirit to me. But bleſſed be the Name of the Lord, that he hath given me an humble ſpirit in theſe my dayes of Tribulation, and a heart of repentance to bewail my former courſe of life: For every wrong I have done (called now to remembrance) wrings drops of bloud from my heart; although I never ſhed one: Neither did I ever take the worth of a peny from a poor man; but at what time ſoever I met with any ſuch perſon, it was my conſtant cuſtom, to ask, <hi>Who he was for?</hi> if he reply'd, <hi>For the King,</hi> I gave him 20 ſhillings: but if he anſwer'd, <hi>For the Parliament,</hi> I left him, as I found him. As for any other Exploits ſince 1649. I am guiltleſs of: For in the ſame year, <hi>May</hi> 2. I departed <hi>England</hi> (as appears by my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion

            <p>On Munday being the 10 inſtant, by Order from the Right Honourable the Councel of State; the ſaid Captain <hi>Hind</hi> was brought to <hi>White-hall,</hi> where he was examined before a Committee; and divers queſtions put to him, in relation to his late Engagement with <hi>Charles Stuart;</hi> and whether he was the man that accompanied the <hi>Scots</hi> King, for the furtherance of his eſcape.</p>
            <p>To which <hi>Hind</hi> anſwered, That he never ſaw the King, ſince the fight at <hi>Worceſter;</hi> neither did he know of his get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the field; but he was now glad to hear that he had made ſo happy an eſcape, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After ſome time ſpent in taking of his Examination, it was ordered by the Committee, that he ſhould be ſent pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner to the <hi>Gate-houſe,</hi> till the further pleaſure of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of State was known therein; which accordingly was done, and the ſaid <hi>Hind</hi> was guarded from <hi>White-Hall,</hi> to the aforeſaid priſon: with 4. files of Musquetiers, where he remained in ſafe cuſtody that night.</p>
            <p>The next day being Tueſday he was remanded back from thence (by ſpeciall Order and Authority from the Councel of State) to Newgate; and accordingly was brought in a Coach with iron Bolts on his Legs; and Cap. <hi>Compton,</hi> and two other Meſſengers belonging to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel to guard them: And about two of the clock in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon they brought him to the ſaid place, where Capt. <hi>Compton</hi> ſhewed the Maſter of the priſon an Order of the Councel for his commitment; and alſo cloſe impriſonment, and to let no perſons whatſoever to have acceſs to him. This Order was accordingly obſerved: But during the time that the Hole was preparing for him, and the three ſouldiers removed to another place, that were in it before, for miſdemeanours of great concernment; divers perſons frequented the place to ſee him, asking him ſeverall queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: To whom he returned very civill and mild anſwers:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:165991:4"/>And amongſt the reſt, a Gentleman came to him, born in the ſame Town that he was, <hi>viz. Chipping-Norton;</hi> who took acquaintance of him, and ſaluting him, ſaid; <hi>Truly Countrey-man I am ſorry to ſee you in this place.</hi> He anſwered, <hi>That impriſonment was a comfort to him, in ſuffering for ſo good and juſt a Cauſe, as adhering to the KING.</hi> His Countrey man reply'd, That to morrow (being Wedneſday) he was to return home, and that if he had any thing to recommend to his wife, or friends, he would communicate it: <hi>I thank you Sir</hi> (ſaid Hind) <hi>Pray remember my love to them all, and certifie them, that although I ſhall never ſee them more in this world; yet in the world to come, I hope we ſhall meet in glory.</hi> Then the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman took a Glaſs of Beer, and drank to him; which he pledged about half; And filling up his Glaſs, ſaid; <hi>Come,</hi> (taking the Gentleman by the hand) <hi>here is a good health to my Maſter the King; and God bleſs and preſerve his Majeſty:</hi> But the Gentleman refuſing to drink the ſame upon ſuch an account, moved <hi>Hind</hi> to paſſion, who ſaid; <hi>The Devill take all Traytors: Had I a thouſand lives, and at liberty, I would adventure them all for King</hi> Charles; <hi>and pox take all Turn-coats.</hi> Forbear Sir, replyed one of the Keepers, and be not in paſſion.</p>
            <p>Not in the leaſt, I am free from it; but I could wiſh more love and loyalty amongſt you all: As for my own part, ſhould I live a hundred years, I would not flinch from my principles; and then immediatly (his time being ſhort) he again ſpake as followeth:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Well Gentlemen!</hi> This is all that I have to ſay to you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I go to my captivity: I deſire all men to be true to their Truſt, and to ſtand firm &amp; unmoveable to their principles; and thoſe that have laid a foundation for their King <hi>(moving his hat)</hi> let them endeavour to raiſe it; and thoſe that are on the contrary party, let them ſtrive to level it: As for my part, I had not been here now, if there had not been a Judas
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:165991:5"/>abroad. Then one of the Keepers called him from the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide to the Window, and looked upon the Irons about his legs, to ſee whether they fitted him. <hi>Well!</hi> (ſaid Mr. <hi>Hind</hi>) <hi>all this I value no more then a three pence; I owe a debt to God, and a debt I muſt pay; bleſſed be his Name, that he hath kept me from ſhedding oſ innocent bloud, which is now a great comſort to me: And indeed, this likewlſe is a ſupportment to me, that I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the rich, and given to the poor; for nothing doth more impoveriſh the Cottage-keeper, then the rich Farmer, and full-fed Lawyer: Eut truly I could wiſh, that thing was as little uſed in</hi> England <hi>amongſt Lawyers, as the eating of Swines-fleſh was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Jews: ☞ They were the men I chiefly aimed at.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Friday</hi> laſt a Gentleman came to him, importuning him to petition the Parliament for life, and to impeach and make a diſcovery of his Aſſociates, perſwading him in ſo doing, the Parliament would be merciful to him. <hi>No, no, Sir! I defie ſuch treachery and perſidiouſneſs: no man living ſhall be by me impeached; if I die, I'le die alone; I am reſolved to keep my Conſcience cleer and untainted of that bloudy Fact, or guilt of Sin.</hi> He ſtands accuſed of High-Treaſon; and hath two men to watch every night with him: They burn candle night and day.
