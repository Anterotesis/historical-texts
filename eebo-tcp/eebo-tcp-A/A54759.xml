            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>UPon perusal of a Pamphlet written by so ingenious an Author as
Mr. <hi>L'Estrange,</hi> called, <hi>The Papist in Masquerade, in answer
to the Character of a Popish Successour,</hi> my expectation was
strangely frustrated, when I found the Book look more like a
<hi>Poor Robin</hi>'s <hi>Almanack</hi> than an <hi>Answer,</hi> the major part of
the Pamphlet being a kind of <hi>Red-letter Kalendar</hi> in two Columes, with the
<hi>Popish Worthies</hi> on one side, and the <hi>Republican</hi> ones on the other; as <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliac</hi>
on that hand and <hi>Oliver</hi> over against him; and so <hi>Mariana</hi> and <hi>Knox,
Pius Quintus</hi> and <hi>Buchanan, Guido Faux</hi> and <hi>Hugh Peters,</hi> &amp;c. I confess,
had he design'd to publish the Villanies both of a Popish and a Republican Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy,
and after a plain demonstration of the Government's being really
undermined by both those threatning Enemies, had given his Country some
light to steer in the <hi>golden Medium</hi> between both those fatal <hi>Extreams,</hi> his
Intention had been honest, and he had writ like a <hi>Patriot:</hi> But alas! that's
none of his <hi>Province;</hi> his Talent is otherwise employ'd: for the sole drift of
his Book was not in the least to expose Popery any farther than to make the
<hi>Fanatical</hi> and <hi>Jesuitical</hi> Principles <hi>agree;</hi> for take his Opinion abstracted
from that Designe, and his whole Book has no other aim but to make all our
dangers of Popery and a Popish Successour, and all the whole Plot against the
King, Religion, and Government, (to use his own Phrase, <hi>p.</hi> 69.) <hi>but a
painted Lion upon a Wall;</hi> and the Prosecutors of that Plot, and the Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers
of those Dangers, <hi>a real Bed of Vipers.</hi> In fine, the main purpose he
drives at, is to make an exact Parallel between this Age and that of 40 &amp; 41,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that he may so do, you must allow him this <hi>great Fundamental,</hi> That
all the Sticklers against Popery and a Popish Successour, are <hi>Fanaticks;</hi> and
that all Fanaticks hate both the King and Kingly Government, and are tooth
&amp; nail down-right <hi>Republicans.</hi> Vpon this Basis his whole Fabrick stands.</p>
            <p>But to rectifie his Mistake in this great point: Have not four Parliaments
successively been satisfied in the truth of a Popish Plot for the murder of the
King, and subversion of the Government, and jealous of the dangers of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
like honest Patriots muster'd all their strength to prevent it? If the Plot
were onely a Bugbear, how comes it that the Wisdom of the Nation in four
Parliaments together, has not discover'd the Cheat? or if they do know the
Cheat and act themselves the Legerdemain, and so make the prosecution of
the Plot but a Presbyterian Artifice to inflame a Kingdom, in order to playing
the game of 41 ore again, as his impious detractions would insinuate, I would
ask him, first, How comes it to pass that all the Plot-Evidence have all along
so constantly adhered to their Attestations, and that too in so <hi>beggarly</hi> and
<hi>starving</hi> a Cause, after such vast and tempting <hi>Proffers</hi> for retracting of their
Evidence; and vaster Rewards, no doubt, they might have, upon the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of such a Presbyterian Cheat, if it were one, not onely as a Ransom for
<pb facs="tcp:93323:3"/>
so many Great mens lives, but likewise from the greatest hands of the Nation
that would desire nothing more than such a Discovery? Secondly, I would
ask him how it came about that the first of these four Parliaments grew so
vehement against the Plot? they, I hope, he'll confess were a <hi>Protestant</hi> and
a <hi>Church of England</hi> Parliament; they were elected Members just after the
King's Restoration, in all the height of the Extasie of <hi>England,</hi> when Majesty
and Monarchy were the Peoples <hi>Darlings</hi> even to Idolatry, at a time when the
Horrours of the Civil Wars were fresh in their memories, when the very thought
of Presbyterian or Independent Commonwealths, with Rumpers and Rumps,
were as detestable as Hell! That Parliament, I hope, thus chosen and thus
qualified, he'll allow had no Presbyterian Gall in their Veins, and no Canker
of 41, being the very men that on the contrary made the Laws against all
Dissenters, and in all their Acts throughout maintain'd the Dignity and Glory
of the present Church of <hi>England;</hi> and yet this Parliament, as little Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian
as it was, gave the first stroke against the Plot; as I remember, 'twas
they that discovered those swarms of Papists that had infested the King's
Guards, and his Court it self, and crept into almost all Offices of Trust, and
by whom planted, I need not tell him: And as I remember, those were the
very men that created the <hi>Test,</hi> and made the Reception of the Protestant
Sacrament, and the Renunciation of the Idolatries of <hi>Rome,</hi> an Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to all Employments, on purpose to sweep out those Locusts: Nay, those
were the very men that removed our Popish Heir presumptive from his <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty,</hi>
and all other his Preferments; and no doubt had they continued
still, would have very little varied from the true and honourable <hi>English
Genius</hi> of the last: So that without shamming this inveteracy onely upon
Dissenters, there has been a Protestant People, a Protestant House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and Protestant Lords, (Protestant Lord Bishops onely excepted) that
have struggled both against Popery and a Popish Succession. So that upon
Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi>'s Argument that the present Dangers of <hi>England</hi> lie onely
in a Republican Conspiracy, and that the present state of 80 and 81, is but a
kind of transmigration of the Spirit of 41 and 42, in order to the revival
of the old Game of 48; it is not onely the Dissenters but the Protestants are
in the Confederacy; and so the whole Nation is in a Spirit of Rebellion,
(the innocent Papists onely excepted:) that is, <hi>There's a Plot lies at every
door but the right.</hi> However, the Pamphleteers of this Age will not be so
satisfied: for 'tis the great Maxime they all lay down, Every man that is
for excluding a Popish Successour is a <hi>Fanatick,</hi> and every Fanatick (as I
told you) a <hi>Republican.</hi> But to convince 'em, if they are not incorrigible,
that 'tis not onely a Fanatical Exclusion, What if I pickt out even of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
protesting Lords themselves, several of them of famous and exemplary
Loyalty, so far from the possibility either of Fanaticks or Republicans, that
they have been Caviliers and Loyalists through all our late Troubles; one or
two of them that have been Generals in the King's service; a third, whose Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
lost his head for him; a fourth, that for asserting the King's Right in
the Field, had no other Reprieve from a Gallows but his Majesties Return; a
fifth, that beside the constant sums sent over to the King in his Exile, after a
total sequestration of his Estate, pawn'd even his last Stake, his Plate, to
serve him; with several other Sufferings that many others of 'em under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went:
And yet the Scriblers of these times shall tell you there's never a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
son of them all that loves either the King or the Government, but is a
rank Fanatick; for the very thought of an Exclusion turns <hi>ipso momento</hi>
Fanaticism. So that it will be worth a mans while to give the world the
<pb facs="tcp:93323:3"/>
true definition of a Fanatick, and a full interpretation of the word. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
in old times, a Fanatick so called, signified an Enthusiastick in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
one that pretended to Inspiration and new Light, or had a picque a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a Liturgie or Surplice, or the like: But a Fanatick of 79 and 80,
is quite another thing, and the word of a quite different signification; for
now, <hi>He that values the safety of himself and his Posterity, he that thinks
he has an Estate and Liberty worth preserving, a Country worth saving, a
Religion worth defending, and indeed a God worth serving, is a FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NATICK.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But 'twill not be amiss to instance the validity of some of those Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
he makes between the present Iealousies and those of the late times. Mr.</hi>
L'Estrange, <hi>p. 21.</hi> says <hi>Earle</hi> before the Commons, <hi>Nov. 5. 1644. Saul</hi>'s
Sons are not spared, no nor may <hi>Agag</hi> or <hi>Benhadad,</hi> though themselves
Kings: <hi>Zimri</hi> and <hi>Cosbi,</hi> though Princes of the people, must be pursued
into their Tents. This is the way to consecrate your selves to God. <hi>Vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which he remarks,</hi> And what was the ground of all this Fierceness, but
a Popish King, though the glory of the Reformation, for want of a Popish
Successour?</p>
            <p>So that here lies the Analogie betwixt our Fears and theirs. Then the
groundless Fierceness lay against a pretended imaginary Popish King, though
in truth the Glory of the Reformation; and now the fierceness lies against a
real Popish Subject, that may be our King, the very Infamy of all Apostacy,
when degenerated to such principles, and yet born of such a Father. And
afterwards in the same page, he says, <hi>Mr.</hi> L'E. <hi>This is enough to convince
the world that the very sound of Popery will do the business as well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a ground as with it; and whoever goes to alarm the people upon this
desperate point, had need give good security for his Allegiance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what's all this, but to tell us, because a <hi>Bugbear</hi> frighted us once,
therefore a real <hi>Fiend</hi> must not fright us now? So that his whole Discourse
can be reduced to no other heads but these.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First.</hi> It makes the most uncharitable inferences that 'tis possible for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice
or Ill-nature to invent. Because a <hi>Judas</hi> once <hi>kiss'd</hi> and <hi>betray'd,</hi> and
a <hi>Joab embraced</hi> and <hi>stab'd,</hi> therefore no man must ever kiss or embrace
without a treacherous and murderous intention. The hatching of the old
<hi>Republican Conspiracy</hi> under the <hi>fictitious fears</hi> of approaching Popery, must
now make the <hi>just fears</hi> of the <hi>true danger</hi> of Popery equally guilty of the
same Treason and Combination.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> He cuts off the whole Right and Liberty of the Subject at one
blow. Because a knot of <hi>Achitophels</hi> once pretended Grievances where none
was, to accomplish their own wicked purposes; therefore no Subject shall or
may petition or vote, though in a <hi>legal Parliamentary way,</hi> for the redress
of the greatest Grievance in Nature, and that in the plainest and most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
Exigence of a Nation; but must be forced silently to sit down by his
hard Fate, and be debarred the priviledge of <hi>Laws,</hi> nay even of his very
<hi>Prayers</hi> for his Deliverance.</p>
            <p>Now is it not a little hard, that after the goodness of our most gracious
Soveraign that has made <hi>An Act of Oblivion,</hi> Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi>'s Vengeance
alone should be implacable, and set the Childrens teeth an edge for the sour
Grapes their Grandfathers eat so long ago, by entailing a Curse upon their
Posterity in <hi>secula seculorum?</hi> But how ridiculous and how false soever
were the fears of Popery in the last Age, how treacherous the Serpent that
lurkt under those fair but false pretences, and how fatal soever the sting that
<pb facs="tcp:93323:4"/>
attended it, yet our endeavours sure may beboth legal and honest, against the
plain and visible dangers of Popery under the threatning influence of a Popish
Heir; manifested such a one, not onely by the long and indefatigable Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations
of Hell in his behalf, the most horrid Iesuitish Confederacy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the life of a Protestant King, a Protestant Church and Government,
animated and founded on their Assurance of establishing their own infernal
Reign under the umbrage of his Scepter, a scepter design'd to be made out of
that consecrated Ponyards hilt reserved to cut a passage for him to a Throne
through the heart of a Protestant Majesty, a Scepter that both like <hi>Moses</hi> and
<hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod, at once should bud and blossom for the Glory of <hi>Rome,</hi> but
turn a devouring <hi>Snake</hi> for the Heretick Confusion and Destruction; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
such a one, I say, not onely from all this apparent Testimony, but
even by a yet stronger demonstration, those <hi>printed recorded Pacquets of
Letters</hi> which as <hi>littora scripta manet,</hi> flie in the face of all Dispute, and
stop the very mouth of Flattery, Equivocation, and Artisice, by plainly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
to all Eyes and all Vnderstandings a private Intrigue and Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
between the Heir of a Protestant Kingdom, and the Pope, the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable
Enemy both of Protestant Kings and Kingdoms; a Correspondence
too subtly disguis'd in <hi>MYSTERIES</hi> and <hi>CHARACTERS,</hi> that usual
<hi>Hocus pocus</hi>-Language where the World has so often been the Cully, whilst
Treachery play'd the Iuggler: So that to match the present <hi>Genius</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
with that of 41 and 42, as all the scribling canting Favourers of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery
would impudently sham upon the world, is to make even North and
South meet together, to unite the most opposite Contradictions in Nature, to
make a Plot and no Plot, shadows and substances, truth and falshood, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
and no dangers, Protestants and no Protestants, nay Patriots and Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
the very same thing, the designe of that Age being to reduce us to <hi>Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,</hi>
and this to free us from it.</p>
            <p>But suppose (as they say) there were some turbulent malecontented Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
in the Nation of Commonwealth principles, and that they herded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the honest and worthy Opposers of Popery, resolving to play the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and extract poyson from the same Flower from which the Bee sucks Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
Let us but consider two things, and then we shall find how impossible
'tis for them to attain their desires, and perfect so extravagant a projection.
1. The Grievance of the Nation is a Popish Successour; and that Grievance
once removed by a <hi>Bill of Exclusion,</hi> we countermine all the Arts and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties
of <hi>Rome,</hi> that have or can be form'd against us, and raise an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable
Bulwark against all our Enemies on that side, and at the same
time they will not onely supply the King with money, which is one of the
strongest Nerves of power, but also it will undoubtedly restore him the intire
Affections of all or most of the Commonalty of <hi>England</hi> which have or can
be alienated, or estranged by his unhappy and too vigorous defence of a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour
so universally odious: so that these Republican <hi>Matchivilians</hi> joyn
in the very project that destroys them; for by this means what the <hi>Monarch</hi>
wins, the <hi>Republican</hi> loses. 2. 'Tis an undeniable Truth, that the whole
Populace in general abhor such a thought, and the Miseries of the late Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Wars are too lively in their memories, for them ever to be wrought up
again into the same Frenzy.</p>
            <p>Though the deluded Multitude were then put out of love with Kings, they
found too soon by woful Experience, that the <hi>Protectorate</hi> was ten times
worse, and whatever prejudice they had conceived against the old unhappy
<hi>King,</hi> yet the grievous Oppressions, Taxes, and standing Armies under <hi>Grom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:93323:4"/>
quickly open'd their Eyes, and to their own sad cost, assured them they
had not mended but marred their condition by rebelling: And that <hi>Oliver</hi>'s
policy in deposing a <hi>King</hi> to establish a <hi>Protector,</hi> was but an old Roman
Iuggle revived; when as History tells us, after the <hi>Romans</hi> had been weary
of Kings, as a power too Arbitrary for them, they were cunningly drawn in
to a subjection to that of <hi>Imperator,</hi> which was ten times more Tyrannick
of the two, and shelter'd the Cruelties of the worst of Monsters, a <hi>Nero</hi> and
a <hi>Caligula:</hi> So that in our circumstances, 'tis almost impossible that English
men should be twice gull'd with the same Cheat, or their Swords be ever
drawn in our old unnatural Broyls; but if ever that day shall come that they
are drawn again, it must be onely then when a Popish Successour's possessing
the Throne shall represent to them a more terrible Scene of Misery than a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
War can bring: so that if ever they are inflamed into that desperation,
it must be when they shall run headlong into a less <hi>Charybis</hi> to avoid a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Scylla.</hi> But whether one be greater or less than t'other, or they but think
it so, yet this is most certain, Popery and Rebellion are both those dangerous
Gulphs that will either of them swallow up the peace of <hi>England.</hi> And as
'tis unanswerably true, that the glory of God, the defence of our Lives and
Liberties, and the support of our present Monarchy of <hi>England,</hi> are onely
to be upheld by a Protestant Interest, and that Interest is never to be effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
secured but by a Popish Exclusion: So that Exclusion likewise at the
same time puts an end to all our dangers on the other side, <hi>viz.</hi> to all thoughts
or possibility of a Rebellion.</p>
            <p>But to give a truer account of the present State of <hi>England</hi> than Mr.
<hi>L'Estrange</hi> has done in affinity to 41, I will confess this present Age has
derived one thing from 41 and 42, and that is a <hi>Curse</hi> they left behind 'em,
the Curse of the Shepherds Boy in the Fable; our crying out so often former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<hi>Help, Master, help, the Wolf's in the Shepfold,</hi> when he was not there,
has made us disbelieved at last now he is there; and like him too, be left
most helpless when we most want it.</p>

            <head>THE
CHARACTER
OF A
Popish Successour
COMPLEAT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE first Allegation Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> makes against the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterizer's
Reasonings is, That his Master-piece is a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox,
by the supposal of a most excellent person, and yet
making him the greater Devil for his Vertues; and so he
sums up the Characterizer's opinion in short thus:</p>
            <p>Ch. <hi>His Fortitude</hi> (says he) <hi>makes him the more daring in
the Cause of</hi> Rome; <hi>his Iustice makes it a point of Conscience to deliver
us up to the Pope; his Temperance in the government of his Passions, makes
him more close and steady; and his Prudence crowns the work by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance
it gives him in the management of his Policies and Conduct;</hi> and
so he goes on. What boots it in a Popish Heir to say, he's the truest
Friend, the greatest of Hero's, the best of Masters, the justest Judge, and
the honestest of Men? All meer treacherous Quick-sands for a People to
repose the least glimps of Safety in, or build the least Hopes upon.</p>
            <p>Thus much the Character. To which he answers,</p>
            <p>This is fairly push'd, I must consess; but 'tis onely a Cast of his Rhetorick:
for every body knows that all Christian Princes thus qualified, and under
Articles of Treaty and Agreement, keep touch even with Infidels, nay, and
Infidels with Christians.</p>
            <p>This is all he has in his whole Pamphlet in answer to this part of the
Character: for he thinks he has made the Characterizer's whole Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
so plain a contradiction in its self, that he needs no other Brand than
his own words, to stigmatize him; and the very repetition of a Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
so monstrous, is its own confutation.</p>
            <p>But this on our Answerers part is not so fairly push'd: for thus far here's
neither Rhetorick nor Reason. For what Relation can Christian Princes
keeping touch with Infidels, and Infidels with Christians, upon Articles
of Treaty and Agreement, have to a Popish Successour's Tyranny and
Injustice over his own Subjects? Does it follow, Because the French
King upon Articles of Treaty and Agreement, has kept touch with the
<hi>Swede,</hi> though the most inveterate Enemy of the Popish Religion perhaps
of any Protestant Prince in <hi>Christendom,</hi> and consequently the most oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
to his own perswasion, that therefore he has not overleap'd all the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93323:6"/>
due and lawful bounds of the French Government, and tyrannically en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaved
his People; nay, contrary to the solemn Covenant at <hi>Nants</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> most inhumanely persecuted the poor Protestants?
What if a Christian Prince keeps his Articles with Turks or Infidels, nay
Villains and Robbers, the Pyrates of <hi>Argiers</hi> or <hi>Sally?</hi> Nay, what if Q.
<hi>Mary</hi> her self had done as much, must it therefore follow that she would
not break her Vows and Protestations with the <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi>-inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
and burn the very men that mounted her into her Throne, when
animated by the Withcrafts of <hi>Rome?</hi> But that the Fidelity betwixt
Prince and Prince may more plainly appear to hold no proportion or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity
with that betwixt Prince and People; or foreign Articles either for
the enlargement or security of Empire, the promotion of Trade, or any
other State-interest, with a Church-government or Church-persecution at
home, we shall give this undeniable Reason.</p>
            <p>A King for breach of Faith with his People, esteems himself onely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
to God; but for breach of Faith with Foreign Princes, either
Christian or Infidels, he is accountable to Man, and may draw down a just
War upon his head for such a Violation; nay, perhaps wholly dispossess
himself of the hopes of Foreign Assistance for the future in his greatest
dangers and exigences, occasion'd by the stain such Infidelity may lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, when his more venial breach of Vows at home, shall be no blot
in his Scutcheon. And whereas here he's onely answerable to God, what
if his Priests, as in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Case, impose so far upon his blinded
Zeal till they make him believe that the performance of Protestations in
cases derogatory to the glory of Heaven, and against the propagation of
Christianity, shall be more answerable to God than the breaking of them?</p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> resolves to play the State-Sophister, and gives us
this tryal of his strength in his very first page, to let us know how great a
Casuist and how potent an Antagonist we must expect to find him.</p>
            <p>But here the other Answerer is a little more prolix upon this subject, and
tells the Characterizer, <hi>That in a Roman Catholick he makes Virtues them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
turn Vices, and equals if not outgoes Transubstantiation it self.</hi>
And to justifie the four Cardinal Virtues from the Characterizer's making
them an Instrument of our Destruction, he assignes 'em a quite contrary
operation in a Popish Successour than that in the Character, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If he has Fortitude, which is a Vertue equally distant from Temerity and
Rashness, as from Fear and Cowardize, it will with-hold him from attem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting
things impossible; as setting up Arbitrary Power, or introducing Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.
If he be a man of Iustice, that should give us the greater assurance
that his Courage shall be no otherwise exercised than for our Safety and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
to whom all his endeavours by all the Laws both Humane and Divine
are due, and to which he shall be by Oath obliged. <hi>But here by the way,
I could have wish'd our Author had left out the word</hi> [Divine;] <hi>for
those hearty endeavours the Divine Laws of a Popish Successour will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
him to exercise for the Safety and Honour of a Heretick Nation and
Heretick Religion, we are better inform'd of. But to proceed,</hi> If he's a
Master of Temperance, what is that but a Bridle upon all his Excesses, a
perpetual Bosom-Monitor that will with-hold his Arm and allay his Heat,
and curb all the motions of Cruelty and Revenge? And lastly, if he has
Prudence, that will teach him not to exasperate a People of so stiff a Neck,
nor lose the hearts of his Subjects for their difference of opinion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
peradventure endanger the loss of his Crown, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:93323:6"/>
Now this Author I confess has push'd a little fairer than t'other; for he
has given us an Argument that looks like Sence, though it be none: for
what's all this to the conduct of an inflexible Papist? The Characterizer
tells us, that in a Bigotted Prince, his Morals shall be Slaves to his Zeal;
and accordingly instances how far they shall be instrumental to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
subversion and destruction: But here the Answerer artfully leaves
out the main point, and tells us what a <hi>meer moral</hi> man would do, in case
of succeeding to the Crown of <hi>England.</hi> He mounts the poor Postilion
into the Saddle, and tells us how his meer Morality would drive; but
takes no notice of that Lordly Charioteer, Religion, that holds the Reins
above him, whose nod he obeys, and at whose absolute command he turns
either to the right or the left. So that as this Answerer has stated the
case, I am thus far of his mind, That had we an Heir apparent of no more
Religion than a <hi>Iulian</hi> or a <hi>Nero,</hi> and yet at the same time were compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Master of the moral Virtues, possibly he might steer as he proposes:
but let him recollect himself, and put Popery and Morals together, and
then he'll find his mistake. For my part, I am asham'd that any men that
pretend to write Sence, should endeavour to perswade us that a Popish
Bigot, and a man of courage and wisdom in a Successour, should not go
farther towards the establishing of Popery, than a Coward and a Fool;
so that not onely his Morals, but every other natural Gift or Perfection,
shall be particularly assistant to the Ruine both of Protestant Religion and
Liberty. But because Example is more powerful than Precept, I'll give
you a taste of the Popish Morals in a very remarkable Story.</p>
            <p>Soon after the selling of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> from which time the poor Protestants
in <hi>France</hi> date the <hi>AEra</hi> of their Calamities, it being about that time that
the French King began to disturb their Peace, infringe their Liberties, and
demolish their Churches, contrary to all the sacred Bonds of the solemn
Engagement at <hi>Nants;</hi> the distress'd <hi>Hugonots</hi> groaning beneath a greater
load of Misery than any of the rest of the French Subjects, their fellow-slaves,
under the persecution of his new <hi>Ashtaroth</hi> Arbitrary power, thought
fit privately to implore the intercession of a powerful Neighbour, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant
Monarch, to mediate in their behalf in mitigation of the French
King's unchristian-like severity; and accordingly chose a very honest and
wise man, by name <hi>Rohux,</hi> an Inhabitant of <hi>Nisme</hi> in <hi>Languedock,</hi> for this
secret Embassie, as being a person formerly very fortunate in <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
on the like occasion, having obtain'd a lucky Favour from <hi>Cromwel</hi>
in reconciliation of a difference betwixt the French Protestants and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Mazarine.</hi> This <hi>Rohux</hi> thus commission'd, the approach to Majesty
being difficult, to make his Access more easie, applies himself first to a
visibly Protestant Heir apparent, hoping to strengthen the power of his
own Supplications by the introduction and countenance of so great and
so princely an Advocate. This Royal Heir or Masquerader, or by what
other Title disguis'd or distinguish'd, with a seeming-cordial Friendship
embraces the poor <hi>Hugonots</hi> Cause, and day after day receives his Address
with many solemn but airy promises of speedy Assistance; but in the
mean time, disgusted and gall'd to the Soul at so audacious and impious a
Petition as the Protestant preservation, and abhorring so detestable an
Employment, nay, the very name of the Hereticks Defender, instead of
his promis'd Aid, he on the contrary most cunningly laid the Platform of
a Revenge as exquisite as so heinous a Petition deserv'd. Immediately he
goes to the French Embassadour, and tells him how one of the French
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93323:7"/>
Subjects had very arrogantly and scandalously calumniated his great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
with obprobrious names of Tyranny, Oppression, and breach of Faith;
into which very Language he himself before had exasperated him, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to make his Ruine secure, which the bare accusation of a Suit in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of his Religion, would not alone have effected. The Embassadour,
as bound in duty, for the vindication of his King's Honour, desires a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
testimony of the Offence and Offender: Which the Royal Informer
effectually gives him, by appointing another Conference with <hi>Rohux;</hi>
where privately he plants this Kingly Representative as an Honourable
Evesdropper, to over-hear a Repetition of the whole Discourse, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
his Belief from his own Ears.</p>
            <p>Now some people would start an Objection, and say, That this humble
Office and low-spirited Snare against the life of a poor wretch, might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
from the Glory of two such Illustrious Personages; the one for the
greatness of his Employment, and the other the greatness of his Birth.
But to remove their mistake, I assure 'em there is not that Deed so abject,
when acted for the Cause of <hi>Rome,</hi> that cannot be transform'd into Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and Heroick, by the stupendious power of that infallible Church, where
even Daggers and Ponyards admit of Consecration.</p>
            <p>But to return to our History. This Conference contrived and managed
as heart could with, the Embassadour posts over this <hi>Rohux</hi> Treachery to
<hi>France,</hi> whilst he, poor unsuspecting Innocence, continues his dayly Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to his Great Advocate. But finding in time so many delatory De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs,
he luckily at last discovers he is betray'd: Upon which, dreading
the Vengeance of the French King, not daring to return to <hi>France,</hi> he
steals away into <hi>Switzerland</hi> for his protection; but the French King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
advertised of his Motions, gets him trepan'd by an Ambsuscade in the
night, and being by surprize forced out from thence into <hi>France,</hi> he is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
upon the Wheel.</p>
            <p>Now who so blind as cannot but plainly see that each particular Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Virtue in this Illustrious Heroe, were most signally exercised in this
Triumphant Encounter? First, here was Courage even to admiration;
he play'd the Romish Champion young, and early flush'd himself in He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick
Bloud, whilst like a second <hi>Alcides,</hi> who strangled Snakes even in his
Cradle, he most victoriously tore up that Heart by the roots whose Tongue
durst but hiss against the Papal Dignity, as the first bold Prologue of his
more undaunted Atchievements, and more dazling Glories yet to come.</p>
            <p>Then here was <hi>Iustice</hi> to the height; an impudent French Villain as he
was, to cross the Seas on so infamous a Commission as the Rebuilding of
the <hi>Hugonot</hi>-Temples, those Altars of <hi>Baal,</hi> which the God-like hand of
<hi>France</hi> had so justly laid in Ruine? an Impiety so hainous as forfeited
both Life and Soul, and deserved the severest Rods and Axes of Justice:
He deserv'd 'em, and he had 'em.</p>
            <p>Then here was <hi>Temperance</hi> even to astonishment; here was no laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
into Passion, no Thunder in his Tongue, nor Basilisks in his Eyes,
at the surprize of so execrable a Petition as the imploring his Intercession
for the loath'd Hereticks Deliverance: Alas, no, his Temperance, like a
Bosom-Monster (as our Author has it) bridled all those Excesses, and
treated this notorious Suppliant with those hearty professions of kindness,
and promis'd services, till he betray'd his bones to the Wheel, with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
and Aspect so moderate and so serene, as the old <hi>Romans</hi> lead their
Victims with Flowers and Garlands to their Execution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:93323:7"/>
Then here was <hi>Prudence</hi> beyond example; first, in inflaming the poor
French-man into declamations and detractions against the Majesty of
<hi>France,</hi> thereby to manage his Tragedy more artfully, by making him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Blow from the hands of the Temporal not Ecclesiastical Justice,
as dying more for a Traytor than a Heretick: for though, 'tis true, the last
was Crime sufficient, yet lest the ill-judging world might mistake, and
not think so, he was wisely noosed into one Crime, to pull down the
Vengeance due to the other. But what's the greatest Prudence of all
yet, this politick Heroe all this while was a visible Member of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
Church, knelt at our Altars, joyn'd in our Prayers, and shared in our
Sacrament and Communion.</p>
            <p>But one thing I had almost forgotten; the unknown Answerer, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
us for the more firm security that a Popish Successour's Cardinal Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
shall keep that Honourable and indeed Innocent Path that he has
traced out for him, he makes a very long Harangue in praise of his adored
<hi>Mecoenas.</hi> First, for his Courage, <hi>That his Royal Bloud (as often as his
King or Countries Honour or Safety called upon him) was ever as dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously
and as freely exposed, as that which fills the veins of the vilest Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beian,</hi>
&amp;c, And why not? since it is no such wondrous Novelty for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
crown'd heads themselves personally to fight their own Battels: I
cannot think it any great condescention in a Prince (at that time not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
so visible an Heir apparent) to accept of the Admiralty of an
English Navy; an Employment, where the Glory of it does more than
reward the Hazard. So that as I take it, his own Honour as well as his
Countries, call'd upon him.</p>
            <p>After this, he passes to another branch of Princely Endowments, <hi>viz.
That his Friendships have ever been as firmly maintain'd, as they were ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciously
chosen: That his Mouth and his Heart have always been so true
to one another, that his Word has been as inviolate as the Oaths of others:
And this noble Constancy has not been the effect so much of his Honour as
his Conscience,</hi> &amp;c. Without all doubt: Yet I have heard a very odde
Story of one Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> that tipt over the pearch about a year or two
ago. I fancy I could draw a Picture with this Label in his mouth, <hi>There
is no Faith in Man,</hi> so like him, you'd scarce know one from t'other:
Nay, poor <hi>Iack Catch</hi> shall cry out shame of all such usage. There was
not that poorest Rogue of all the Plot-Martyrs, that had not two or three
Guinneys at least at his service, to bribe him to use a gentle hand with them
and hang 'em out of pain, before he made minced Meat of them. But
<hi>Coleman</hi> was so trepan'd into <hi>Pluto</hi>'s Court, came so unprepared for the
<hi>Elysian</hi>-shades, that he that had been Master of the Purses both of the
French and English Monsieurs too, when he came to cross the <hi>Stygian</hi>
Lake, had not so much as one poor Obelus to pay his Ferriman's Fare.
<hi>Durum est post omnia perdere naulum.</hi> And methinks this was a little
unkindly done; yet upon second thoughts, possibly it might be contrived
for his good. Flesh and Bloud is frail, and who knows but he might have
had humane thoughts about him, and so have fallen from the holy Cause;
which careful Mother Church, for the salvation of his Soul, in her pious
and Christian wisdom, thought fit to prevent, by making a Saint of him
without his knowledge: And alas, he was shrewdly hurt, was he not?
to be tript up into Heaven, and cheated into Immortality.</p>
            <p>But here I cannot omit one remarkable Observation of Mr. <hi>L'Estrange's,
pag.</hi> 38. speaking of this Princes former services to his Country; where
he says,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:93323:8"/>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> L'E. I find some people of opinion, that this King in Reversion, is of
the same Perswasion at this day, that he was when he acquired all those
Glories.</p>
            <p>Now if there be such a sort of people, and so strong a Faith in the
world, I would willingly be instructed what They, or Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> for
them, mean by <hi>Perswasion.</hi> If the Popish perswasion, then they justifie
the severest Reflections in the whole Character, and lay that unprincely
and unchristian Disguise at his door of kneeling at our Altars, and partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating
of our Sacraments with all the meanest and basest Hypocrisie ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable;
little less than dipping in the Dish, and drinking of the Cup, and
kissing where he betray'd. But if they mean the Protestant perswasion,
of which Communion he then visibly was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they will be but so kind as
to prove him a Protestant still, I assure them the Author shall burn his
Character, and make a publick Recantation for his Mistake; but at the
same time they must give him leave to write another tentimes bitterer than
the first: For he that can suppose a Prince really and truly a Protestant,
that shall for so many years together withdraw from his own Communion,
and that too not onely so manifestly against his Interest, but against the
very Dictates of his Conscience, the Duty of his Religion, and the Glory
of his God; thereby to exasperate and embroil a whole Nation in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions,
to inflame and widen all our Divisions, and in short, to put
out both his own Eyes to put out one of his Brothers; and all this for
just nothing, except a meer Humour, a letchery of doing Mischief for no
other end or purpose but meer Mischiefs sake, is a character of that unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd
Ingratitude, and indeed all that's ill together, that I hope Earth
nere bore, nor Hell ere punisht: for I should be sorry to think it possible
there could be such a Creature in nature; neither am I a little sorry to
think there is a people in the world that can fancy there is such a one. I
confess, the withdrawing from our Communion upon the change of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
may admit of some Apology; and our ill circumstances under that
Change, are not altogether so wonderful.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now after this Answerer has sum'd up all his matchless Virtues, he tells
you in short,</hi> How improbable a thing it would be, how contradictory to
Reason and common Sence, that the difference of a mans opinion about
some few disputable matters of Faith, and not very material Ceremonies
of Divine Worship, should on a sudden efface all those good Characters of
Magnanimity and Iustice, Generosity and Goodness, not slightly traced,
but deeply engraved in his Breast.</p>
            <p>Here the Reader may observe what a good Protestant the Author is,
and how prettily he states the little disparity betwixt the Protestant and
Popish Faith, differing onely in some few disputable matters of Faith,
and not very material Ceremonies of Divine Worship. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:
The Deifying of Wafers, the Idolizing of Images, the Invocation
of Saints, and making the Milk of a <hi>Mary</hi> almost of as great vertue as the
Bloud of a <hi>Iesus;</hi> with twenty other Trifles and inconsiderable Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.
For my part, I would not be he that at <hi>Cadice</hi> or <hi>Salamanca</hi>
should make no more difference betwixt the Divine Worship of Holy
Church and that of Heretick Dogs, for fear the Lords of the Inquisition
should make some material Ceremony with me, and treat me with a
Cauldron of scalding Oyl for my Entertainment. But perhaps our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerer
durst say twice as much, if he were there; for no doubt but they
know him so well, that they'd pardon his Railery, and take it for but a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93323:8"/>
copy of his Countenance. But whatever our Author's Religion is, his
Memory is none of the best; for within three leaves after this, he quite
forgets himself, and unluckily compares the difference between the two
Religions <hi>in haec Verba.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Idolatrous Superstition has been so long worn off the minds of the
People, and the Reformation so deeply and so strongly rooted in the Reigns
of four most religious and prudent Princes; the Church of <hi>England</hi> so
firmly establisht, and that as much by the purity of its Doctrine, the decency
of its Discipline, and the innocency of its Principles, as by the Authority
of the Publick and the Laws of the Land. The Romish Church so detested
both for the dangerous Innovations of its Doctrine, and the Idolatry of
its Ceremonies; and so odious in the eyes of the People for its pernicious
Principles express'd in the villanous practices of its Professors in Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres
and Plots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our Answerer's Ingenuity can answer all this, and tell you, What
though their Ceremonies are so idolatrous, their Innovations so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
their Principles so pernicious, their Plots so odious, their Massacres
so barbarous, and their Professors so villanous? yet a Popish Heir presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive
professing the same Superstition, shall be a Lamb, a Dove, a Saint
amongst us upon occasion, and that too for his Reasons above-said: For
as he told you before, he is a person of Royal Bloud, loves his Friend, is
a man of Courage, and a Prince, and has been an Admiral. A thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Demonstration of a peaceable Popish Innocence! Three more such
unconfutable Arguments are enough to convert the Turk, and bring in
the Jews.</p>
            <p>But now from these infallible Morals in our Heir presumptive, the
great Bulwark against all our Fears, this unknown Author concludes
both our Protestant Religion and Laws secure under him; that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Constitution of Government, and the present Church of <hi>England,</hi>
must and shall, in spite of Fate, continue unshaken. <hi>If the Popish Priests
are such Incendiaries</hi> (says he) <hi>and our most potent Enemies, have we
not Laws against them? and then why are we in such fear? What is
left to any Monarch that succeeds, but to execute the Laws be finds derived
down to him to maintain and preserve together with his Crown and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?</hi>
And though the Characterizer seems to be in so much dread of
those swarms of Roman Emissaries that will infest us under the conni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
and indulgence of a Popish Successour, he tells you he is quite
mistaken; <hi>The Reign of a Popish King will be so far from advantageous,
that it will be rather destructive to all those Iesuitical Instruments; and
that it shall be so, 'tis in the power of every Subject in the three Kingdoms
to be a defender of the Protestant Religion, if it want it; there being no
Information, no Conviction of Recusants, no Administration of Tests or
Oaths, that shall be wanting, and no diligence that shall be spared, backt
by the Laws of the Land, which then more than ever will be wakened against
them, which can't be dispenc'd withal, but must be effectual to the utter ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
of the whole Party.</hi> Miracles and Prodiges! And that there shall be
nothing wanting on the Kings part to do all this, this worthy Author is
pleased to be his Guarrantee, assuring us in his Name, that he will take
care to let the Laws have their due course; <hi>And whatever his private
Opinion may be, whatever tenderness he may bear to the persons be shall
punish, yet he shall remember his Obligation to the publick, so far as to
give 'em up to the hands of Iustice with the same constancy of mind, with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93323:9"/>
the same applauses of present and commendation of all succeeding Ages,
that the immortal</hi> Brutus <hi>delivered up his darling Sons to the Rods and
Axes of the Lictours,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I, here's a stupendious Character of a Popish Successour indeed! What
<hi>Iö Paeans</hi> might <hi>England</hi> sing, if <hi>Rome</hi>'s long hope, their Churches Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
and Restorer, their hopeful <hi>Hercules,</hi> would build his <hi>Columnes</hi> and
write his <hi>Nil plus ultra</hi> here! But alas, we are deceived, his Labours are
to come; there's a pestilent contagious Northern Heresie to be rooted
out; that many headed Beast of Errors and Schisms, that like <hi>Cerberus</hi> and
<hi>Hydra,</hi> are to be subdued, whilst in the defence of Religion and the
Cause of God, he's to play a second <hi>Atlas,</hi> and even the weight of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
is to lie on his shoulders. But our Oratorical Scribler has promis'd
Wonders in a Popish Successours Name, and elegantly pickt out a most
excellent <hi>Brutus</hi> for his Comparison. I remember there was another Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of that Name, though not of that Nature, whose Story is equally as
famous and as pertinent to the matter in hand. A <hi>Brutus</hi> the Head and
Leader of a Conspiracy against the life of the great <hi>Caesar;</hi> a <hi>Brutus</hi> that
joyn'd his heart and hand with the Murderers, and blended his Dagger
in the Assassination amongst the thirty mortal wounds that stab'd the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
of the World; a <hi>Brutus</hi> to whom the dying Monarch with an Asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
more surprizing than the death he received, in his last gasp could
say, <hi>Et tu Brute?</hi> Is my Son, my Friend, my Darling, my Delight, the
man I have rais'd, loved, honour'd, cherisht and defended, is <hi>Brutus</hi> a
Traytor?</p>
            <p>But to bring our Author to his right wits again, and to shew him how
unlikely 'tis that the English Rods or Axes shall ever hurt a Son of <hi>Rome</hi>
under a Romish Successour. If the Popish or Jesuitish party have found
such Mercy under the Reigns of Protestant Kings, but shall now on the
contrary stand the inevitable shock of Statutes, Jayls, and Gibbets, under
a Popish King, the Jesuits have plotted fairly. If the Pope and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave
have no deeper politicks than this comes to, the very Geese that
kept thir <hi>Capitol</hi> before them, had more Brains than they. If this were the
effect of their hopeful Royal Heirs Conversion, Heaven help 'em, for Hell
has forsaken 'em.</p>
            <p>No, Mr. Littleplot, once in thy life thou art mistaken; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
thee that the Protestant Laws will not, nay shall not be so hard-hearted
under his Reign, nor his St. <hi>Omers</hi> Friends treated so coursly as
thou imaginest, they have had a little taste of their kinder Entertainment
before hand. For Example: Were there a Country where Commissions
of Peace, day after day, and time out of mind, have been taken away for
daring but to lift a hand against a Son of <hi>Rome;</hi> nay, at the same time
when all other Recusants have been prosecuted, and that with encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and reward; and all by a Royal Heir's protection and interest.
Would not any Reader reply, Will he that has been their Guardian-Angel
whilst but their fellow-Subject, suffer a hair of their heads to perish when
he's their King?</p>
            <p>But yet our new Sir <hi>Positive</hi> will defend our Protestant Laws even in
despight of Fate, and tell you, That Justice shall guide her hand so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially,
and poise her scales so evenly, as shall be to the admiration of
present and succeeding Ages. Now I fancy I have heard a Tryal, where
a Criminal of Quality convicted of no less a Crime than the subornation
and stifling of Evidence, and in no less a Case than where the life of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93323:9"/>
King, and the subversion both of Religion and Government were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd,
has been mulkt in the inconsiderable sum of a hundred pound,
payable perhaps at latter <hi>Lammas;</hi> a meer trifle, and scarce more than a
<hi>Peter</hi>-peny for an Absolution: Whilst in the other extream there has been
a poor Fellow condemn'd to the Pillory, Imprisonment, and five hundred
pound fine, ten times more than he was worth in the world, for publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a scandalous reflecting line in a Pamphlet; much less offensive in
my simple opinion, than a Dagger to kill Kings and subvert States.
And pray, where will our Protestant Laws be? and what even Ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
is Justice like to have under the full-grown Scepter of a Popish Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour,
if his influence is so potent in his Minority? No, a <hi>Rhadamanth</hi>
for an <hi>Astraea</hi> must be the best of our expectations at that black day. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,
the See of <hi>Rome</hi> is like the old Lake of <hi>Sodom,</hi> the lightest Feather
that offends it, sinks in it; but to its darling Catholick Champions, 'tis
a Lake of liquid Gold, where, incircled round in Wealth, Glory, and
Preferments, the heaviest massiest bars of Iron, Swords, Daggers, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,
float on the glittering surface of Honour, and swim securely. Nay,
I would ask any reasonable man, That if the Jesuits hellish Machination
against the Kings life had taken effect, whether 'tis likely that they feared
smarting for't either in this world or the next, as dreading a Vengeance
temporal or eternal? No doubt but they had fairer hopes than so; for
had their execrable Blow succeeded, the blood of Majesty might in all
probability have found the same inquisition as the firing of <hi>London:</hi> Or
if at worst the world would not have been so satisfied, were not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natick
shoulders broad enough to bear both the guilt and the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Alas, 'twas but at worst reviving an old experienced shift, a
known <hi>pia Fraus</hi> for a Recovery. Has not the Gunpowder-Treason
(poor innocent Papists!) been a thousand times affirm'd a Plot of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils?</hi>
Has not our late designe against both King, Religion, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in contradiction of the unanimous Voice of the whole Nation in
Parliament, been confidently retorted upon the Presbyterians; and that
too without the least proof or shadow for't? And then how easily might
the Papal policy have made a Popish Murder a Fanatick Stab? and so by
the borrow'd face of Innocence, have most triumphantly play'd the second
part of <hi>Amboyna,</hi> and have sheath'd the false Sword in the false Murderers
heart, whilst the true Dagger had been consecrated, and the real Traytor
canoniz'd. Thus wisely did the prudent <hi>Nero</hi> lay his burning of <hi>Rome</hi>
at the poor innocent Christians doors, and then with all the most exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site
studied Cruelties, made the Christian bones rue for what the Infidels
hand had perpetrated.</p>
            <p>But to return to our Author, I will refer him to some modern Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
more applicable to our purpose than the History of his immortal
<hi>Brutus.</hi> Have we not lately perus'd whole scrowls of Letters from our
Saint Secretary <hi>Coleman</hi> to French Confessours, French Ministers, and
all for French Interest; and as many <hi>Rome</hi>-wards bound to Jesuits, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals,
and Pope himself, fraught with golden Mountains, and promis'd
Miracles to be acted by the Royal—for <hi>Rome</hi>'s Glory, Catholick Cause,
and Mother Church: And will any person of common sense believe that
our trusty and well-beloved Secretary promis'd more in the name of <hi>Al.</hi>
than <hi>Al.</hi> would perform. And were all those sums of money to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>England</hi> to be laid out onely in Rosaries, Beades,
and Crucifixes. Believe it who can; for for my part I am an Infidel. Alas
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93323:10"/>
no, our hopeful English Son of <hi>Mars,</hi> that modern <hi>Achilles,</hi> without
whose Arm our Protestant <hi>Troy</hi> could never fall, was no doubt to have
been brought over to <hi>Rome</hi>'s Holy War, as once the old <hi>Achilles</hi> to the
<hi>Grecian.</hi> The subtle <hi>France,</hi> like the cunning <hi>Vlysses,</hi> plays not the
Pedler with such small Wares, such effeminate Toys and Trifles; but wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hides a sparkling Sword amongst those guil'ded Bawbles, a Sword, a
Temptation fit for a valiant Masquerader; an Instrument worthy <hi>Rome</hi>'s
Hero.</p>
            <p>Besides, have we no Records but <hi>Coleman</hi>'s? Have we not had whole
Pacquets from <hi>Al. Al. Al.</hi> to that Priest, this Jesuit, and t'other Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal;
but more especially with Commendations to his Holiness, his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored
Holiness; and all wisely and artificially coucht in <hi>CHARACTERS?</hi>
And can any man, with half the brains of a Woodcock, believe that they
were all but so many <hi>How do ye's;</hi> or some idle Compliment onely to
beg a Chip of the Cross, or a Rag of the Virgins Petticoat?</p>
            <p>If the designes of <hi>Al.</hi> were honourable, why an Intrigue betwixt the
Heir of a Protestant Kingdom, and the profest and greatest Enemy of our
Religion and Liberties? Or if that Commerce between 'em could by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
extorted supposition, or upon any pretence whatever, be imagined to
be innocent, why was the whole Correspondence disguised in <hi>RIDDLES</hi>
and in <hi>CHARACTERS?</hi> Why in such mystick Cloathing, those fraudulent
Missives of Hell, and the usual notorious Masks of Villanies, Treasons, and
Conspiracies.</p>
            <p>Now from this Testimony, I would ask if it be reasonable to suppose
that the Protestant Religion and Liberty, and the Laws of that wilde
Boar <hi>Harry</hi> the Eighth, and his Daughter <hi>Bess</hi> that She-devil, will be
defended by a Popish Successour, when in defending of them he must
rob both the Church and God himself of their Right; and as much as in
him lies, strike his Dagger into the sacred Gates of <hi>Rome,</hi> and dart a Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velin
at the very heart of Christs own Vicar, and Gods undeniable Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentative;
and at the same minute be obliged to dayly Outrages, nay
Butcheries too upon the very persons of Gods Elect, the Pillars of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and the very Successours of the Apostles themselves? A pretty
kind of Law, that shall oblige him to commit at once both <hi>Murder</hi> and
<hi>Sacriledge;</hi> and all this, forsooth, in defence of a Religion, as they'll
swear for't, sprung from <hi>Harry</hi> the Eighth's Codpiece, maintain'd and
preacht onely by a pack of Reprobate Rascals, a Bastard-sort of Priests
ordain'd by the by at the Nagshead-Tavern.—I, but there lies his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Coronation Oath in the way to a Crown, that shall oblige
him to do all this. And so if there lay a knot of Thieves in a mans way
home, that should compel him to engage and promise 'em to meet 'em such
a day with a good Horse under him, and a good pair of Pistols before him,
to take the Rode with them, and rob and murder in their company. A
pretty piece of Honour that, and a strange point of Conscience, that shall
tye him to keep his word with them!</p>
            <p>Let us but rightly consider; is it to be conceived that the Pope with
all his wisdom and politicks, will ever be guilty of so much Ill-husbandry
as to make no better Emprovement of such a pretty spot of Ground as
<hi>England,</hi> when he has once retrieved it again into his own Hucksters
hands, a Popish Successours possession, as to let it lie waste still, because
it has lain so for so many Ages last past, with scarce any thing more upon
it than a parcel of rank Weeds and Thistles that have been running up
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93323:10"/>
to Seed for above a hundred years together? Perswade him to it, if you
can.</p>
            <p>I will onely refer my Reader, for his diversion, but to one short passage
in the above-named printed Pacquets of Letters, where his transported
Holiness, at the receipt of a comfortable line or two from a very good
Hand, and as 'tis to be imagined, a true and trusty Friend, is said to have
<hi>Wept for Ioy.</hi> Now I would seriously ask my Reader, if he believes
those precious Tears, that sanctified Brine, that, like <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Ointment,
trickled down the Beard of the Reverend Sire, dropt at the hearing of no
better News, and at the prospect of no fairer hopes than this. My life for
yours, there was no such meaning in it. No; for once I'll give you a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>KEY</hi> for those <hi>CHARACTERS:</hi> Our Protestant Sun, 'twas hoped, was
near setting when that Dew fell.</p>
            <p>From this we come to the power of a Coronation-Oath with a Popish
Successour; and there our Answerers are extraordinary vehement against
the Character for averring, That if the Popish Religion will absolve Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
from their Allegiance to an Heretical King, why may it not release a
King from his Faith to an Heretical excommunicated People. Upon
which, Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> remarks,</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>L'E. Take it for granted, there's no trusting to the Oath of a Roman
Catholick Prince, and ye cut the very Ligaments of Society and Commerce.
There's an end of all Treaties and Alliances, amicable and mutual Offices
betwixt Christian Princes and States. Nay, in one word, erect but this
Maxime, you turn</hi> Europe <hi>into a Shambles, and put</hi> Christendom <hi>without
any more ado into a state of War,</hi> &amp;c. Though by the way, all this makes
nothing to his purpose: for Treaties, Alliances, and Commerce betwixt
Christian Princes and States, have no Affinity with a Princes keeping
Faith with his People upon the account of Religion; as had been proved
before.</p>
            <p>But from this he goes on, and says,</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>L'E. I am not ignorant yet, either of the Doctrine, or of the practice of
several profligate wretches of the Roman Communion, in this impious par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular:
But they are such then that are wholly lost in Brutality and Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and I neither do nor can believe all Papists to be equally susceptible
of that unchristian Impression. It is a Position that may be made use of
at a dead lift to serve a political turn: And the Trick will not pass nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but upon some enthusiastick sick-headed Zealot, that takes all his
Dreams for Visions, and the vapours of his Distempers for Revelations.</hi>
Now in my apprehension, never did any man so forget himself as Mr.
<hi>L'Estrange</hi> has done here: He believes here, that that unchristian Impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
as the Allowance of Perjury, is onely the Tenet of some profligate
wretches wholly lost in Brutality and Blindness. But at the latter end of
his Book, <hi>pag. 83.</hi> he down-right contradicts that belief, and says,</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>L'E. Pope</hi> Pius Quintus <hi>absolved the Subjects of Queen</hi> Elizabeth
<hi>from all their Oaths of Allegiance to her for ever.</hi> So that now belike it
was not onely the Maxime of the above-said profligate wretches, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of the Great Successour of <hi>Peter,</hi> and the Voice of Infallibility it self;
and that too not the product of Blindness and Brutality upon Dreams
and Vapours, but the deliberate Act and Decree of the Imperial See
of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could make several other instances in this kind, as the Popes absolving
the Subjects from their Allegiance to <hi>K. Iohn,</hi> &amp;c. but 'tis the common
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93323:11"/>
Theme of all Pens, and so much the known practice and principle of
their Popes through all Ages, that I shall not think it worth my while.
Besides, Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> forgets himself a little further in this point, and
says in the same 83 page, <hi>That the Romish Iesuit holds that Dominion is
founded in Grace, and upon that principle deposes Protestant Princes,</hi> &amp;c.
Then adds, <hi>That the Pope may deprive a King of his Royal Dignity for
Heresie, Schism,</hi> &amp;c. (<hi>as in the Bishop of</hi> Lincoln<hi>'s Popish Principles.</hi> p. 20.)
<hi>and after Excommunication, says</hi> Mariana, <hi>in case of obstinacy, the people
may take away his life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After these Affirmations of Mr. <hi>L'Estrange,</hi> if these are the principles of
the Pope and Jesuit, I hope we may safely conclude, That they that set
such little value on the sacred Dignity and Persons of Kings themselves,
when once attainted with Heresie, that not onely their Crowns are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited,
but their very Lives lie exposed to the fury and hand of every vile
Plebeian, should in all reason set less on the Rights, Priviledges, and
Lives of Subjects under the same Attainder: for no doubt, if Heresie can
make a forfeiture in the first, the Devil's in't if it does not in the last.
So that by his leave, where's all the Oaths, Honour, and all the Mighty
and Illustrious Attributes he gives our Popish Successour in vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Protestant Peace and security under him, whilst these are
the principles not onely of the Jesuits that seduced him, but of the very
Head of his Church, that Lord God the Pope? But according to his
first belief, if this were really the opinion of some Doctors, but not all,
he would do well to prove that Father <hi>Patrick,</hi> that curst Incendiary of
all our Distractions, was not one of those Affirmative Doctors, and <hi>Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningfield</hi>
his successour another of them. No doubt the subtle <hi>Rome</hi> in
converting our Heir presumptive, did not bound its ambition in the gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
one single Soul, but the recovery of a Kingdom was their designe.
In his conversion they had brought their long Hopes to a perfection, they
had found that second <hi>Moses,</hi> who under the God-like influence of <hi>Rome,</hi>
like a <hi>Cloud by day,</hi> and a <hi>Pillar of fire by night,</hi> should guide and lead
'em through all opposition and all dangers to their beloved <hi>Canaan,</hi> a Land
that flows with <hi>Milk and Honey, Rome</hi>'s old <hi>Treasure-house,</hi> that dear
<hi>Puteus Inexhaustus,</hi> England.</p>
            <p>And is it to be imagined, if <hi>Fides non est tenenda cum Haereticis</hi> were
ever in request, it should be wanting now, on so glorious an occasion;
or so inconsiderable a Trifle as a Coronation Oath should blast so forward
and so sacred a Designe. And if, as he confesses, that Tenet is onely
made use of to serve a political turn, I would gladly be inform'd what
greater or more political turn it could serve, than for the Conversion of
<hi>England,</hi> that great Work which the unknown Answerer tells us, <hi>Has, like</hi>
China, <hi>been a hundred years a ripening.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here our Answerers continue, and assure us we need have no fear
of any such prejudice in that case from our Popish Heir, considering, as
Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> says,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> L'E. If he could so scandalously play the Hypocrite as to change his
shape at that rate as the Character says, and act any part for his advantage,
which <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi>'s Interest shall impose upon him, what should have
hinder'd him from continuing a Protestant to the Eye of the World, though a
Papist in his heart? since that was the onely means to have gain'd him his
point. <hi>And as the other Answerer enlarges upon it,</hi> If out of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
of an Oath, and the Obligation he believ'd was in it, he has already
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93323:11"/>
parted with the places of the greatest Honour and Profit in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
is it likely he'll ever have a less veneration for that most religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
one he must take at his Coronation? Or is it likely if he had made
no scruple of an Oath, he would have refused it at a time when he might
have removed all suspicions and Iealousies of his Religion by it, and
thereby have facilitated his way to a Throne?</p>
            <p>Now I wonder to what Readers these Authors write, that at this
time of day they would make us believe that his squeamishness against
the Test and the Oath of Supremacy, made our consciencious Heir
quit his honourable Employments! As we better remember<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'twas
not so much the Test, as the Test-makers, that disgusted him, his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
antipathy to Parliaments, his continual little thoughts of that
Great Council, (and less of them he will have, if ever he comes to
the Crown) with his disdain that such insolent Earth and Ashes should
dare to give Laws to his Divinity. So that in short, his Pride, not
Conscience, got the Ascendant; and whatever advantages he might
have gain'd by keeping his Employments and swallowing the Oaths,
yet such is his perverse and stubborn Haughtiness, that he would rather
cry, <hi>Sink Interest, perish Succession, and even Popedom it self, rather
than truckle to what I scorn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Mr. <hi>L'Estrange,</hi> methinks, of all men should be farthest from
supposing it a difficulty in a Papist to take an Oath he never intends to
perform, when in the 4th page of his Book he grants the very Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants
themselves, nay the Church of <hi>England</hi> Protestants, upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
may do the like: Where he says,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> L'E. In the case of a Popish King, who is either kept out or dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out from the Exercise of his Right by the tumultuary License of the
Rabble, an Oath of Abjuration in case of any fair opportunity for him to
assert his Claim with his Sword in his hand, will be so far from enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
any man against him, that yielded contrary to his Conscience to
swallow it for the saving of his Stake, that he will find no firmer Friends
to his Cause or Interest, than those men that are stimulated both by Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Revenge to the execution of their Duties.</p>
            <p>Now by those firm English Friends that may take this Abjuration-Oath
against their Consciences, he cannot mean the Fanaticks; for
they 'tis supposed are the <hi>Drivers out,</hi> that impose this Oath. Besides,
Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> is so far from believing that Party capable of coming
under the denomination of a Popish Successour's Friends, that on the
contrary it has been the drift of almost all his Pamphlets to prove them
his onely implacable Enemies. Neither can those firm Friends here
mentioned, be understood the Popish Party; for upon the supposition
of this tumultuary driving out of the Popish Heir from his Right, 'tis
likewise to be concluded that Party will most of them share in his Fate;
that there will be very few of them left to be put to that Oath of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration:
or if there were, and they would take such an Oath, it would
be so far from doing their business; that lying under such a brand of
Infidelity already (as they do) all the Oaths they could ever take would
never be believed: so that the saving of their Stake that way would
be impossible. So that 'tis plain (as I said before) by those <hi>Abjuring
Oath-swallowing Friends,</hi> he can mean no other but the <hi>Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
<hi>Protestants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:93323:12"/>
And yet methinks after Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> has so long and so vigorously
play'd the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Champion, so strenuously maintain'd
the integrity and purity of that Belief and Communion, with the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
courage of its Professours, continually copying and patter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
their Perfections from a no-less sacred Original than the Fortitude,
Patience, and Perseverance of the Primitive Christians; it is a little
odd, as I may say, from a Protestant Defender, and indeed unlike him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
after all this, to lay so wretched, so despicable, and so cowardly a
Condescention at their doors; as the Abjuration of Gods Anointed
and their native Soveraign to save a Stake, a Cow, a Farm, or a Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.
Aye, but that Abjuration is but a Copy of their Countenance,
he tells you. Fie, Mr. <hi>L'Estrange,</hi> this is worse and worse! What, the
Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi>'s Communion so notoriously
break a Gospel-precept, as to come to a <hi>So help me God,</hi> with a Lye
in their mouths, and a Reserve in their Hearts, to play the Hypocrite,
and that too even with Oaths; and so do so impious an Ill that Good
may come of it! Are these the true passive obedient Sons of the
Church, those unshaken Professors of Christianity, the Martyrs that
will be upon occasion under a Romish Tyrant? But cry you mercy:
Now I think on't better, I find Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> is onely making room
for more Masqueraders; as he made the Fanaticks Papists in Masque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade,
so he intends to make the Protestants Abjurers in Masquerade.</p>
            <p>But to return to our Coronation-Oath: If the Members (as he says)
of a Religion that professes against breach of Oaths, shall yet swallow
one against Conscience for the saving a Stake, and that so inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a Stake as the possession of a Subject; I suppose he will allow
that a Member of a Religion that absolves Oaths, will not stand out
at the swallowing one for the securing so great a Stake as that of three
Kingdoms. So that without any other Evidence than his own, where's
the obligation of an Oath, or indeed the least shadow of a Trust to be
reposed in a Popish Successour?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But however, Mr.</hi> L'Estrange <hi>goes farther, and gives us an Example
of the Innocence and Indulgence of a Popish King, in favour of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants,</hi>
page 49. <hi>He acknowledges indeed,</hi> That Queen <hi>Mary</hi> did per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
the Christians: <hi>And before,</hi> page 26. <hi>he yields with the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</hi>
That she brake her promise with the <hi>Norfolk</hi> and <hi>Suffolk</hi> Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
and with a mean ingratitude to the generous Loyalty of that
people, persecuted and burnt those very men that gave her the first lift
to the Crown. <hi>But though, as he grants, all this is true, yet he says,</hi>
All Princes are not alike: Queen <hi>Mary</hi> persecuted the Protestants;
<hi>Henry</hi> the fourth of <hi>France</hi> did not so: And it is as good an Inference
from the instance of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, that a Popish Heir will not be a
Persecutor, as from that of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> that he will. But where the
Popes Authority intervenes, both King and People are bound to obey. And
yet we see, for all the power of the Pope and the Covenant of <hi>Holy League</hi>
to boot, the people of <hi>France,</hi> though Roman Catholicks, would not
submit to the dispossessing of a Protestant Successour; neither did that
generous Prince upon the reconciling of himself afterwards to the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> exercise any one act of Tyranny over his Protestant Subjects:
which is enough upon this point.</p>
            <p>Enough indeed, unless there were more Truth or more Reason in't:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93323:12"/>
For to pass by the Clemency and Moderation, he designes to prove from
the Example of this Popish King, here's one of the most notorious
falshoods averr'd that ever look'd Light i'th' face. The Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
people of <hi>France</hi> were so far from admitting this Protestant Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour
to the Throne, that 'tis recorded, they shut their very Gates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
him; and so little acknowledged him their King, that the Pope
and the States of <hi>France</hi> were for setting up no less than three Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors
against him: nay, there were such insolent indignities and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
offer'd him, that the onely cause of his changing his Religion was,
that nothing less than his Reconciliation to the Romish Faith, could gain
him his Birthright and his Crown. And all this is so plainly and so
amply testified from the French History, that never was any Assertion
more false than this of Mr. <hi>L'Estrange.</hi> And then his Inference of a
Popish Successours Lenity to the Protestants, from the instance of this
Popish King, is the weakest and shallowest that ever any man of sence
could have thought on: For this King was at best but one of Mr.
<hi>L'Estrange</hi>'s Abjurers in Masquerade; for 'tis most apparent that the
saving of his Stake, his Crown, not the dint of their Arguments or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,
the strength of the Romish power, not that of their Religion,
made him a Convert. And if this King of all mankind had proved a
Protestant persecutor, he had been a Monster indeed, and worse than
a <hi>Nero;</hi> for he must have acted quite contrary to the Dictates of his
Soul and Conscience.</p>
            <p>Now more and above all this, the Reader is here to take notice, that
out of all the Chronicles of all Ages, and of all the Popish Kings in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
this is the onely Popish Prince he has found out for an Example of
Good-nature, and a true and Favourer of the Protestants. Now I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
might I advise him, if either the Popish Records afforded no other
instance in this kind, or his Reading could not finde it out, he should
e'en throw up the Cudgels and answer no more Characters, but believe
a Popish Successor's Cause either impossible to be defended, or himself
uncapable of doing it.</p>
            <p>But this breaking of Oaths still sticks in his Gizard, and he cannot
forbear another fling at it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr.</hi> L'E. Taking his position for granted, that a Popish Prince is bound by
his Religion, to act contrary to his Oaths and Promises, Honour and Iustice,
the Dictates of Nature, the Laws of Nations, and the Bonds of humane
Society; contrary to all this (I say) and to his Interest too, be must be
unman'd as well as unchristian'd; an Excommunicate to humane Nature,
and excluded from all the Benefits and Offices of Mankind. It must be a
strange digestion sure, that can put over all other Impieties, and turn the
violation of all that is sacred in Nature into a meritorious Virtue.</p>
            <p>Never did Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> in all his Fardles of writing sum up so many
Truths as in these few lines: For indeed (as he says) a Prince that's
guilty of all this, must be both unman'd, unchristian'd, and an Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
to humane Nature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if the Gospel and Christianity be truth;
for the Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles will pronounce him such a
one, But all this while the Reader is to observe, that this great Truth
is urged by Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> in favour of his great <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> designing it
not so much to set this Brand upon a Popish Successour's perfidy in such
a case, as to let us understand 'tis a picture of a Popish Successour so
strangely deform'd, and so extravagantly monstrous, that 'tis not to be
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93323:13"/>
matcht or copy'd in Flesh and Bloud, and indeed has no being in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
But not to let him carry it off so, what does he think of <hi>Sigismond</hi>
King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> crown'd in the year 1580. who in the very exact pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel
to our present state of <hi>England,</hi> being privately bred by his Mother
a Roman Catholick, unknown to his Father, and afterwards being ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
King of <hi>Poland,</hi> openly profest the Romish Religion; but upon
his Fathers death, return'd to his Hereditary Swedish Kingdom: where
with much difficulty he was received; but under all the solemn condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and engagements that could possibly be made between Prince and
Subject, of his maintaining and upholding their Lutheran Religion. But
on the contrary, no sooner were the Reins in his hand, but with all the
fiercest Career of Infidelity, as if Hell drove him, he presently erects Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Churches, places Popish Governours in all his Forts and Castles,
encourages and countenances no other Perswasion, but striving by all
Arts imaginary to bring in the Romish Religion. Upon this notorious
Perjury his Subjects gave him the Reward which Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> has ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly
allow'd such Perjury deserv'd; they excluded him from all the
Offices and Benefits of mankind: for accusing him of breach of Faith
and mischievous practices against the Government, they deposed him.
And this was done by Lutheran Protestants, neither Presbyterian nor
Independent Fanaticks; yet with offer of crowning his Infant-son
<hi>Vdislaus,</hi> provided they might have the breeding of him in their own
Belief; which he refusing after seven years Treaties and other Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
for accommodation, all in vain, in the year 1607. they crown'd
his Uncle <hi>Charles</hi> the third Son of his Grandfather <hi>Gustavus Errichson.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now how many <hi>Bejesuited, Fanatical, Rebellious, Covenanting, Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous,
Holy-leaguing, Dissenting Psudoprotestants,</hi> would Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi>
have call'd these <hi>Lutherans,</hi> were his Pen retain'd against them? and
what Volumes would he publish in vindication of <hi>Iure Divino</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable
Succession, &amp;c. with all the Curses of Bell, Book, and Candle,
against them, as he has done against the Popish Character, for making
so slight of that indispensable Duty, <hi>Passive Obedience;</hi> though as ill luck
would have it, certainly the busie Spirit of Mr. <hi>L'Estrange</hi> was not then
in the world: for there are no such vilruent Records against them either
in any of the Historians of that Age, or indeed ever since. Now one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
I would make upon this <hi>Sigismond,</hi> to continue the parallel to
our Case: He was a Prince in his nature as Heroick as we have or can
have a Popish Heir, worthy of all those praises that either of these two
Answerers have given the last; and in short, to use one of their own
words, <hi>A Prince for every thing else, bating his Perswasion, brave to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration:</hi>
Which one thing must more particularly witness for him, his
being elected King of <hi>Poland,</hi> a Nation which we all know make their
choice for a King out of the gallant, famous, and illustrious Worthies
of all the Princes and Nobility through the whole Christian world. And
yet we fee neither Magnanimity, Justice, all the Cardinal Vertues that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd
him, nor all the promising Perfections and Accomplishments of
Nature, strengthen'd with all the Bonds of Protestations, Oaths, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
could hold the head-strong Violence of his Religion.</p>
            <p>But to return to Mr. <hi>L'Estrange,</hi> in answer to the Character's proving
how improbable, nay impossible 'tis to suppose we may have a Roman
Catholick King, <hi>That shall discountenance Popery, cherish Protestantism,
and effectually deter all those that shall endeavour to undermine or sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant
it,</hi> he says.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:93323:13"/>
As to the Influence, which a <hi>Popish</hi> Suceessor may have upon <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi>
Matters (As in the Character), There needs no more to be said in't then this;
that the King has been Gratiously pleased, to offer the passing of any Bill for
securing the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, without Barring or diverting the Succession.
And such expedients have been also framed to that effect, as have been by great
Authority judged competent for the obviating of that difficulty.</p>
            <p>The first part of this Assertion, all the world knows to be truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
if such <hi>Competent Expedients</hi> have been framed, either the <hi>Framers</hi> of them
have been the <hi>Unkindest</hi> Men in <hi>Christendom,</hi> or the three last Parliaments
the <hi>Unluckyest:</hi> The first, in either never producing or publishing those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients
for the Nations service, in this time of exigence, or the last in
never having the good fortune to meet with them; for if the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
at <hi>Oxford</hi> were not damnably mistaken, or very lewdly forgetful,
they have declared (<hi>Nemine Contradicente</hi>) that neither they, nor their
Predecessors have ever heard or seen one syllable of such a <hi>Frame of Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents</hi>
offered them; so that with Mr. <hi>Lestranges</hi> Pardon, his above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<hi>Great Authority</hi> has been greatly unkind in this Matter, or else their
expedients were like one of the <hi>Virtuosoe's Engines never design'd for use.</hi>
But he goes on. <hi>As to the rest I will not deny, but that it is a hard thing for
a Prince to teize and persecute a people of his own Religion, purely</hi> Eonomine
<hi>for their being so. And it is very probable too, that he will connive as Men
of that perswasion in many cases, where the Law directs a Punishment. And
what is there more in this, than what has been done already more or less from
the Date of the Statutes themselves to this very Day: And what is done by the
Government it selftowards the</hi> Nonconformists <hi>at this Instant! Where is the
great Crime now, (upon this Admittance) in not punishing the</hi> Papists, <hi>so long
as the</hi> Protestants <hi>are not persecuted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Reader by the by may take notice, that these two Answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
did not confer Notes, for one says a <hi>Popish</hi> Successor will be a <hi>second
part</hi> of the <hi>Immortal Brutus,</hi> and the other that he will be a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
manner of Man.</p>
            <p>But here I would beg Mr. <hi>Lestrange</hi> to explain himself: if he means by
a <hi>Popish</hi> Successors <hi>conniving at Men, of his own perswasion,</hi> to be no larger
an extent of Royal favor, than what that party have received in the two
last Kings Reigns, the priviledge perhaps of no more than a Queens or
an Embassadors private Chapple, for the visible worship of the whole
party throughout all <hi>England,</hi> then he contradicts the confessions of all
the late <hi>Popish</hi> Martyrs, for amongst all their <hi>plot silence,</hi> they unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
confess they had a fair list for a <hi>Toleration.</hi> And in case of such a
<hi>Toleration</hi> in the next Kings Reign, under a <hi>Popish</hi> Successor; wha'rs that
less than <hi>Sigismunds</hi> erecting of <hi>Popish</hi> Churches, and with them no doubt
placing <hi>Popish</hi> Governors in all Forts and Castles, <hi>Popish</hi> Ministers in all
offices of trust, with <hi>Popish</hi> Generals, and <hi>Popish</hi> Admirals upon occasion,
encouraging and countenancing no other perswasion, and striving by all
Acts imaginary of setting up the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, and all this dayly pusht
forwards farther and farther, higher and higher by Degrees. Alas! the
Character never design'd to sham such a ridiculous impossible supposition
on the world, that the Persecuting fury of a <hi>Popish</hi> King shall falt down
upon us like Fire from Heaven, all of a suddain, and no less miraculously, or
that <hi>Popery</hi> or <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Power, should grow up like <hi>Ionas Goad,</hi> in a
Night. Alas, <hi>Smith field</hi> Stakes, <hi>Lollards Towers,</hi> and <hi>Inquisition Houses</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:93323:14"/>
are the work of time; and therefore where as yet, open Hostility cannot
march, nor greater Conflagrations be attempted, they must have redress
to less Games in the mean while, the use of smaller Fire-Brands, and <hi>Foxes
Tailes</hi> to tye 'em to.</p>
            <p>In the next page he continues very smart upon the Character,
part of which to be better understood, I must be forced to repeat.</p>
            <p>Char. Speaking of a Popish successor, executing the Laws.</p>
            <p>A very pretty chimera? which is as much as to make this Popish King the
greatest Barbarian of the Creation, a Barbarian, that shall cherish and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the Dissenters from Truth, and punish and condemn the pillars of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity
and proselytes of Heaven: which is no other than to speak him the
Basest of men, and little less then a Monster. Besides at the same time that we
suppose that King that dares not uphold nor encourage his own Religion, we ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him the most deplorable of Cowards, a Coward so abject, that he dares not be
a champion even for his God. And how consistent this is with the Glory of a
Crown'd Head, and what hope <hi>England</hi> has of such a Successor, I leave all
men of sense to Iudge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Lestrange.</hi> Behold here's the upshot of his high flown paragraph</p>
            <p>[A Popish Prince that puts the Laws in execution for the punishing of Papists
and for the countenancing and protecting of Protestants, is little less then the
basest of monsters.] How comes it then that the Crown of <hi>France</hi> has not trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Protestants there, as this Pictur-drawer pronounces, that a Popish Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
would treat his subjects here? The Protestants have now and then been
severely handled, I know, in <hi>France,</hi> as the Papists upon some junctures have
been in <hi>England:</hi> and now of late wors then usuall. All which hath been
influenced as well by reasons of state, as by impulse of Religion. But shall we
pronounce the most Christian King the greater monster for his better usage of
us <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I dare defie the world to find me out that author, that ever
wrackt his Brains to labour out such <hi>mormoes</hi> as this; a discourse soe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
<hi>mal a Propos,</hi> and altogether soe little to his purpose; what
can he intend, or what would he argue from this? is there any resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
between the State of England and France; is the French King,
(as the character says) bound <hi>to condemn the pillars of christianity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes
of Heaven?</hi> or has he any Laws to <hi>put in execution against the Papists?</hi>
doe his Laws uphold no other Religion but the Protestant, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of that, declare Popery Treason, and oblige him to hang every Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Priest in his Kingdom. Is there therefore the least compulsion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him to render him that <hi>Barbarian</hi> or <hi>Coward</hi> mentioned in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.
Nay on the quite contrary is not Popery there the Establisht
Lord of the soyl, and the Protestant Religion only an inmate by toleration.
Is there any more <hi>Hugonot</hi> Churches to that Great City <hi>Paris,</hi> then one
stragling one, like our <hi>Pancras,</hi> for all the Protestants in that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous
Town.</p>
            <p>And now what if Mr. L'estrange would bring no less then 20. precedents
of good natured French Kings that have not molested the <hi>Hugonots</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them. Has not their own Religion the ascendant of the Nation, does
it not flourish and triumph in Pomp, State and Glory, whilst the poor
<hi>Hugonot</hi> perswasion only humbly truckles beneath it, and what then, if
their Royal mercy does not persecute the Protestants, is there any thing in
that mercy so monstrous or so unnatural; or is their any Laws, Restricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93323:14"/>
or Clogs upon the French King that can give such a shock to the soul
of a Papist as the Protestant Laws of England.</p>
            <p>I confess Mr. <hi>Lestrange</hi> in one clause before was much in the Right,
where he affirm'd <hi>the continuing a</hi> Protestant <hi>to the Eye of the World had been
a means of gaining the point:</hi> and 'tis no less a truth, that showing the Cards
before the playing, has often endanger'd the Game. And indeed I
have heard some smart sort of People a little Satyrical upon this Subject.
I remember a passage of this kind I read to'ther day, being an invective a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
<hi>Machiavel</hi> for an unlucky Miscarriage in one of his great Designs,
which translated into our <hi>own English</hi> runs thus.</p>
            <p>Oh! that our shallow thoughtless <hi>Machiavel</hi> should have so much zeal,
and so little Brains to manage it. Such a <hi>Bigot,</hi> such <hi>Principles,</hi> such <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,</hi>
such <hi>Infatuation:</hi> Impenetrable to all foolish effeminate thoughts of
humanity; a temper as rough, and as brutal as a second <hi>Ajax,</hi> untaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with remorse or pitty, that hates all thoughts of gratitude, friendship
and fidelity, as much as <hi>Rome</hi> loves greatness, as deaf to a Kings interest
and a Kingdoms Groans, as <hi>Romes</hi> own wish could form him. That excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
matchless engine for our work, had not this only wretched ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
blasted all, and crack't the whole foundation. Had he but play'd
the sly and wise <hi>Ulysses</hi> till under his disguise he had stoln their <hi>fatal Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi>
and left their ruind <hi>Troynovant</hi> guardianless and defenseless, our
Glory had been compleat.</p>
            <p>How might our great, our adorable Machine have succeeded, had not
this unlucky <hi>Marr-al</hi> ruind it? How might the reaking Gore of Butcher'd
Infidels have fatten'd the Land, and with the Steam perfumed the Skies,
and smelt sweet in the Nostrils of the Saints. We had a time, we had a
day, a favourable smiling Courting Hour, the morning Dawn to our
great <hi>Iubile:</hi> But oh! that dear, that blest Minute's gon. A Curse of all
unthinking greatness! How might this mighty Hunter have pursued the
glorious Game, like the immortal Roman <hi>Tullia</hi> that drove her Chariot o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
her murder'd Fathers heart, and Rod tryumphant o're the crackling
Bones of Majesty, had he not so rashly pull'd off the Vizard too soon, thus
senselesly turn'd up his Cask, and show'd the fatal Face within it. And
by that only accurst unfortunate Act, waken'd a whole alarum'd Nation
to snatch the Reins, from this bold Rider, and cry, <hi>stop Iehu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Well, but Mr.</hi> Lestrange, <hi>through almost all his whole Pamphlet is
still upon the impossibility of</hi> Popery, <hi>and</hi> Arbitrary Powers <hi>advance into</hi>
England. <hi>Page 82. he says,</hi> take the matter as they suppose it, a King up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Throne that's principled for Arbitrary Government and Popery, but so
clogg'd and shackled with Popular and Protestant Laws, that if he had never so
great a mind to't, there's not one Subject in his Dominions, that would dare to
serve him in his Design.</p>
            <p>Now the King of <hi>France</hi> we see has made himself absolute<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that
as I take it by the help of his Subjects; and why <hi>English</hi> Men should not
dare to do any thing, that the <hi>French</hi> have done before them, I cannot
understand. Neither do I find, but a <hi>Popish</hi> King might not only have
good <hi>Irish Hands</hi> out of his Dominions, but good <hi>English ones</hi> too upon
that occasion, for besides his <hi>Popish</hi> Friends, we have but too many of
all Religions, but more of no Religion at all, whose desperate Fortunes
would make their hearts leap at so pleasing a motion, and push for a
change at any rate to fish in troubled Waters, and that too notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93323:15"/>
               <hi>the hazard of their Necks, upon a Scheame of Law which he proposes Pag.
40, to be form'd for that purpose.</hi> Nay that Scheame of capital Laws should
serve for an incentive to their Resolution, and make 'em wade the deeper,
the more unsafe and dangerous it should be to retire.</p>
            <p>In the foregoing Page he says,</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Lest.</hi> that possibly there may be a <hi>Popish</hi> King that may not have the
will to change the Government, in respest of the immorality of inclinin to
such a violation of his trust and word, but most certainly not, in regard of so
manifest an inability to bring it to pass.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis evident the Plotters and Jesuites have not believed it such an
impossible exploit, and why may not a Prince of their own Opinion, and
their own Industry for <hi>Rome,</hi> upon the presumption of whose principles
and for whose sake their whole Machine moved; with a Crown on his
head, and a Sword in his hand believe as they do? So that were there a
real inability in the case, yet if the blindness of zeal and the over-sight of
Ambition shall not distinguish that inability to be <hi>manifest</hi> till the event &amp;
fatal success has proved it so, what shall that hinder his endeavors in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
and prosecuting it, and then where's the certainty of his will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it.
And these endeavors once prosecuted amidst all the violent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodes
or subtle Attaques that shall be made for <hi>Popery</hi> and Slavery, no God
ha' mercy to his Kindness for't, it is none of his fault that he lays his Bones
by the seige, and does not live it out to put us to <hi>Storm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I need not insist how far the Peace, Prosperity and Freedom of this
once flourishing Kingdom will suffer under such a seige and how far they
will be dayly harass'd and gall'd with so potent and so pressing an Enemy.
At best they must expect to have their Laws snapt asunder as often and as
fast as <hi>Sampsons</hi> cords, and their City gates in the scuffle twing'd off, and if
at last they play the Philistians, and live to pick out both his Eyes for't, the
end of all must terminat in <hi>Sampsons</hi> fate, they'll have an old heavy roof
pull'd down both upon his head and theirs together.</p>
            <p>The next thing Mr. L'estrange falls foule upon, are the Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
recited in the character, and here he either tells the Reader <hi>they
are nothing to the characters purpose,</hi> or if they are, he finds such flaws in
the Law-makers that made them, that they are <hi>unreasonable,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
<hi>void</hi> in themselves, as you shall hear anon. And so he fairly
trips up the heels of Kings, Lords and Commons at once, and makes
their whole authority insignificant because their Laws are against Mr.
L'estranges inclination.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First, he's very angry with the character,</hi> for advancing the Popish Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesour
first from the Possibility of a good man, then from bad to wars, and
at last to a downright Traitor: and that from a statute of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
that declares every subject of England, that shall take absolution from Rome,
or own the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Popes supremacy, or pay any Fealty to the See of Rome guilty of
High Treason. <hi>And then he answers this by saying,</hi> there are two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visoes
in the Act that makes the case somwhat different from what the
Characteriser has Stated it. viz.</p>
            <p>1 Provided alway, that for as much as the Queens Maiesty is otherwise suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
assured of the faith and loyalty of the temporal Lords of her high Court of
Parliament: Therefore this Act, nor any thing therein contained, shall not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to compell any Temporal Person, of or above the degrée of a Baron of this
Realm to take or pronounce the Dath abovesaid, (viz. of Supremacy) nor to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93323:15"/>
any penalty, limited by this Act for not taking or refusing the same (&amp;c.)</p>
            <p>2. Provided also, that if any Péer of this Realm shall hereafter offend contrary
to this Act, or any Branch or Article thereof, that, in that and all such case and
cases, they shall be Tryed by their Péers, in such manner and form as in other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of Treasons they haue used to be tryed, and by no other means.</p>
            <p>Now I would defie any impartial Reader to Judge if ever any thing
was so weakly and so impertinently urged as these two Provisoes. The
first tells you that the Queen was so assured of the Loyalty of her Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
that she would not put them to the trouble of Swearing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it, as the Law required from her Inferior Subjects, but on the other
side the second Proviso tells us that notwithstanding that, if any of
them offended against the Law or any Branch or Article of it, they should
find no more Mercy than the meanest Commoner in her Kingdom, but
be equally Tryed for High Treason. Now what he drives at by this
objection or what favor these Provisoes make for a Popish Heir, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
I cannot Imagine, neither do I believe he knows himself.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Upon this he comes to a touch of Conscience, and says;</hi> It would be
well if every man that presses with this unprecedented rigor upon the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
here in Question, would lay his hand upon his Heart, and say, if
the King has Pardoned me Ten Thousand times more than this comes to,
with what reason or Conscience can I Importune His Majesty thus bitterly
against his Brother.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ten Thousand times more</hi> than this comes to, is a very great dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.
But thus much I am certain, for the Heir of a Protestant
Kingdom, and the Son of a Protestant Martyr, to be perverted to the
Religion and Interest of <hi>Rome,</hi> so notoriously destructive to the <hi>English</hi>
Government, and thereby to be the cause of all those Distractions in the
Nation, that tye up the Hearts and Hands of the Subject, from their
Duty to the best of Princes, and weaken both his greatness at home,
and his Alliance abroad; and not only this, but to be seduced to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion,
in such a juncture of Affairs, on whose only score, have all the
late Conspiracies against His Majesties Sacred Life been contrived and
animated, This I say, is bad enough, but to find out a man Guilty of
Ten Thousand times more than this comes to, and Pardoned for it too,
is (to use his own word) to give us an Original of an <hi>unprecedented</hi> Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal,
and as <hi>unprecedented</hi> Mercy. But if he intends this as a lash
against the Author of the Character, I'le venture to clear him, for to
my knowledge, he is a Person so far from laying his hand on his Heart,
and owing any Benefit to Royal Pardons or Acts of Oblivion, that I must
say this truth for him. <hi>Ianuary 48</hi> was past before he was Born.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the next Page he confesses that the Strongest Argument he finds in
the whole Character is this. Char.</hi> if ever a Papist mounts this Throne,
then all their murmurs their petitions, protesting and Association Votes
will be remembred to the purpose, <hi>upon which he makes this remark.</hi>
Mr. <hi>L.</hi> Now what can be a greater Indignity to the Iustice and Resolution
of that Illustrious Body (viz. <hi>the Parliament</hi>) then to imagine so narrow
a thought could any way influence the Candor and Solemnity of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates.</p>
            <p>Yes, indeed, what greater indignity then to imagine it. For if as
the Character <hi>says,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lestrange grants,</hi> they will be remember'd
to the purpose, and the Heretick Dogs, upon his mounting into the
Throne may live to be hang'd for their Barking, what greater indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93323:16"/>
to the Courage and Resolution of those Illustrious Patriots then to
imagine they'le slacken their Votes and Debates against a Popish Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
for fear of his Revenge. So cowardly a thought indeed (as he
says) would be <hi>too narrow</hi> for the Souls of <hi>English</hi> Men.</p>
            <p>From this he comes to the main point the Characters proving the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
of the <hi>English</hi> Crown to be wholly subjected to the disposal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
and Limitations of Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Parliament (says the Character) 25 of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>9th,</hi> setled the Crown
upon the Heirs of that Kings Body by Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> and in the 28 repealed
that Act, and intayl'd the Succession upon the Heirs of his Body by Queen <hi>Jane,
Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> being declared illegitimate. And in case they died without
issue then the Parliament Empowr'd him by the same Act to dispose of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
by his own Letters Patents or his last will. In the <hi>35th.</hi> Year of his
Reign the Parliament granted the Succession to <hi>Edward,</hi> and for want of the
Heirs of his Body to the Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Heirs of her Body, and for want of
such Heirs to the Lady <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> under certain Limitations and Conditions
contain'd in that Act.</p>
            <p>But to prove all this nothing to his purpose he makes these six Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Lest.</hi> First, he says the Charasteriser infers that a Parliament may Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
or Dispose the Succession. But whither they may or no, here's little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
proved from these Citations. First under the ambiguity of the word <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
he would have this thought to be the single Act of the Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
when the Enacting authority of it was solely in the King. <hi>This first
Objection has more quibble than reason in it, and deserves no serious
Answer. For the Character is so far from starting up an Ordinance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of an Act of Parliament, that no man of sense can extort any such
meaning from him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly he says.</hi> These Statutes do not so properly transfer a Right, as
declare and notify the Persons, for the prevention of disputes and competitions,
as appears by the preamble to that of the <hi>28th.</hi> Statute.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we your most humble and obedient Subiects, in this present Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
Assembled, calling to our Remembrance the great Divisions which in times
past have been in this Realm, by reason of several titles pretended to the Imperial
Crown of this Realm. which sometimes and for the most part ensued, by occasion
of ambiguity and doubts, then not so perfectly declared, but that Men might upon
froward intents expound them to every Mans sinister Appetite and Affection, and
Posterity of the lawful Kings and Emperors of this Realm; whereof hath ensued
great Effusion and Destruction of Mans Blood, as well of the great Number of
Nobles, as of other the Subiects, and especially Inheritors in the same, And the
greatest Occasion thereof hath been, because no perfect and substantial Provision
by Law hath béen made within this Realm it self: When doubts and questions
have been moved and proponed of the certainty and Legality of the Succession,
and Posterity of the Crown, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>L<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Now so far is the intent of this Act from diverting the Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the express end of it was the setting of it right, by the avoidance
of a former settlement upon the nullity of the Marriage. And afterward
26th. of the same King. cap. 2. The Act here before mentioned is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:
<hi>The Act for the establishment of the Succession of the Heirs of
the Kings Highness in the Imperial Crown of this Realm.</hi> Mr. <hi>L.</hi>
Now there's a great deal of difference betwixt translating the Succession
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93323:16"/>
from the wrong to the right, and the diverting it from the right to the
wrong.</p>
            <p>Now certainly never had any objection less sense in it then this, for if
this Act impowr'd the King upon the failure of <hi>Edward, Mary</hi> and <hi>Eliz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abeth,</hi>
to give the Crown to whome he pleased, as really it did, and
that must be expounded to give it only to the <hi>next right Heir.</hi> Now
their could be but one right Heir in the case, and consequently if that
<hi>right</hi> ought to possess, the empowring the King, to dispose of the
Crown where he pleased, was downright nonsense and a palpable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
in the very words. So that for instance had <hi>Henry</hi> the
<hi>8th</hi> Upon presumption of this Act, out of some particular inclination,
bequeath'd the Reversion of his Crown to a Tenth Cozen removed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of a First, and this Law had been to have been read by Mr. <hi>L'e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stranges</hi>
Spectacles, the very end they made it for, (<hi>viz.</hi>) to keep peace
and quiet had been utterly destroy'd; for instead of Reconciling all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
between future pretenders, and fixing the succession, it had only
given new occasions for fresh Feuds, and so the Parliament had only wisely
made an Act to ruine the very <hi>intent</hi> of it's <hi>Creation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. L.</hi> Thirdly, this change and disposition of settlement though it pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all the formalityes of Bill and Debate, yet the First spring of it was from
their certain knowledge of the Kings Pleasure to have it so, without which they
durst never have ventred on such a proposition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. L.</hi> Fourthly, matter of Fact is no proof of Right, and especially a Fact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with so many circumstances of <hi>cross Capers</hi> and contradictions, as
the pronouncing of the same persons to be both Illegitimate, and legitimate,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And a Man cannot imagine, without a scandal to that Grave and
Wise Assembly, that the levity of those Councels and that humor of Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Counter-swearing could be any other than the caprice of their new
Head and Governor.</p>
            <p>Now pray observe the slyness of this slur he puts upon Majesty: He
cunningly insinuates that Matter of Fact may not be Matter of Right,
and that when the <hi>Humor, Caprice</hi> or <hi>Pleasure</hi> of a King influences the
Votes of his Parliament to make it so.</p>
            <p>Now upon concession of Mr. <hi>Lestranges</hi> opinion, here's a broad gate
opened for a Rebellion; for by his Argument 'tis but disallowing the
rightfulness of <hi>Hearth money,</hi> and indeed almost all the rest of the
Kings Revenues because the King generally askt the Parliament money
first, and so since the <hi>first spring of those grants were from the knowledge
of the Kings pleasure to have it so,</hi> 'tis but Mr. <hi>L'estranges</hi> denying the
matter of right in this case, and so he makes the King a Tyrant to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
his own, and thereupon encourages the Subject to the most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
undutifulness and disloyalty in nature. Now those <hi>cross Capers</hi>
and <hi>contradictions,</hi> as he calls them, in declaring the same Persons one
while <hi>Illegitimate</hi> and afterwards <hi>legitimate</hi> is one of the greatest Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
that the conservation of a Nations Peace, was held a greater
piece of Conscience in that Age, then the maintaining the right of
Blood, when Illegitimacy it self upon occasion could be restored to the
power of Succession. Neither was there any such <hi>Swearing</hi> or <hi>Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swearing</hi>
or any such levity (as he calls it) in that grave Assembly, for
the Oath they enjoyn'd the People in fidelity to the Kings Heirs could
have no other meaning than whilst they were <hi>Lawfully</hi> so, and in all
Justice the Obligation of it expired in course, when the <hi>Law</hi> declared
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93323:17"/>
them no longer such. Nor was it indeed any more than the Tenure of
our present <hi>Oath of Allegiance,</hi> in which we swear to be <hi>faithful to the
King's lawful Heirs and Successors,</hi> which the Ignorance of some People
has used as an Argument against the changing of Succession; as think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
they have sworn fealty to the next of Blood, whereas in reality
there's nothing in that Oath that binds them to the <hi>Person</hi> but the
<hi>Thing,</hi> to no particular Man any further than as he is <hi>Heir</hi> and <hi>Successor,
Lawfully</hi> so, and no Man truly is either <hi>Heir</hi> or <hi>Successor</hi> til he <hi>Inherits</hi>
and <hi>Succeeds,</hi> and as 'tis most ridiculous to think the intent of an Oath
of Allegiance is to make a Man Swear Loyalty to a fellow Subject, as
as the greatest <hi>Heir</hi> apparent is no more whilst the King Lives, so the
duty of that part of the Oath cannot necessarily be understood to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence or take effect till the present Kings death, and then if in the
mean while the absolute Power of the Land, the King, Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
have constituted a new Heir and Successor, the obligation of that
Oath of Allegiance can have no other Aspect, then to the Heir and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor
so constituted.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Lest,</hi> fithly, with Reverence to the utility and constitution of good and
wholesome Laws, it is not presently to Cite a statute and say, <hi>there's a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi>
for those Laws that are repugnant to the <hi>Light of nature</hi> and <hi>Common
Right</hi> are Nullities in themselves.</p>
            <p>Now heres one of the boldest Master strokes of the pen that ever
came in print. This point once gain'd, all the <hi>Protestant</hi> Laws since the
reformation, and the whole fabrick of the present Government are total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
subverted. 'Tis but a <hi>Popish</hi> Successors believing aud maintaining that
all the <hi>Protestant</hi> Laws ever since <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8ths.</hi> perversion are against
the <hi>light of nature,</hi> and consequently <hi>Nullites in themselves:</hi> So down
goes the <hi>Protestant</hi> Church, up start the old Statutes <hi>de Haeretico comburen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi>
the old <hi>Smith field</hi> Fire-works, whilst <hi>Popery</hi> comes in in the open face
of day most triumphantly introduced even by the awful Divinity of Law
and Justice for its Supporters. So that after all Mr. <hi>Lestranges</hi> Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>Honor, Honesty, Veneration of Oathes, Performance of Laws,</hi>
and <hi>Preservation of the</hi> Protestant <hi>Religion</hi> in a <hi>Popish</hi> Successor, he has
very subtly sound him out an Evasion to be a greater Tyrant and Devil
than the Author of the Character could paint him, and that too with
all the Innocence in the World, and even without the least Blemish of
Infidelity. But to come a little nearer to him, in the first Place these Acts
for the settlement of the Crown were so far from being repugnant to the
Light of nature, that on the contrary 'tis evidently manifest that the Law-Makers
that made e'm mov'd by no other Guide or Light but that. For
since <hi>self Preservation</hi> is the first and greatest thing that the light of nature
teaches all Mankind, the very preamble to the Acts confirm us that <hi>the
preservation of themselves and their Heirs in Peace and Tranquillity, and to
avoid the future Effusion of</hi> English <hi>Blood,</hi> was the sole End and Design of
those Acts.</p>
            <p>Secondly these Acts have nothing repugnant or destructive of common
right. For if by common right, he implies a right to any possession or
pretension derived from human Power and the Laws of Man, then 'tis
plain by the Constitution of our Government, where our Laws are not
like these of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> that the Law-makers that <hi>gave</hi> can
<hi>take,</hi> and in that respect there's no right so firm, which the absolute
Power of the Law lying in the three States in Parliament cannot shake.
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93323:17"/>
But if by common right he means a right derived from the Laws or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
of God, and therefore those Acts of Parliament are nullities in
themselves, because repugnant to the Rules and Duty of Christianity.
Then he would do well to tell us when that Law of God was made or that
Command given. But that there is no such Law nor any such Rules of
Christianity is plainly to be demonstrated from the most eminent prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of holy writ; where we find proximity of blood has been so far from
challenging that unalterable Right of Empire that on the other side there
have been several Changes of Kings made in that case even amongst Gods
own People and that always by his <hi>Consent,</hi> and sometimes by his special
<hi>Order.</hi> Besides if any such Law of God had been made, and left us in
holy Scripture, 'tis certain that Law ought to have no more obligation
over one <hi>Christian</hi> Kingdom than another, and then consequently <hi>Venice</hi>
and <hi>Holland</hi> that have no Kings at all, and <hi>Poland</hi> that always elect their
Kings, by Mr. <hi>Lestranges</hi> Inference live Age after Age in continual Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Common Right, the Duty of Christians, and the Laws of God.
I do confess I have heard of a Command of <hi>Christ</hi> that says, <hi>Let every
Soule be subject unto the higher Powers; for there is no Power but of God;
whosoever therefore resisteth the Power resisteth the Ordinance of God, and
they that resist shall receive to themselves Damnation;</hi> and therefore if the
higher Powers of <hi>England</hi> the King, Lords and Commons are an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
of God too, it is an Article of my Creed, That he that denies
their Authority and Power, and not content with that only, endeavors
to perswade and seduce the rest of his fellow subjects to the same denial
is not only a Traitor to his Country, but from Christs own Sentence shall
receive, if possibly, a double Portion of Damnation.</p>
            <p>But now for his Sixth Observation on this Statute.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. L.</hi> Lastly he brings instance here to prove that a Parliament may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the succession, but he shows withal, that there can be no security even in
that Exclusion, showing that what one Parliament does another may undo, so
that now we are upon equall Tearms of security or hazard, either in the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the successor or in restraining him, for if he be tyed up by one Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
another may set him at Liberty; and if he be excluded by one Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
another may take him in again.</p>
            <p>Now certainly this is the most comical humor I ever met with, to advise
a Parliament to have a care of excluding a Papist for fear another Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
restore him. Perswade e'm to fear that once, and make e'm Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of fancyes and <hi>Chimeras</hi> indeed. But to dissipate all shadows of any
such dangers, there are some heads as wise as Mr. <hi>L'estranges</hi> (no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragment)
that are of opinion if one English Parliament once exclude a
Popish successor we may safely defy Five Hundred Parliaments after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to restore him. The disinheriting of a Popish successor being a
kind of <hi>Limbus,</hi> that if we have once got him into it, 'tis damnable odds
that all the intrest of <hi>Rome</hi> with Ten Millions of <hi>Masses</hi> never get him
out of it. I must confess if we could have a Parliament of Mr. L'estranges
particular choosing, the <hi>Consistory</hi> of <hi>Cardinals</hi> for the House of Lords,
and <hi>St Omers Colledge</hi> for the House of Commons much might be; but
till then we are pretty safe in that point.</p>
            <p>But amongst all Mr. L'estranges despicable thoughts of the Decrees
and power of Parliaments in Henry the Eight's days, he clearly forgets
to answer that Act of Parliament of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> mentioned in the
Character, in which 'twas made Treason for any man to affirm that the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93323:18"/>
disposal of the Imperial Crown of England lay not in the Queen and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and indeed that Act comes so near the present face of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
in England, that it was made upon the selfe same occasion, that
the Bill of Exclusion was endeavour'd by the late Parliaments, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
with an intention of putting by <hi>Mary Queen of Scots</hi> the then next Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish
Heir from the Succession, had not her Conspiracy against the Life
of the Queen, put an end to all farther care, by the forefeiture of her
head. But these Six Objections with the help of <hi>Common Right</hi> and the
<hi>Light of Nature</hi> may serve to answer both; and truly Mr. L'estrange has
given us the top of his Politicks, and the utmost strength of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for the defence of a Popish Successor, in opposition even to the
Supreme Authority of the Nation, and against all the precedents of
Laws and History. But alas! what signifies Supreme Authority, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents,
Laws, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There's nothing so sacred which stands in their
way, that the Champions of <hi>Rome</hi> must not endeavor to overthrow,
and when the Popish Interest cries <hi>Halloo,</hi> they must <hi>Bark</hi> at least
though they cannot Bite. Now 'tis plainly to be discovered at what
Foundation he strikes, by lessening and enfeebling the <hi>Legislative</hi>
Power of the Nation, and though he wisely lays the Scene at such
distance as the remoter Age of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> yet we understand where
he aims the lash he gives, and what Gall his Ink's made of. But
truly in his Remarks and Reflections upon the <hi>Capriches</hi> (as he calls
them) of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> with the weakness of his great Council,
the shallowness of their Debates, and the invalidity of their decrees, he
chooses the safer Subject. The Majesty he reviles, and the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
he ridicules, being so long since inoffensive Dust and Ashes, that
he has this Reason for his Boldness, and this shield for his Defence.
<q>
                  <l>Nulli gravis est percussus <hi>Achilles.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But to answer those strait-laced Consciences that so vehemently main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and assert Succession to be <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> and cannot be alter'd by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
human Laws, I will put this instance.</p>
            <p>Suppose a King has two Sons, the eldest of which, ambitious of a
Crown, and mislead by the ill Counsel of his Priests, favourites or the
like, conspires to depose his Father, and in Order thereunto, confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
with some neighbouring Monarch; who upon assurance given him,
by this Aspirer of resigning of some part of his Dominions to him, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
tributary to him, furnishes him with Money and Men, by which
assistance he flies out into an open Rebellion against his Father, upon w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
the Father commissions his younger Son to fight this Rebel Prince, who
beats him, and makes him fly out of his fathers Dominions to that confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
neighbours Protection, upon which the King with the unanimous
consent of his loyal Subjects passes an Act for a total Exclusion of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
son from the Crown, and to place the Succession in the younger.
Now will any Man say that this is not warrantable and just both by the
Laws of God and Man. For if it be unwarantable, and that this Rebel
Prince must still suceeed, then consider what follows.</p>
            <p>Frst, here's a manifest obstructing of the distribution of the greatest
Justice both human and divine. For whilst this Prince continues safe by
his Flight, and his forreign Protection, from any personal Sufferance for
his Crimes, and at the same time 'tis granted he cannot suffer in his
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93323:18"/>
               <hi>Birthright,</hi> then this indispensable continuation of succession confers the
greatest Earthly felicity and reward <hi>viz.</hi> a Diadem on the greatest of
Criminals, one <hi>Doubly</hi> a Traitor not only against the Lords anointed, but
even to the Fountain of his own Royal Blood, and the Author of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
a Father.</p>
            <p>Secondly; it makes crown'd Heads the most miserable State of all man
kind; nay they are below the meanest Peasant in their Kingdoms: For
the vengeance of a Subject, having the Power to disinherit, shall persue
a Rebel son even to the <hi>East Indies,</hi> whilst a King, who they say, <hi>has, or
should have long hands</hi> shall notwith all his thunder reach the worst of rebels
cross the next Sea, or perhaps the next County. So that where's their
boasting themselves to be Gods Vicegerents, when they alone of all Men
are most debarred that greatest Prerogative of a Diety, REVENGE.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3d,</hi> By this means Majesty that should be most sacred, and the person of
it most religiously guarded, and defended, lies more exposed than all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
besides, for if it be true that.
<q>
                  <l>Filius ante diem patrios inquirit in annos.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And the lust of Inheritance makes the Blood of the Impatient Heir
boil high for possession, then 'tis most true, where the Inheritance is
Greatest, and the Temptation Strongest, as in the case of a Crown,
that there the Blood boiles highest. And if so, and Birth-right be
still unforfitable, then to the strongest Temptation here's the least dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and the greatest Encouragement for gratifying that lust, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing
all such tempting desires. So that upon this position,
who so arm'd for a Traitor as he that's Born to a Crown, and who
so unsafe as he that wears it. But surely 'tis inconsistant with that
particular care, that God takes for the Preservation of Kings, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail
that <hi>Ius Divinum</hi> upon them, that places them infra <hi>statum Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However to give a little clearer light into this great point of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
I shall trouble my Reader with one instance more.</p>
            <p>It cannot be disputed but that either <hi>Queen Mary</hi> or Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
did succeed to the Imperial Crown of <hi>England</hi> not by <hi>Divine Right</hi>
of Succession, since Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was Born whilst Queen <hi>Katha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>
the Mother of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> was living, but one of them must
undoubtedly enjoy the Crown <hi>Iure Parliamentario:</hi> if the latter, (as
cannot be denyed) and that Succession is <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> then she was
an <hi>Usurpess</hi> upon the Right of the House of <hi>Scotland:</hi> and what then
is the consequence of all this!</p>
            <p>First, it shakes, and strikes at the Foundation of the Church of
<hi>England,</hi> which derives all its Power and Authority from the Crown
which began in King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8ths,</hi> and were more fully confirmd
by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and therefore the Church of <hi>England</hi> was set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by a Princess <hi>de facto</hi> and not <hi>de jure,</hi> insomuch that it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
the very <hi>basis</hi> of the Hierarchy and Ecclesiastick power, and the
order of the whole Clergy, who derive their Distinctions and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
from that Queen.</p>
            <p>2ly. It may call in Question all the Grants of that Queen, which
have not been confirmed by the <hi>Scottish</hi> Line, and destroy the many and
great Priviledges conferr'd on both the Universities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:93323:19"/>
3ly. According to the Rule of <hi>Ius Divinum</hi> it may raise a Question
hereafter of what validity those Honors are which that Queen was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to confer upon several great and eminent Families.</p>
            <p>Lastly it would well become many worthy and learned Men seriously
to consider whether they do not labor to do the Work and Drudgery of
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who assert so fatal a Principle, whereby they
make Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> an Usurpress, and build the superstructure of
the Protestant Religion, the right of the Church, and the Legality
of the whole Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> upon such a sandy and ruinous Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
as the High and Mighty <hi>Ius Divinum.</hi> But if we will allow
that Princess our lawful Queen, which I hope no Man will have the
Impudence to deny, then the disposal of the Crown by Parliament is
just.</p>
            <p>But if <hi>Ius Divinum</hi> that lay buried 44 Years together must make a
Resurrection in our present Distractions of <hi>England,</hi> and both <hi>Honor</hi> and
<hi>Conscience</hi> render an exclusion Bill unlawful, how came the proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of making a Popish Successor but a <hi>Nominal Prince,</hi> and setling
the Administration in Protestant hands: If that may be, then here's
<hi>Ius Divinum</hi> quite laid aside: for Divine Right of Birth entitles a Prince
to the power as well as the name of a King, and if that right be
sacred and inviolable, no <hi>one</hi> part of it more than another ought or
can <hi>lawfully</hi> be <hi>alienated.</hi> But if the <hi>greatest part</hi> of it be by the
<hi>greatest Authority</hi> allow'd <hi>justly Alienable</hi> by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament,</hi> there's
an end of all Divine Right, and a <hi>concession</hi> of the <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,</hi>
insomuch that if they may <hi>legally</hi> take away the <hi>Kernel,</hi>
and leave only the <hi>Husk</hi> of Succession, by the same Authority they
may as well take away <hi>both:</hi> and a <hi>total</hi> Exclusion is no more repugnant
to <hi>Honor</hi> or <hi>Conscience</hi> then an Exclusion <hi>in part.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if any Man has a curiosity to examine the Effects of Exclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<hi>in part, viz.</hi> Limitations and Restrictions that have been put
upon the <hi>English</hi> Crown, I will only advise him cursorly to run over the
contests between King <hi>Iohn</hi> and the <hi>Barons; Henry</hi> the <hi>3d, Edward</hi> the
<hi>2d,</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> the <hi>2d</hi> and their Barons, and the troubles of <hi>Henry</hi>
the <hi>6th,</hi> and the several Agreements made between him and the D.
of <hi>York,</hi> and he'le easily satisfie himself that notwithstanding the several
Agreements Restraints and Limitations put upon the Crown, and
those confirm'd not only by Acts of Parliament but solemnly ratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Face of <hi>Heaven</hi> by many <hi>Oaths</hi> and dreadful Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
by the Church, yet none ever held: but so soon as those Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments
were dissolved, or the first opportunity or advantage happen'd,
those Kings by the ill advice of their <hi>Favourites</hi> and <hi>Minions</hi> broke all,
whereupon both parties flying to Arms, the King accusing them of
<hi>Treason,</hi> and they <hi>Him</hi> of <hi>Perjury,</hi> the rise of all those long and bloody
Civil Wars had no other ground but this.</p>
            <p>But to back his last six Arguments in defence of the Succession we find
him for the next three or four Pages together corroborating his Opinion
with the practice of the primitive Christians. First he tells you <hi>'tis a Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
precept not to do ill that good may come of it, such as the unwarrantable
devesting of a Prince of his Birthright though for any safety or preservation
whatever. So that in the case of</hi> England <hi>supposing it would come at last to a
down-right persecution under a</hi> Popish <hi>Successor, yet to stand upon our</hi> Guards
<hi>to prevent it would be more than ever the primitive Christians did under the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:93323:19"/>
ten Persecutions; and we have not only their Example but their express Doctrine
against it.</hi> And therefore (as he says in another place) <hi>'tis our Duty to
bless God for the Peace and Happiness we now enjoy, and rather wait his far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
pleasure with thankfulness and resignation, then with murmuring and
a<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>trust to Anticipate future Evils and Prejudge Providences to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now never was any thing more plausibly managed to so little purpose,
for the Correspondence between ours and the primitive Christians case
is here so incoherently Ballanced, that never were Arguments more So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistical.
The primitive Christians preacht Obedience to <hi>Nero,</hi> yes,
and they had forfeited their Christianity if they had done otherwise, but
what was that <hi>Nero,</hi> an absolute Monarch: and what those primitive
Bishops? not such as ours, they were not a part of the Legislative Power
of the Nation, as our Prelates are. If <hi>Nero</hi> invented Wracks, Tortures
and Gibbets for persecuting or murdering the poor Christians, he did it by
his own uncontroulable Authority, nor were those primitive Bishops
call'd to make Laws, and therefore had not the lawful power of the least
Vote in Moderation of <hi>Neroes</hi> Cruelty, or in Redress of the Christians
Torments. I am sure if they had had any such voting or law-making
Power, and yet out of a base principle of cowardly Fear on one side, and
like fordid Sycophants out of a servile Flattery of <hi>Neroes</hi> barbarous Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
on the other side, had neglected the means, (as much as in them lay)
of preventing those Persecutions, they had been rather <hi>Wolves</hi> then <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds</hi>
over the flock of Christ, and Accessaries to all those Butcheries that
<hi>Nero</hi> committed against them. For not to oppose where opposition is
lawful, is to permit, and to permit is to Act. So that there would not
have been that Engine made to rend the Tortured Christians Bones, that
they them selves in so doing had not lent a helping hand to the wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of it up. Nor is it to be doubted but that if those Primitive Prelates
had had those Sacred Recorded Statutes, those Royal decrees, Presidents
and Laws before 'em, wherin the disposal of the Crown under which
they lived had lain in the Absolute Power of the Nation, it being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
no less then Treason to deny it, and that the Kingdoms safety
in despight of Birth-right had sometimes Authorized the change of the
Sucession; had these Prelates, I say, lived under such a Government, and
at the same time sat at the Helm like ours, it is to be presumed upon the
certain prospect of a next Successor of known Principles of Barbarity
and persecution, with the Innate implacable inveteracy against Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
and Christianity; they would boldly and unanimously have
endeavored and Voted for his Removal, and whatever Obedience they
Preacht to a <hi>Nero upon</hi> a Throne, they would have thought it neither an
Obligation of Conscience or Christianity to have lent their Assistance to
the mounting a <hi>Nero into</hi> a Throne. So that 'tis more than likely under
such a Power and such Circumstances they would have stood upon their
<hi>Guards,</hi> (as the Character says) against so dangerous and so fatal a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession;
not stood upon their <hi>Guards,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Lestrange</hi> interprets it,
<hi>with their Swords in their hands,</hi> but as the Author meant it, with their
Eyes and Tongues in their heads and resolution in their Soules, to see the
real dangers themselves and their Religion are in, and to propose and
provide all lawful and necessary means to prevent them.</p>
            <p>Nor would they upon second thoughts with Mr. <hi>Lestranges</hi> tender
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93323:20"/>
Conscience have judged this legal &amp; manly Resolution in defence of their
Religion to fall under the <hi>Premunire</hi> mention'd in the <hi>3d.</hi> P. of his Book,
<hi>a Prostituting of their Soules to save their Skins and Fortunes.</hi> This I am
sure, they could never with Reason or Religion have judged it any such
Prostitution, but if they had made Religion and Conscience the <hi>Pretence</hi>
to judge it so, and thereupon had directed and managed all their <hi>Studies,
Labors, Endeavors, Votings, Preachings, Insinuations</hi> and <hi>Encouragements</hi>
for the Establishment of such a Successor, they might very seasonably
fall under as severe a scandal, and I am sure as justly deserved, as what
Mr. <hi>Lestrange</hi> has given the <hi>Fanaticks</hi> under the Name of <hi>Papists in Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querade;</hi> for in this case the wiser part of the World would have shrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
suspected they had been more <hi>Heathens</hi> in <hi>Masquerade,</hi> than <hi>Christians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is there (by Mr. <hi>Lestranges</hi> Permission) that incumbent Duty
upon Christianity, to be so wholly employ'd in blessing God for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Peace and Prosperity, as to wait his farther Pleasure and Providences
to come with so intire a Resignation, till we neglect a lawful Preservation
when approaching Ruine threatens us; he that by the Blessing of God
stands upon the firm Shore and sees that terrible and unusual Torrent
come rowling on, which in Probability may break the banks and drown
him, is so far from being oblidged to an idle standing still, and a resig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to the will of Providence, whether the Innundation shall break
in, and he sink or swim: That if he miscarries by that idle neglect of
himself, it will not at all clear him from being accessary to his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
(and therefore answerable for it) by excusing himself to God,
and saying, Lord, I submitted to thy pleasure.</p>
            <p>From this we come to the <hi>Characters</hi> Doctrin of <hi>Passive Obedience,</hi>
which the <hi>Character</hi> avows may be laid aside under the Tyranny of a
<hi>Popish</hi> Succession; in answer to which we have Mr. <hi>L'estrange</hi> very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
against him, for so bold and so dangerous a position, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
if there be any glimpse of Reason throughout his whole answer
'tis there; but however that the Authors Opinion may not appear so
strangely enormous, nor his position so wholly destructive to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and so opposite to Christianity, as his answer would render
it; let us venture to make a little explanation of the Character. First
then to distinguish what that Tyranny is which he justifies we may
lawfully oppose, and what Invasion that, we may justly repel, I must
refer the Reader to the <hi>Character</hi> page 22d.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Char. What does this Popish King by admitting the Popes Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy,
but divest himself of half his Royalty, whilst like the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior
King of <hi>Brentford</hi> in the play he resigns and alienates the Right
hand power of Majesty to an Invader and Usurper; and thus we are
enslaved by a medley Government betwixt Tyranny and Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
and again. <hi>page 6.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Char. If he be a Man of Justice that still makes for <hi>Rome,</hi> for
whilst he believes the Pope to be Christs lawful Vicar, and that
Office includes the Ecclesiastick Supremacy, no doubt but he'le
think it as much the duty of his Christianity to give the Pope his
right as to take his own. So that upon this supposition of the Popes
Supremacy restored, the Author has stated both our <hi>Tyrants</hi> and our
<hi>Slavery.</hi>
               </q> But to return to Mr. <hi>L'estrange. page 73.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>L.</hi> In our Oath of Supremacy we swear that the King is the ON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93323:20"/>
SUPREME, Governor SUPREME, so none, (not the Pope) above him, and ON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY
SUPREME, so none coordinate or equal with him.</p>
            <p>If so, and the King is Supreme Governor <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> and <hi>Civil,</hi> and
a Popish King notwithstanding shall alienate half his Supremacy to
the Pope, then the Pope is <hi>co-King</hi> with him; and that it may not
be objected that Supream <hi>Ecclesiastick Power</hi> is not <hi>Kingly Power,</hi> where
the <hi>Highest</hi> and <hi>last Appeal</hi> lyes, there lyes <hi>Royal Power,</hi> and therefore
whilst the highest and last appeal in all causes Ecclesiastick, in such a
Government is lodged in the Pope his Power is <hi>Royal.</hi> For it would
be very absurd to say that a Supreme Moderator in causes betwixt
<hi>Man and Man</hi> should be a <hi>Kingly</hi> Governor, and a Supreme Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator
in causes between <hi>God and Man</hi> should be <hi>none.</hi> That were to
place a <hi>Majesty</hi> in that Authority that says <hi>Thou shalt not steal,</hi> and
none in that that says <hi>Thou shalt have no other Gods but me.</hi> 'Tis
true the Pope to mince the matter, and to Sham upon those Romish
Kings that Admit of his Church Supremacy, very cunningly usurps
the <hi>Prerogative</hi> without the Name, and therefore wherever he is
Supream <hi>Iudge,</hi> he lets the Temporal Soveraignty be still the Supream
<hi>Sheriff,</hi> for whereever his Tribunal condemns, the <hi>Popish</hi> King is <hi>Hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Generalissimo</hi> to execute. Yet still in reality his Power is never the
less Kingly, when we see that this Popish Executioner under him, is
so far from the Exercise of any Regal Authority in his <hi>Sheriffalty,</hi>
that he's but a substitute of the Popes, and accountable to the Pope
for the least neglect or misdemeanor in his office of that kind, so
that the reestablishment of the Popes Supremacy here, is setting up a
<hi>new</hi> Kingly Power. But by what Title? None. For granting his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
of old was his <hi>right</hi> whilst he <hi>possest</hi> it, yet considering that
right has been lost above a Hundred years together, by the Laws
of Conquest 'tis now wholly expired, and he can lay no more claim
or pretence to't after so long an alienation, then the <hi>Christians</hi> to
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> or the <hi>Danes</hi> or <hi>Saxons</hi> to <hi>England.</hi> Now 'tis a known
Maxim in <hi>England</hi> that a King of himself cannot give, sell, or alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
all, or part of his hereditary Soveraign Power, neither can he
any more restore the Pope (out of a freak of conscience) to his Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
or his Abby Lubbers to their old fat pastures, then he can
say to the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> Sir, lay claim to half <hi>England</hi> and 'tis
yours, and therefore land a colony in the West of <hi>England,</hi> and
Crown your self <hi>King</hi> there, whilst I content my self with the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty
of <hi>York-shire,</hi> and two or three more Northern Counties
about it. Nay suppose a King should say so, and this <hi>Saxon</hi> Prince
upon that presumption should come, and make a Seisure, there's ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
a Subject in <hi>England,</hi> notwithstanding their Lawful Soveraigns
special Gommand to them to yeeld Obedience to this usurping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading
<hi>Saxon,</hi> that may not justly and with a safe Conscience op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
this <hi>Invader,</hi> and shoot him though the heart at the very first
step he makes into <hi>England.</hi> For whatever passive Obedience is due
to our <hi>Native</hi> Prince we have none due to a <hi>Forreign Invader.</hi> So
likewise 'tis a plain case that the Popes Supremacy entring into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
is an Invading and Usurping <hi>Royalty.</hi> For though we are bound
to pay fealty, to what ever <hi>Deputies, Viceroys,</hi> or <hi>Subministers</hi> the King
shall Ordain or Institute under him, yet the Popes Supremacy can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
come under that name, for it ceases to be <hi>Supream</hi> if there be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93323:21"/>
a Power above it. So that whenever the King shall say to the Pope
assume your Prerogative, there's never a Subject of <hi>England,</hi> that may
not by violence rescue an Heretick from a Stake that's condemn'd by
that Prerogative, or any delegated Authority from the Usurped Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
of the Pope, nay if they burn the very Tribunal about those Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suitish
Judges eares that pronounced that Hereticks Condemnation,
they may <hi>Iustify</hi> the Fact both to their King and their God.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Papist in Masquerade</hi> draws now near to a Conclusion, and gives
the Characteriser a dead doing blow at last stroke, by the Argument rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against the <hi>Characters</hi> position, <hi>that Kings were made for the People, and
not the People for the Kings.</hi> Though by the way the Characterisers asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is not only one Drs. opinion; for if he will allow King <hi>Iames</hi> to have
as much sense as himself, we shall find him, (if we may take his Royal
word for't) a little leaning towards the Characters side, witness this
clause in one of his Speeches in Parliament. <hi>Anno 1603.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As I am a Head and Governor of all the People in my Dominions, who are
my natural Vassals and Subjects considering them in number and distinct
Ranks; so if we take the People as one Body and Mass, then as the Head is
ordeind for the Body, and not the Body for the Head, so must a righteous King
know himself to be ordain'd for his People, and not his People for him; for
though a King and his People be <hi>Relata,</hi> yet can he be no King if he want Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and Subjects; but there be many People in the World that lack a Head, <hi>&amp;c</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But no matter for all this, Kings are but Men, and this human Error
of King <hi>Iames,</hi> must not dare to oppose the more sacred Authority of Mr.
<hi>Lestrange.</hi> For to bafflle this gross Mistake of them both, he continues,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But after all these Words, to shew that Government originally was not popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
I shall add a few more to prove the Institution of it to be purely Divine;
which Opinion, in truth, needs not any other support then the Authority of the
holy Scriptures.</hi> By me Kings reighn <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I have made the Earth, the Man,
and the Beasts that are upon the Ground by my great Power, and my
Out-stretch'd Arm, and have given it to whom it seem'd meet unto
me <hi>Ier.</hi> 27th. 5.</p>
            <p>Now I cannot find by this Text: <hi>By me Kings raighn</hi> &amp;c. But that
by me Subjects possess their lawful Inheritances might claim the same
right. For an Empire to a Monarch and a Lordship to a Subject, a <hi>Naboths</hi>
Vineyard, or an <hi>Ahabs</hi> Kingdom are equally the Gift of God, and by
our Authors reasons may equally pretend to a <hi>Divine Iustitution.</hi> Neither
is there so much <hi>Support</hi> as he calls it in this holy Authority, but I can
match it with another as holy and as much to his purpose, which tells us,
<hi>not a Sparrow falls to the Ground without the will of my Father,</hi> &amp;c. Now
if no King reighns without him, and no Sparrow falls without him; a
Manmight ask him why the holy Authority of this last Text might not
make the falling of a Sparrow have as much of divine Institution in it
as the Enthroning of a Monarch. Nor can I perceive that there lies
so much stress in <hi>Gods giving the Government of the Earth, Man, and
Beasts to whom it seem'd Meet to him,</hi> as to <hi>Nebuchadnezar</hi> in the Text,
but that a <hi>MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARZIN,</hi> written by
the Almighties own hand against his impious Heir, the <hi>sacrilegious Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
Balshazar</hi> was as much the Word of God, and had as much
<hi>divine Institution</hi> in it as by <hi>me Kings raign.</hi> But to proceed in our
Authors argument.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>L.</hi> That which we now call Kingly Government was at First called
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93323:21"/>
Paternal, and after Patriarchal <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And we sind by the powers they excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
<hi>&amp;c. And so he advances in a Florid Descant upon this Subject till he
lodges the first</hi> Paternal Kingly <hi>Government in Adam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here you may perceive he's harping at the old <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> but
I shall wave that point of dispute, and even with granting his supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
true, out of his own opinion invalidate the chief argument of all
his discourse, and the Fundamental Design of his whole pamphlet,
<hi>(viz:) Unalterable Right of Succession.</hi> If then (as he says) the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archall</hi>
power was <hi>Kingly,</hi> how comes it to pass that <hi>Esau</hi> forfeited
his <hi>Royal</hi> Inheritance? and <hi>Iacob</hi> his younger Brother got it from him;
nay the alienation of his Birthright (as <hi>Regal</hi> and as <hi>Divine</hi> as our Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querader
would have it,) was transferd to the younger Brother even by
God himself, and that too (as we read in Gods promis to the Mother)
before they were born. Nay though the Father <hi>Isaac</hi> had no prejudice
against <hi>Esau,</hi> but resolved to make him his Heir, and accordingly sent
him for venison to cherish his heart, that he might receive his <hi>Blessing</hi>
and with it the Assurance of his <hi>Inheritance;</hi> yet when <hi>Iacob</hi> by Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and his Brothers borrowed Name had deceived the Father, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
the Blessing, we find the grant of his Inheritance, though fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
obtain'd was so far from being retracted, that the Fathers promise
and word even to the <hi>Counterfeit Esau</hi> was more sacred, then all the
formidable ties of Blood, and the inviolable Right of Succession. Now
I hope, our wise Author will not quarrel with <hi>Isaacs</hi> Injustice and
appeal to the <hi>Light of Nature</hi> and <hi>Common Right</hi> for the Redress of
<hi>Esaus</hi> wrongs. Perhaps it may be objected rhat <hi>Esau</hi> sold his Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
foolishly for a <hi>Mess of Pottage,</hi> though that we find had no
influence on <hi>Isaacs</hi> Determination, yet if a <hi>Royal Birth-right</hi> could
be sold or forfeited either by the Folly or Fault of the Heir, where's
SUCCESSION? and if in our present State of <hi>England</hi> we have
an Heir of those corrupted Principles, and that depraved Infatuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
till he has prodigally forfeited his <hi>Fathers</hi> and his <hi>Grand-Fathers</hi>
Blessings, the one having sealed the <hi>Protestant</hi> Faith with his Blood,
and the other having particularly entayl'd a curse upon all his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny
that should ever Apostatise from the <hi>Protestant</hi> Truth to the
<hi>Popish</hi> Superstition, if we have an Heir so bewitcht by the <hi>Charms</hi>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> which like the <hi>Syrens</hi> songs can convert Reason into Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
or rather like <hi>Circes</hi> Bowles transform Men into Swine, why not
the Prodigals fare the husks, a more proper Reward from him, than a
<hi>Coronation Festival.</hi> This I am certain, if he had <hi>Esaus</hi> Fate, the <hi>Blessing</hi>
and <hi>Inheritance</hi> should go together.</p>
            <p>I shall only instance one particular more out of holy Writt, I hope
his <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the last Paragraph will allow the <hi>Iudges</hi> of <hi>Israel</hi> were a <hi>Kingly</hi>
Power as well as the Patriarchal, and that they may indeed appear so, we
find their Government the most agreeing with the present Monarchy of
<hi>England,</hi> for they had the Power of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death, Peace</hi> and <hi>War</hi> in
their Prerogative, but then as a Restriction against <hi>Absolute</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary</hi>
power, (like our Common and Ecclesiastick Laws) their Constitution
of Government was limited and confined withing the establisht and recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Mosaick Law</hi> which was the ultimate Verge of their Jurisdiction both
<hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Spiritual.</hi> Now here in the case of <hi>Samuel</hi> Judge of <hi>Isreal</hi> we
find him parting with his <hi>Royalty</hi> and conferring it upon his two Sons e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in his own Life time: after that we find the <hi>Israelites</hi> disgusted against
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:93323:22"/>
their ill Government and asking for a <hi>King,</hi> that is such a <hi>King</hi> as
<hi>those of the Nations round about e'm, viz.</hi> an <hi>Absolute Monarch.</hi> And
upon this <hi>Saul</hi> stept up into the Throne. Now here we may observe
there was so little Regard had to the Right of Succession that their law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Judges even after possession were divested of their Royal Dignity,
and that too (mark it) not only upon the <hi>Peoples Request,</hi> but even by
a Command from the immediate Voice of <hi>God,</hi> without the lest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
of the Duty of <hi>passive Obedience</hi> to <hi>Samuels</hi> Sons those cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
Judges of <hi>Isreal.</hi> And though it may be objected that God
was angry with the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> for their desires of <hi>Change,</hi> in
that they had follow'd other Gods, and that this asking for a King
as we read) look'd like rejecting of him that had brought e'm out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
and deliver'd them from the Hands of their Enemies, yet since
God complyed with that desire, no Man must say, this Change was
unlawful or the removal of their Royal Judges unjust. But in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
to all this, our Masquerader will not want a Justification for
the unalterable Right of Succession, nay rather than stand out at a
dead Lift hee'll start you up a common Right and a Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
that upon occasion shall supersede even the Records of Scripture
and the very immediate Acts of God. Nay we find, after the Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that more absolute <hi>Iewish</hi> Monarchy which began in <hi>Saul,</hi> that
his very next Successor was a Stranger to his Blood, a Man of a
quite different Family; in so much that <hi>David</hi> the <hi>Man after Gods own
heart,</hi> a man so eminently beloved of the Almighty, that from his
Loyns the promis'd <hi>Messias</hi> should procceed, was a Prince so far from
owing his Crown to the Right of Birth and Blood, that he was
anointed King even in his Predecessors life in spight of the Greater sons of
<hi>Saul</hi> those nearer and juster pretenders to the Crown had Birth-right
given e'm title to it. But so Early a sea-mark did God set up against that
fatal Rock, <hi>unalterable Succession;</hi> and so timely a care did the great
Founder of Empires, the Divine Omnipotence take, to show that the
Dispensations of Majesty for his <hi>Peoples good</hi> and his own <hi>Glory,</hi> were to
be preferr'd before the Soveraignty of <hi>Birth,</hi> that blinder gift of Chance.
But to come a little down to our own age, even in all our latest Modern
constitutions of Monarchy, and that not only in <hi>England</hi> but all the
Christian Kingdoms in <hi>Europe,</hi> we find there is not altogether that infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
in Birth right, but that <hi>Fools</hi> and <hi>Mad-men</hi> notwithstanding their
proximity of descent are excluded from Empire, so that by Mr. <hi>Lestranges</hi>
permission a <hi>Shallow Perecranium</hi> or an <hi>Addled</hi> one upon occasion shall put
very good Royal veins out of play. So that to make Monarchy go a
little hand in hand with our new natural Philosophy, some Criticks will
tell you, that the Life of it lyes more in the <hi>Head</hi> than the <hi>Heart,</hi> that
is, in the <hi>Brain</hi> than the <hi>Blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that I need not stray far for an Instance, have we not had a late
King of <hi>Portugal</hi> deposed as <hi>Delirious</hi> and <hi>Frantick</hi> and consequently ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
by Law uncapable of reighning, and all this done by his own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
and those of his own Religion, without the least Reflection of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or Rebellion or the Aspersion of lifting a hand against the Lords a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed.</p>
            <p>Nay if truth might make bold in <hi>England</hi> there be those that dare
honestly venture to say there must go so strong a Dose of <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
or indeed both together to make up the composition of a <hi>Popish</hi> Heir
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93323:22"/>
to the <hi>Protestant</hi> Crown of <hi>England,</hi> especially an Heir that can be fond
of the <hi>Gugaws, Bawbles</hi> and Trumpery of the <hi>Romish</hi> Superstition as
to hazard three Crowns for them, and that too by an Apostacy from a
native Hereditary <hi>Protestant</hi> Faith, not only derived down to him, but
more signally sealed by a Royal Fathers Martyrdom, a light which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
would shine through all the mists and fogs the <hi>Iesuitish Magick</hi>
has or can cast about him, though thicker if possible then the <hi>Egyptian
Darkness</hi> it self, a Darkness to be felt; were there not a Skull in the case
more than strangely impenetrable, and a <hi>Cerebellum</hi> if possibly more than
supernaturally impedimented: so that if in Truth he but fairly stood the
Test of an old Statute we have already, the <hi>Begging</hi> of his <hi>Reversion</hi> would
be so feasible that it would be cross we won, and pile he lost.</p>
            <p>But to come yet a little nearer to the mark, as it is most undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
true that Soules are never <hi>Generate,</hi> and consequently not always
derived from the <hi>Father</hi> that <hi>Begets,</hi> it sometimes so falls out by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price
of some ill natured planet, or to come to a more Christian notion,
by the indisputable Will of Omnipotence that moulds the Clay as he
pleases, to make such infinite disproportions in the unequal distributing of
those sparks of his own Celestial fires call'd soules, that so much over
rule the inferior Mass of Flesh and Blood, and sometimes so far Estrange
and alienated a Son from the <hi>Nature, Temper,</hi> and indeed almost <hi>every
thing</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> till it does worse then <hi>Bastardize</hi> even <hi>Legitimacy</hi> it
self.</p>
