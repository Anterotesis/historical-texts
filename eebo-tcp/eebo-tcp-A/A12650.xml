            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

and in this behalfe, as almost in all other, shee hath
the most honourable and knowen Ladies of the
land, so common and knowen witnesses, that those
that least liked her religion were in loue with her
demeanour, deliuering their opinions in open prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
How mildely she accepted the checke of fortune
fallen vpon her without desert, experience hath bin
a most manifest proofe, the temper of her mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
so easie that she found little difficultie in taking
downe her thoughts to a meane degree, which true
honour, not pride had raised to the former height,
her faithfulnes and loue where she found tru frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
is written with teares in many eyes, and wil be
longer registred in gratefull memories diuers that
haue tried her in that kinde, auowing her for secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,
wisedome, and constancie, to be a miracle in that
sex, yea when shee found least kindnesse in others,
she neuer lost it in hirselfe, more willingly suffering
then offering wrong, and often weeping for their
mishappes, whome though lesse louing her, shee
could not but effect. Of the innocencie of her life
this generall all can auerre, that as she was gratefull
many wayes, and memorable for vertues, so was
shee free from the blemish of any vice, vsing, to
her power, the best meanes to keepe continually an
vndefiled conscience: her attire was euer such as
might both satisfie a curious eye, and yet beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of a sober minde, neyther singular nor vaine,
<pb facs="tcp:11449:8"/>
but such as her peeres of least report vsed: her tong
was very little acquainted with oathes, vnlesse ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
duetie or distrust did enforce them: and surelie
they were needelesse to those that knewe her, to
whome the trueth of her words could not iustly be
suspected, much lesse was she noted of any vnfitting
talke, which as it was euer hatefull to her eares, so
did it neuer defile her breath: of feeding shee was
very measurable, rather of too sparing then too libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
a diet: so religious for obseruing all fasts, that
neuer in her sickenesse shee could hardly bee wonne
to breake them, and if our soules be possessed in our

with distempered words or ill seeming
actions, reason neuer forgetting distancie, though
remembring pitie, her deuotions she daily obserued,
offering the daily sacrifice of an innocent heart, and
stinting her selfe to her times of prayer, which shee
performed with so religious a care, as well shewed
that shee knew howe high a Maiestie shee serued. I
neede not write how duetifully shee discharged all
the behoofes of a most louing wife, since that was

And now may we say that the Sparrow hath

If she were in possibilitie of preferment, shee coulde

then shee would bee by enioying fortunes fauour,
which if it be not counted a follie to loue, yet it is a
true happinesse not to neede, we may rather thinke
that death was prouident against her imminent

times being great with so many broiles, that when
they once fall in labour, we shall thinke their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

monstrous issue that they are likely to bring foorth:
the more you tender her, the more temperat should

some for growing, and some for reaping, in this
only different, that as the heauens keepe their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
periods, so the succession of times haue their
appointed changes. But in the seasons of our life,
which are not to the lawe of necessarie causes, some
are reaped in the seed, some in the blade, some in the
vnripe eare, all in the end, this haruest depending
vpon the reapers wil. Death is too ordinarie a thing
to seem any nouelty, being a familiar guest in euerie
house; and sith his comming is expected, and his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
vnknowen, neither his presence should be fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb facs="tcp:11449:14"/>
nor his effects lamented. What wonder is it to
see fuell burned, spice pownded, or snow melted? and
as little feare it is to see those dead that were borne
vpon condition once to die, she was such a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pound
as was once to be resolued vnto her simples, which
is now performed: her soule being giuen to God,
and her body sorted into her first elements, it could
not dislike you to see your friend remoued out of a
ruinous house, and the house it selfe destroyed and
pulled downe, if you knewe it were to build it in a
statelier forme, &amp; to turne the inhabitant with more
ioy into a fairer lodging. Let then your sisters soule
depart without griefe, let hir body also be altered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
dust, withdraw your eyes from the ruine of this
cotage, &amp; cast them vpon the maiestie of the second
building, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith shall be incorruptible,
glorious, strange, spirituall, and immortall: night and
sleep are perpetuall, mirours, figuring in their dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
silence, shutting vp of sences, the finall end of our
mortal bodies, &amp; for this some haue entituled sleep
the eldest brother of death; but with no lesse conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
it might be called one of deaths tenants neare
vnto him in affinity of condition, yea far inferior in
right, being but tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for a time of that which death
is the inheritance; for by vertue of the conueiance
made vnto him in Paradice, that dust we were &amp; to
dust we should returne. He hath hitherto shewed his
signiorie ouer all, exacting of vs, not only the yere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but hourely reuenues of time, which euer by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuts
we defray vnto him: So that our very life is not
only a memorie, but a part of our death, sith the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
we haue liued, the lesse we haue to liue. What is
<pb facs="tcp:11449:15"/>
the daily lessening of our life, but a continual dying:
and therfore none is more grieued with the running
out of the last sand in an houre glasse then with all
the rest: so should not the end of the last houre trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
vs any more, of so many that went before, sith
that did but finish course that all the rest were stil en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
not the quantity but the quality commendeth
our life. The ordinarie gaine of long liuers being
onely a great burthen of sinne: for as in teares, so in
life the valew is not esteemed by the length, but by
the fruit and goodnesse, which often is more in the
least than in the longest. What your sister wanted
in continuance, she supplied in speede, and as with
her needle shee wrought more in a day than manie
Ladies in a yeere, hauing both excellent skil, and no
lesse delight in working, so with her diligence dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
her endeuours, shee won more vertue in halfe
than others in a whole life Her death to time was
her birth to eternitie, the losse of this worlde an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
of a better, one indowment that she had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
impaired, but many farre greater added to her
store. <hi>Mardocheus</hi> house was too obscure a dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
for so gracious an <hi>Hester,</hi> shrowding royall
partes in the mantle of a meane estate, and shadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
immortall benefits vnder earthly vailes. It was
fitter that shee being a summe of so rare perfections,
and so well worthy, a spouse of our heauenly <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shuerus</hi>
should bee carried to his court from her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
abode, there to be inuested in glorie, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy
both place and preheminence answerable to her
worthines, her loue would haue beene lesse able to
haue borne hir death, than your constancy to brooke
<pb facs="tcp:11449:15"/>
her, and therefore God mercifully closed her eies
before they were punished with so grieuous a sight,
taking out to you but a newe lesson of patience out
of your old booke, in which long studie hath made
you perfect. Though your hearts were equally bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced
with a mutual and most entire affection, and
the doubt insoluble which of you loued most, yet
death finding her the weaker, though not the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
vessell, laide his weight in her ballance to bring
her soonest to her rest: let your mind therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to that which your tongue daily craueth, that
Gods will may bee done as well here in earth of her
mortall body, and in that little heauen of her purest
soule, sith his will is the best measure of all euents.
There is in this worlde continuall enterchange of
pleasing and greeting accidence, still keeping their
succession of times, &amp; ouertaking ech other in their
seuerall courses: no picture can be all drawen of the
brightest colours, nor a harmonie onely conforted
onely of trebles: shadowes are needefull in expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of proportions, and the base is a principall part
in perfect musicke, the condition of our exile heere
alloweth no vnmedled ioy, our whole life is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered
betweene sweete and sowre, and wee must all
looke for a mixture of both: the wise so wish: bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that they stil thinke of worse, accepting the one
if it come with liking, and bearing the other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
impatience, being so much maisters of eche o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
fortunes, that neither shall worke them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse.
The dwarse groweth not on the highest hill,
nor the tall man looseth not his height in the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
valley, and as a base mind, though most at ease,
<pb facs="tcp:11449:16"/>
wil be deiected, so a resolute vertue in the deepest
distresse is most impregnable. They euermore most
perfectly enioy their comfortes that least feare their

to loose; and both desire &amp; feare are enemies to qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et

then tenants at his wil: the cause of our trobles
are that our misfortunes happen either to vnwitting

necessitie the other: for he taketh away the smart of
present euilles that attendeth their comming, and is
not amated with any crosse, that is, armed against al,
where necessitie worketh without our consent, the
effect shoulde neuer greatly afflict vs, griefe being
bootlesse, where it can not helpe, needelesse where
there was no fault: God casteth the dice, and giueth
vs our chance, the most wee can doe, is, to take the
point that the cast will affoord vs, not grudging so
much that it is no better, as comforting our selues it
is no worse. If men should lay al their euilles toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to be afterwardes by equall portion diuided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, most me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would rather take that they
brought, than stand to the diuision; yet such is the
partiall iudgement of selfe-loue, that euery one iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
his selfe-miserie too great, fearing if he can find
some circumstance to increase it &amp; making it intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable
by thought to induce it. When <hi>Moses</hi> threw
his rod from him, it became a serpent ready to sting,
and affrighted him, insomuch as it made him to flee,
but being quietly taken vp, it was a rod againe ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiceable

and thy staffe haue been my comfort. In this, afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
resembleth the Crokadile, flie, it pursueth and
frights, followed, it flieth and feareth, a shame to the
constant, a tyrant to the timorous. Soft mindes that
thinke only vpon delights, admit no other conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
but in soothing things becom so effeminate,
as that they are apt to bleede with euery sharpe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression.
But hee that vseth his thought<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of troubles, making their trauell through
all hazards, and apposing his resolution against the
sharpest incounters, findeth in the proofe facilitie of
patience, and easeth the loade of most heauy cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:
we must haue temporall things in vse, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
in wish, that in the one neither delight exceed
in that wee haue no desire in that wee want: and in
the other our most delight is here in desire, and our
whole desire is hereafter to enioy. They straighten
too much their ioyes, that draw them into the reach
and compasse of their sences, as if it were no facilitie
where no sence is witnes, whereas if we exclude our
passed and future contentments, pleasant pleasures
haue so fickle assurance, that either as forestalled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their arriuall, or interrupted before their ende,
or ended before they are well begunne: the repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of former comfortes, and the expectation of
after hopes is euer a reliefe vnto a vertuous minde,
whereas others not suffering their life to continue
in the conueniences of that which was and shall be
diuided, this day fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> yesterday, &amp; to morrow, &amp; by
<pb facs="tcp:11449:17"/>
forgetting all, and forecasting nothing, abridge their
whole life into the moment of present time: enioy
your sister in your former vertues, enioy her also in
her future meeting, being both titles of more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
delights, than her casuall life could euer haue
warranted. If we will thinke of her death, let it be as
a warning to prouide vs, sith that that happeneth to
one may happen to an other: yea none can escape
that is common to all. It may be the blowe that hit
her was meant to some of vs, and this missing was
but a proofe to take better aime in the next stroke: if
we were diligent in thinking of our own, we shuld
haue little leasure to bewaile others deaths: when
the souldior in skirmish<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seeth his next fellow slaine,
he thinketh more time to looke to himselfe, than to
stand mourning a haplesse mischance, knowing the
head which sped so neere a neighbour, cannot be far
from his own head. But we in this behalfe are much
like the seely birds, that seeing one sticke in the lime
bush, striuing to get away, with a kind of natiue pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
are drawen to goe to it, and so rush themselues
into the same misfortune; euen so many for their
frends decease by musing on their lot, wittingly sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet
of too much sorrow, that sometimes they make
mourning their last decease: but steppe not you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
this roile, that hath taken none but weake affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
holde not your eies alwayes vpon your hardest
happes, neither bee you still occupied in counting
your losses. There are fairer partes in your bodie
than scarres, better eye-markes in your fortune then
a sisters losse; you might happily finde more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
left than you would willingly loose. But that
<pb facs="tcp:11449:17"/>
you haue alreadie resigned the solaces of life, and
shunned all comforts into the hopes of heauen, yet
sith there is some difference betweene a purpose and
proofe, intending and performing; a subdued enemy
being euer ready to rebell when hee findeth mighty
helpes to make a partie. It is good to strengthen rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
against the violence of nature, that in this and
like cases will renew her assaults, it was a forcible
remedie that hee vsed to withstand the conceit of a
most lamentable occurrent, who hauing in one ship
lost his children and substance, and hardly escaped
himselfe from drowning, went presently into an
hospitall of lazars, where finding in a litle rome ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
examples of greater miseries, hee made the smart
of others sores a lenatiue to his owne wound: for
besids that, as lownesse &amp; pouerty was common to
them, they had also many cumbers priuate to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
some wanting their sences, some their wits,
other their limmes, but all their health, in which
consideration he eased his minde, that fortune had
not giuen him the greatest fall. If God had put you
to <hi>Abrahams</hi> triall, commaunding you to sacrifice
the hope of your posterities, and to be to your one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sonne an author of death, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s you were to him of
life. If you had bin tied in the streights of <hi>Iepthaes</hi>
bitter deuotion in bruing his sword in his owne
daughters blood, and ending the triumphs ouer his
enemies with the voluntarie funeralles of his onelie
of-spring: yet sith both their liues and their labours
had bin gods vndeemable debt, your vertues ought
to haue obeyed maugre al incounters of carnall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And how much more in this case should you
<pb facs="tcp:11449:18"/>
incline your loue to Gods liking, in which hee hath
receiued a lesse part of his owne, and that by the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall
easiest course of natures lawes. Let God strippe
you to the skinne, yea to the soule, so hee stay with
you himselfe: let his reproch be your honour, his
pouertie your riches, and he in lue of al other frends.
Thinke him enough for this world, that must be all
your possession for a whole eternity: let others ease
their carefulnes with borrowed pleasures, not bred
out of the true roote, but begged of externall helps.
They shall still carry vnquiet mindes, easily altered
with euery accident, sith they labor not any change
in their inward distempers. But by forgetting them
for a time by outward pastimes, innocencie is the
only mother of true mirth, and a soule that is owner
of God, will quietly bare with all other wants, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
beeing able to empouerish it but voluntarie
losses. Beare not therefore with her losses, for shee
is won for euer, but with the momentarie absence
of your most happie sister, yea it can not iustly bee
called an absence, many thoughts being daily in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee
with her, onely mens eies and eares vnwoorthie
to enioy so sweete an obiect, haue resigned their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
and interested this treasure in their hearts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the fittest shrines for so pure a Saint, whome as
none did knowe but did loue, so none can nowe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
with deuotion. Men may behold her with
shame of their former life, seeing one of the frailer
sexe honour her weakenesse with such a traine of
perfections. Ladies may admire her as a glorie to
their degree, in whom honour was portraied in her
full likenesse, grace hauing perfected natures first
