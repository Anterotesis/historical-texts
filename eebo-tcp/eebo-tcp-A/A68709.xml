            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the firſt act, his Maieſtie ratifeis and appreuis the trew profeſſiou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Goſpell, ſinceir preaching of the word, and adminiſtratioun of the Sacramentis, preſently be the gudenes of God eſtabliſhit within this Realme: &amp; allowis of the confeſſioun of the faith ſet doun be acte of Parliament the firſt ȝeir of his Maieſties Regne.

            <p>IN the ſecou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d act, his Maieſties royall authoritie ower all eſtaites, both ſpirituall and temporall, is confirmit. Quhilk act, ſome of malice, and vtheris of ignorance dois traduce, as gif his Maieſtie pretendit to be callit the heid of the Kirk, Ane name quhilk his Maieſt. acknawlegis to be proper and peculiar to the ſonne of God, the Sauiour of the warld, quha is the heid, and beſtowes life ſpirituall vpoun the members of his miſticall bodie: and he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing reſſauit the holie ſpreit in all aboundance, makis euerie ane of the faithfull pertakers thairof, according to the meſure of faith beſtowit vpoun thame.

affrayit of his awin gyltines, being priuie to dyuers conſpiraceis of before, fled into the Realme of England. quhais nauchty and preſumptuous refuſing of his Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes iudgement, was the occaſioun of the making of the ſecound act, That nane ſoulde declyne his Hienes authoritye: in reſpect that the common prouerbe beiris, <hi>Ex malis moribus bonae leges natae ſunt,</hi> that is, Of euill maners gude Lawes procede. And in verie deid it laketh not ane richt intollerable arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie in ony ſubiect, callit before his Prince, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, &amp; authoriſing the ſamin treuth, to diſclame his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie: nether do the Prophetes, Apoſtles, nor vthers conductit be the ſpirit of God, miniſter the lyke exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. For it is a great errour to affirme, as mony do, that Princes and Magiſtrats hes only power to take ordour in ciuile effaires, and that Eccleſiaſticall maters dois only belang to the miniſtry. Be quhilk meanis, the Pape of <hi>Rome</hi> he exemit him ſelf &amp; his clergie from al iuge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Princes, and hes made him ſelf to be Iuge of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and to be iugit of na man: quhair as, be the contrair, not only be the exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples of the godly gouernouris, Iuges and Kings of the ancient Teſtament, bot alſo be the new Teſtament, and the haill hiſtory of the primitiue kirk, in the quhilk, the Emperours iugeit ouer the Biſhoppes of <hi>Rome,</hi> depoſit them from their ſeates, appointit Iudges to cognoſce &amp; decyde in cauſis Eccleſiaſticall, vindicat innocent men, as <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> from the determinatioun of the concile haldin at <hi>Tyrus,</hi> and be infinite gude rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſouns, quhilk fall be ſet doun, be the grace of God, in ane

Bot, praiſit be God, we haue no ſic controuerſies in this land, nather hes there ony hereſie taken ony depe rute in the cuntrey: bot certane of the miniſtrie, ioyning tham ſelfis to rebellis, hes trauellit to diſquiet the eſtate with ſic queſtiouns, that the people micht imbrace ane ſiniſtre opinioun of his Maieſties vpright proceidinges and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiouns micht be nuriſhit and intertenyit in the cuntrye. Nather is it his Maieſt. meaning nor intention in ony ſort to tak away the lawfull and ordinarie iudgement in the Kirk, quhairby diſcipline and gude ordour micht decay: bot rather to preſerue, maintene, &amp; increſſe the ſame. And as thair is in the Realme Iuſtices, Conſtables, Shirreffis Proueſtis, Bailleis, and vtheris Iudges in temporall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris, Sa his Maieſtie allowith, that all things micht be done in ordour, and ane godlie harmonie may be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the haill eſtait, the ſynodall aſſembleis, be the Biſchoppes: or commiſſionaris quhair the place vakis, to
