         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hoſoever deſires this totall change of
our preſent government, deſires it either
out of a conceit that it is <hi>unlawfull,</hi> or
<hi>inconvenient.</hi> To both theſe I ſhall ſay
ſomething. To the firſt, being able to
make no ſuch arguments to prove it ſo
my ſelfe, as I conceive likely to be made within the
walls of ſo wiſe a Houſe, I can make no anſwer to
them till I heare them from ſome other; which then
(if they perſwade me not) by the liberty of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
I ſhall doe. But this in generall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the meantime
I ſhall ſay, that the ground of this government of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy
being ſo ancient, and ſo generall, ſo uncontra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
in the firſt and beſt times, that our moſt labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Antiquaries can find no Nation, no City, no
Church, nor Houſes under any other, that our firſt Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall
Authors tell us, that the Apoſtles not only
allowed but founded Biſhops, ſo that the tradition for
ſome books of Scripture which we receive as Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall,
is both leſſe ancient, leſſe generall, and leſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contradicted,
I muſt ask leave to ſay, that though the
myſtery of iniquity began ſuddenly to worke, yet it
did not inſtantly prevaile, it could not ayme at the end
of the race, as ſoon as it was ſtarted, nor could Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianiſme
in ſo ſhort a time have become ſo Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:64029:3"/>
To the ſecond, this I ſay, that in this government
there is no <hi>inconvenience</hi> which might not be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
remedied without deſtroying the whole, and
though we had not paird their nailes, or rather their
Tongues, I mean the High-Commiſſion, though we
ſhould neither give them the direction of ſtrict rules,
nor the addition of choyce Aſſiſters (both which we
may doe and ſuddenly I hope we ſhall) yet the feare
ſunk into them of this Parliament, and the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Trienniall one, would be ſuch bankes to theſe
rivers, that we need feare their inundations no more.</p>
            <p>Next I ſay, that if ſome inconvenience did appeare
in this, yet ſince it may alſo appeare that the change
will breed greater, I deſire thoſe who are led to change
by inconveniences only, that they will ſuſpend their
opinions, till they ſee what is to be laid in the other
ballance, which I will endeavour.</p>
            <p>The inconveniences of the change are double, ſome
that it ſhould be yet done, others that it ſhould be at
all done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the firſt again double, becauſe we have not
done what we ſhould doe firſt, and becauſe others
have not done what they ſhould doe firſt. That which
we ſhould doe firſt, is to agree of a ſucceeding Forme
of Government, that every man, when he gives his
Vote to the deſtruction of this, may be ſure that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyes
not that which he likes better then that which
ſhall ſucceed it. I conceive no man will at this time
give this Vote, who doth not believe this Government
to be the worſt that can poſſibly be deviſed; and for my
part if this be thus prepoſterouſly done, and we left in
this blind uncertainty, what ſhall become of us, I ſhall
not only doubt all the inconveniences which any Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64029:3"/>
hath, but which any Government may have.
This I inſiſt on the rather, becauſe if we ſhould find
cauſe to wiſh for this back again we could not have
it, the means being diſperſt, to reſtore it again would
be a miracle in State, like that of the reſurrection to
Nature.</p>
            <p>That which others ſhould do firſt, is, to be gone.
For if you will do this, yet things ſtanding as they do,
no great cauſe appearing for ſo great a change, I feare
a great Army may be thought to be the cauſe, and I
therefore deſire (to be ſure that <hi>Newcastle</hi> may not be
ſuſpected to have any influence upon <hi>London</hi>) that this
may not be done till our Brethren be returned to their
Patrimony.</p>
            <p>We are now paſt the inconveniences in poynt of
time, I now proceed, and my firſt inconvenience of
this change is the inconvenience of change it ſelfe,
which is ſo great an inconvenience, when the change
is great and ſuddain, that in ſuch caſes, when it is not
neceſſary to change, it is neceſſary not to change. To
a perſon formerly intemperate I have known the firſt
preſcription of an excellent Phyſitian to forbeare too
good a diet for a good while. We have lived long
happily and gloriouſly under this Forme of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
it hath very well agreed with the conſtitution of
our Lawes, with the diſpoſition of our People, how
any other will doe, I the leſſe know, becauſe I know
not of any other, of which ſo much as any other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
hath had any experience, they all having (as I
conceive) at leaſt Superintendents for life, and the
meer word Biſhop, I ſuppoſe, is no mans aime to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy,
nor no mans aime to defend.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64029:4"/>
Next, Sir, I am of opinion, that moſt men deſire not
this change, or elſe I am certain there hath been very
ſuddenly a great change in men; ſeverall Petitions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
deſire it, but knowing how concern'd and how u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
that party is, how few would be wanting to ſo
good a worke, even thoſe hands which values their
number to others, are an argument of their paucity to
me. The numberleſſe number of thoſe of a different
ſenſe appeare not ſo publiquely and cry not ſo loud,
being perſons more quiet, as ſecure in the goodneſſe of
their Lawes, and the wiſdome of their Law-makers,
and becauſe men Petition for what they have not, and
not for what they have, perhaps that the Biſhops may
not know how many friends their Order hath, leaſt
they be incouraged to abuſe their authority, if they
knew it to be ſo generally approved. Now, Sir, though
we are truſted by thoſe that ſent us, in caſes wherein
their opinions were unknown, yet truly if I knew the
opinion of the major part of my Town, I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were the intention of thoſe that truſted me, that
I ſhould follow my own opinion againſt theirs, at leaſt
let us ſtay till the next Seſſion, and conſult more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
with them about it.</p>
            <p>Next, Sir, it will be the deſtruction of many eſtates,
in which many, who may be very innocent perſons,
are legally veſted, and of many perſons who undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly
are innocent, whoſe dependances are upon thoſe
eſtates; the Apoſtle ſaith, he that provides not for his
family, is worſe then an infidell, this belongs in ſome
analogy to us, and truly, Sir, we provide ill for our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
the Common-wealth, if we ſuffer a conſiderable
part of it to be turned out of doores, ſo that, for any
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64029:4"/>
care is taken by this bill for new dwelling, (and I will
never conſent they ſhall play an after game for all they
have) either we muſt ſee them ſtarve in the ſtreets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us, or to avoid that, muſt ſhip them ſome whether
away like the Moores out of Spaine.</p>
            <p>From the hurt of the Learned I come to that of
Learning, and deſire you to conſider, whether when
all conſiderable maintenance ſhall be reduced to cure
of ſoules, all ſtudies will not be reduced to thoſe
which are in order to Preaching; the Arts and Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and even eminent skill in Controverſies, to which
great leaſure and great meanes is required, much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
and to the joy and gain of our common adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
Syntagmes, Poſtylles, Catechiſmes, Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators,
and Concordances almoſt only bought, and the
reſt of Libraries remain rather as of ornament, then as
of uſe. I doe not deny but for all this want, the wit
of ſome hath attempted both, and the parts of ſome
few have ſerved to diſcharge both, and thoſe of <hi>Calvin</hi>
to adviſe about and diſpatch more Temporall buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
into the bargain, then all our Privy-Councell.
yet ſuch abilities are extreamly rare, and very few will
ever Preach twice a Sunday and be any match for
<hi>Bellarmine;</hi> nay I feare, Sir, that this will make us to
have ſewer able even in Preaching it ſelfe, as it is ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
from generall Learning, for I feare many whoſe
parts, friends and meanes, might make them hope
for better advancements in other courſes, when theſe
ſhall be taken away from this, will be leſſe ready to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
it; and though it were to be wiſht, that all men
ſhould only undertake thoſe Embaflages with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64029:5"/>
to his honour whoſe Embaſſadors they are; yet
I doubt not but many who have entred into the
Church by the Doore, or rather by the Window, have
done it after great and ſincere ſervice, and better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
have made them labour in the vineyard then
brought them thither at firſt; and though the meer
love of God ought to make us good, though there
were no reward or puniſhment, yet it would be very
inconvenient to piety, that hope of Heaven and feare
of Hell were taken away.</p>
            <p>My next inconvenience I feare, is this, that if we
ſhould take away a Government which hath as much
teſtimony of the firſt antiquity to have been founded
by the Apoſtles, as can be brought for ſome parts of
Scripture to have been written by them, leaſt this
may avert ſome of our Church from us, and rivit ſome
of the Roman Church to her; and as I remember, the
Apoſtle commands us to be carefull not to give ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall
even to thoſe that are without. Sir, it hath been
ſaid, that we have a better way to know Scripture then
by Tradition. I diſpute not this, Sir, but I know that
Tradition is the only argument to prove Scripture to
another, and the firſt to every mans ſelfe, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to the Samaritan Womans report, which made
many firſt believe in Chriſt, though they after belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
him for himſelfe, and I therefore would not
have this ſo farre weakned to us, as to take away E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy
as unlawfull, which is ſo farre by Tradition
proved to be lawfull.</p>
            <p>My next inconvenience that I feare, is this, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
obſerved thoſe generally who are againſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64029:5"/>
(I will not now ſpeak of ſuch as are among us,
who by being ſelected from the reſt are to be hoped
to be freer then ordinary from vulgar paſſions) to
have ſomewhat more animoſity againſt thoſe who
are for them, then <hi>vice verſâ;</hi> leaſt when they ſhall
have prevailed againſt the Biſhops, they be ſo farre en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
againſt their partakers, &amp; will ſo have diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
their adverſaries, as in time to induce a neceſſity
upon others at leaſt of the Clergy to beleive them as
unlawfull as they themſelves doe, and to aſſent to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of their opinions yet left at large: which will be a
way to deprive us I think of not our worſt, I am ſure
of our moſt learned Miniſters, and to ſend a greater
Colonie to <hi>New England,</hi> then it hath been ſaid this
Bill will recall from thence.</p>
            <p>I come now from the inconveniences of taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
this Government to the inconveniences of that
which ſhall ſucceed it: and to this I can ſpeake but by
gueſſe, and groping, becauſe I have no light given me
what that ſhall be; onely I hope I ſhall be excuſed for
ſhooting at randome, ſince you will ſet me up no Butt
to ſhoot at. The firſt I feare the Scotch Government
will either preſently be taken, or if any other ſucceed
for a while, yet the unity and induſtry of thoſe of that
opinion in this Nation, aſſiſted by the counſell and
friendſhip of that, will ſhortly bring it in, if any leſſe
oppoſite Government to it be here placed then that of
Epiſcopacy. And indeed, Sir, ſince any other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
then theirs will by no meanes give any ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to their deſire of uniformity; ſince all they who
ſee not the diſhonour and ill conſequences of it, will
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64029:6"/>
be unwilling to deny their Brethren what they eſteeme
indifferent ſince our owne Government being deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
we ſhall in all likelyhood be apteſt to receive that
which is both next at hand and ready made: For theſe
reaſons I look upon it as probable; and for the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ones, as inconvenient.</p>
            <p>When ſome Biſhops pretended to <hi>Iure divino</hi>
(though nothing ſo likely to be beleived by the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
as theſe would be, nor conſequently to hurt us by
that pretence) this was cry'd out upon as deſtructive
to His Majeſties Supremacy, who was to be confeſſed
to be the fountaine of jurisdiction in this Kingdome.
Yet to <hi>Iure divino</hi> that Eccleſiaſticall government pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends,
to meet when they pleaſe, to Treat of what they
pleaſe, to excommunicate whom they pleaſe, even Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments
themſelves: ſo farre are they from receiving
either rules or puniſhments from them. And for us to
bring in any unlimited, any independent authority, the
firſt is againſt the Liberty of the Subject, the ſecond
againſt the Right and Priviledge of Parliament, and
both againſt the Proteſtation.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, that this unlimitedneſſe and independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is onely in ſpirituall things, I firſt anſwer that ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
government beeing the worſt of governments,
and our bodies being worſe then our ſoules, it will be
ſtrang to ſet up that over the ſecond, of which we were
ſo impatient over the firſt. Secondly, that M. <hi>Sollicitor</hi>
ſpeaking about the Power of the Clergy to make Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons

almoſt all the other. And to this I may adde,
what all men may ſee, the vaſt Temporall power of
the Pope allow'd him by ſuch who allow it him only

Foxes, leaſt he might call a knubbe a horne. And ſure
Sir, they will in this caſe be judges, not only of that
which is ſpirituall, but of what it is that is ſo: and the
people receiving inſtruction from no other, will take
the moſt Temporall matter to be Spirituall, if they
tell them it is ſo.</p>
