         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Noble Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>GOd having raiſed me up from the power of the
grave, though he hath not made known to me
yet, what further uſe he hath of me, but I wait on him
whom I have found to be my God, both in ſickneſs and
health. Sir, at preſent I am preſt in ſpirit to write to you,
&amp; I yet know no other but it is from the Spirit of God.
There is a mighty noiſe of unrighteouſneſſe and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
in the proceedings at your Councels as to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
And truly Sir, this not in moſt Counties onely
amongſt the people, but amongſt the choiceſt, and the
conſcientious Chriſtians: the hearts of good people are
departed from you very much, and from your Army
and Counſells: And Sir, whatſoever you or others may
think and perſwade your ſelves, yet I am thus free to
ſpeak, that God hath at preſent brought a dark cloud o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
you, and the Lord ſhew you a way out of it, which
is preſented to mee to bee this onely way, ſtop not the
breathings of God in meane private Chriſtians; the
counſells of God flow there, when the greater perſons
ſomtimes (for his glory) are left naked without a word
of advice from him. I found this deſolating evill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
in your meetings. Be faithfull to your ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for Juſtice to the Kingdome: you have many, and
you promiſed ſpeedy redreſſe of many things. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:165291:3"/>
and compare in the light of God impartially, how
your firſt principles, and publike promiſes and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
anſwer each other: and where you have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous,
delatory, or unfaithfull, be not diſcouraged
ſpeedily to depart out of thoſe tents, leaſt God over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
you with a diſpenſation of more righteouſneſſe, and
judge you.</p>
            <p>Sir, the cries, the teares, the prayers of the oppreſſed
and afflicted, and the departing of many of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in their hearts from you, are and will b<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

ſtones, and cups of trembling. The Lord direct you in
this your day, that you may not depart from your firſt
love, leſt he who is the holy One, the juſt One, the
God bleſſed for ever, come againſt you with the ſpirit
of his mouth. Sir, I have little more to write, the Lord
having diſcharged me of this burden, which was as fire
in my bones: And truly the ſhadowes that ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells
of the fleſh have brought upon this Army lately,
hath reached to the darkening of all profeſſing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in the Kingdome, in the hearts of the people of the
Kingdome: for, where ſhould redreſſe come (will they
think) if not from ſuch as profeſſe higher godlineſſe then

            <p>I Have found the Lord appearing of late in my weak
eſtate, and I cannot but from theſe ſweet ſhinings
of his deſire, to behold the like and more glorious
in thoſe who are called to greater actions. Sir, it is the
voice of people, but that which ſounds loudeſt is the
voice of choice, and ſpirituall deſiring Chriſtians, that
your proceedings have much injuſtice, great delayes,
and the hearts of many good people are turning from
you, as you are in theſe wayes, you are much accuſed of
unfaithfulneſſe to ſolemn Ingagements: Sir, I was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
long ſince, you may remember, to tell you what
would follow in ſtopping the breathings of God in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
and poor Chriſtians, and I muſt tell you, and I
know other, but it is the voice of the Lord in me, that
I obſerve you and ſome others to begin an eſtrangement
to ſuch who were godly, honeſt and ſpirituall, and to
avoid diſcourſe and communion with them: Me thinks
I ſee in the light of God a black cloud over ſome of
you in the Army, and I am ſatisfied in ſpirit, that there
are great tranſgreſſions amongſt you againſt publike Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
and Righteouſneſſe; behold, and you ſhall ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

were daſhed, and truly Sir, by what I ſee in your
proceeding, and heare of your Councells by honeſt
men, ſome of ye haſten in the fleſh to the ſame diſtreſſe.
Sir, break off this ſin by righteouſneſs, return to your
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:165291:4"/>
communion with Chriſtians, let not the wiſdom of the
fleſh intice you under the diſguiſe of Chriſtian prudence,
for that wiſdome is not from above which is not pure
and eaſie to be intreated; run not to the old ſhifts of
the fleſh in theſe your times of ſtraight, leane not on
Aegypt, or any imaginary ſtrength which is not of God,
if the Lord in his goodneſs and wiſdom will have ſome
of your former glory which was his, and you might
through temptation think your own, to periſh: be not
aſhamed of the fiery triall, but cloſe in with that which
hath moſt of God in it, do you not hear an oppreſſed
and afflicted Kingdome crying out to ye? believe it Sir,
all profeſſing Chriſtians in all places will ſuffer what
evill is done by ye, the Lord ſhew you wherein you
have counſelled in fleſh, neglected Chriſtians, delayed
Juſtice, failed in publike Ingagements, neglected or
grieved ſome afflicted Chriſtians whom you ſhould
have comforted, and then peace, glory, and excellent
power will appear in you, and Chriſtians will bleſſe
God in you, whilſt you walk in that more pure admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration:
and Sir know, that you in your perſon will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy

God powres out freſh abilities freely and of meer grace,
even rivers and ſtreams of life in ſuch weake veſſells of

firſt put upon ye, by an Almighty Power, and
which carried you on upon a conquering wing: the
wiſdome of the fleſh hath deceived and enticed, and that

what you muſt do; I know it is unſavoury to nature to
be accuſed or taxed, but I hope there will be found that
Spirit in you, that will eſteem the wounds of a friend
better then the kiſſes of an enemy. I write I know to
ſuch who in their firſt love were a people loving God,
and his appearances in the meaneſt Chriſtian, and ſuch
as purſued the good and happineſſe of the Kingdome
cordially: and if the Lord hath not thought to take off
the Spirit of righteouſneſſe from ye, and put it upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
people, he will give you to diſcerne this laſt
temptation wherein Sathan hath deſired to winnow ye,
and ye ſhall be a Diadem once more in the hands of the
Lord: For my ſelf, as I am my ſelf, there is neither wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
nor counſell in me, but if the Lord hath breathed
on my weakneſſe for your ſakes, I ſhall rejoyce in that
mercy and grace of his. I reſt,</p>
