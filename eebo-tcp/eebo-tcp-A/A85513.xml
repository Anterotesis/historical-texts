            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Grand
Caſe of Conſcience
Concerning the
ENGAGEMENT
Stated and Reſolved.</head>
            <p>AS there is no <hi>Engagement</hi> on man more ſacred and ſolemn,
then that which is contracted by <hi>Oaths and Covenants,
(God</hi> himſelf being expreſly appealed unto, both as Witneſs
and Judg;) ſo there is nothing more dangerous and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnaring,
if not warily and honeſtly entred into, and kept, as well with
a clear and ſound judgment, as with pure and chryſtal affections. The
truth of this is evidently demonſtrated in the late <hi>League and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
between theſe two Nations, <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it wanted nothing of Ceremony and Solemnity in its admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
yet hath proved ſad and ominous in the uſe and application
of it unto this Common-wealth: And though it was firſt intended as
the beſt and moſt proper <hi>medium</hi> of union and ſtrength to both Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
againſt the common Enemy, yet hath proved (in ſeveral hands) a
<hi>ſtratagem</hi> to obſtruct the moſt prudential and providential eſſays of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:165508:3"/>
perfecting the Peace and Happineſs of both; yea, is onely left as the
laſt reſerve and ultimate plea of all ſorts of diſ-affected and abuſed ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
who having (with little effect) made uſe of all ſort of weapons,
would by it make us miſerable, by our own Conſciences.</p>
            <p>It is not now time to look back, when this <hi>Covenant</hi> was made,
and where, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Scotland;</hi> or upon what occaſion it was entred
into at firſt: I have ſo much charity to think there was on all ſides
good and honeſt intentions active in the modelling of it, though ſome
had their eyes in their heads, and many objections were made at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
expreſſions, and many deſires for explanation of ſome Articles
more fully; yet it was not fit to inſiſt on them, our affairs not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any delay in our Brethrens aſſiſtance, nor their conjunction to be
obtained without a Covenant, though the cauſe was common to both.
But after it paſt the gulf, and was taken by the <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of Divines,</hi> and honeſt men of all ſorts had freely lifted up their
hands to God in it (not fearing the after-reckoning would be ſo coſtly
and dangerous) every one began to make his advantage (through the
multitude and ambiguity of expreſſion, moſt unſuitable to a <hi>Covenant,</hi>
which ought to be plain and ſimple in its terms) and by it to promote
his ſeveral intereſt; as if it had been made to engage unto a particular
party, not to unite two Nations in a common Intereſt: Yea, ſo many
ſeveral interpretations, variety of ſences, have been fixt upon it, as if
it were intended rather for Debates then Obedience, and to exerciſe
mens wits, rather then enforce their Conſciences to honeſt and neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
duties; yea (which we may remember with ſad hearts) <hi>England</hi>
never knew what it was to have ſo many ſad diviſions of parties and
intereſts, until the <hi>Covenant</hi> came, by the deſign of ſome diſguiſed
Politicians to be improved to ſome particular Intereſts and Parties,
who inſiſting ſome on one Article, and ſome on another, in oppoſition
to the reſt, as they ſaw their advantage, have divided the <hi>Covenant</hi>
into ſeveral parts (to engage ſeveral parties;) others have made one
and the ſame Article to ſpeak ſeveral Senſes, dividing the ſence from
the words, torturing the very Comma's and Colons, making a ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
between them and the words, which they neceſſarily diſtinguiſh,
and all but to ſtrengthen their own Intereſt, and deſtroy anothers; that
the abuſes do ſeem to be worſe, and more heinous, then the breach of
it would be.</p>
            <p>The firſt and main advantage that was made of it was to ſet up the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:165508:3"/>
               <hi>Preſbyterial Government</hi> in <hi>ENGLAND,</hi> without any bound
or limitation of the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate;</hi> and the <hi>Scots</hi> (who beſt
knew the deſign of the <hi>Covenant)</hi> urge their pattern firſt, as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
their Church to be the beſt Reformed: and ſo ſtrongly and
vigorouſly was it managed, that they got ſo far on the affections of
the people by ſuch pleas, that the brand of <hi>Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Schiſm,</hi> in
the firſt Article, was faſtened on all thoſe that differed or diſſented
in Diſcipline from that pattern; and ſo far on Authority, that
none ſhould either preach, or be fit for any place in Government of
<hi>State,</hi> but he that ſubſcribed to that ſence; That moderate and wary
ſpirits, (which through Reaſon and Conſcience differed onely in
theſe circumſtances) had nothing to relieve themſelves by, and avoyd
the direful ſentence of perjury, layd on them, for not bringing up
their Congregations to the <hi>Preſbyterial Model,</hi> but onely that clauſe
which was (happily inſerted) <hi>[According to the Word of GOD;]</hi>
But to ſalve that, and preſs on the former Intereſt, the Reformed
Churches were brought in (and not onely <hi>Scotland</hi> propoſed) as the
main and abſolute Rule, and the Word of God to be exegetical
and expoſitory, virtually included in them: and ſo vehemently hath
this firſt Article been preſt to that Intereſt, that all union beſides, and
agreement in Doctrine, and the abſolutes and neceſſaries of Religion
have been accounted of as low and ordinary, in compariſon of it,
that moſt men have thought it was a deſign either to make men doubt
that there is any Church-Government <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> or elſe that any
will ſerve the turn, which is but popular, and ſuitable to a preſent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt.</p>
            <p>And of ſuch a fundamental conſequence hath the <hi>Covenant</hi> bin judged
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that they uſed it as the characteriſtical difference of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
both in Church and State, and looked on it as the beſt conſtituting
principle of Saint-ſhip and holineſs, and the viſible qualification of
members of Churches, and as the onely way of admiſſion at firſt, or
re-admiſſion on relapſe; for when in the firſt expedition many had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted
from them to the common Enemy, and were excommunicated,
both whole Shires and Pariſhes, It was put unto the queſtion in the
General Aſſembly, What way ſhould be taken for the Tryal of
their <hi>REPENTANCE,</hi> and to receive them in again? It
was abſolutely carryed by Vote, by a new taking of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:165508:4"/>
And that there might be no further difference between <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Scotland,</hi> it was often urged, that by it we might be made one King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and no more be diſtinct in Priviledg, ſeeing we were all one by
<hi>Covenant,</hi> that the name of great <hi>Britain</hi> might contain us all, yea by
the <hi>Covenant</hi> our brethren challenged a Priviledg in framing our own
<hi>Propoſitions</hi> for our <hi>own ſafety,</hi> and to determine what we ſhould <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,</hi>
and what not, with the Order and method of them, and a mutual
diſpoſal of the <hi>Offices, and Officers,</hi> with the reſt of our affairs, claiming
an equal ſhare in all our <hi>Priviledges,</hi> and the management of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
it ſelf.</p>
            <p>The next, and more ſpecial uſe of it, was to further a <hi>Perſonal Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
wherein the <hi>Scots Commiſſioners</hi> had the principal hand, as being
moſt privy to the firſt intention of its compiling: For when the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of the firſt <hi>Article</hi> was out of credit, and the diſguiſe of it
pluckt off by that expreſſion, <hi>The word of God,</hi> that the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical
mediums</hi> would not ſerve the turn, they fall on another <hi>Article,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they finde but only a bare mention of the Kings Perſon, (charitably,
and yet limitedly inſerted) and propoſe, and preſs the Parliament upon
pain of perjury, and without any reſerve, unto a <hi>Perſonal Treaty,</hi> wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſafe and beſt reſolv'd on way of Treating by poſitive, and Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
<hi>Propoſitions:</hi> And ſo eager and fierce were they on it, that
the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> in the name of the reſt, in that notable <hi>Remonſtrance</hi>
of theirs for a <hi>Perſonal Treaty,</hi> quoted the name of the <hi>Covenant</hi> more
then Twenty times in one Page, and tax the Parliament with <hi>breach of
Covenant,</hi> but for omitting a ſuppoſed method, not placing of it in
that order in the <hi>Propoſitions</hi> which they thought moſt fit, urging ſtill
no way of fulfilling the <hi>Covenant</hi> but by <hi>Perſonal Treaty,</hi> forgetting
all the reſt of the <hi>Articles</hi> that ſpeak of <hi>Religion, a Common Enemy,
the Priviledges of Parliament, of bringing Delinquents to Juſtice,</hi> and
ſo <hi>procuring Liberty;</hi> but theſe were firſt in intention, and muſt be laſt
in execution.</p>
            <p>The next party that entered the ſtage with the <hi>Covenant</hi> in their
hands, was the old <hi>Malignant</hi> and <hi>Common Enemy</hi> (who waited on
our trifling <hi>Tranſactions)</hi> who ſeeing what uſe was made of it by the
<hi>Scots Preſbyterian Party,</hi> and how nigh the <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
had driven it to their intereſt, emprove all their former <hi>Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with the Parliament,</hi> and on that ſtock graff a deſign of a new and
bloody <hi>War,</hi> and the ſcean being changed from <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Scotland,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:165508:4"/>
Duke <hi>Hamilton</hi> (having got the major Vote in the Parliament) Levies
an Army of <hi>Scots,</hi> who joyning with Sir <hi>Marmaduke Langdale,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
deſperate Engliſh <hi>Malignants,</hi> enter <hi>England</hi> with a great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
ſeconding the <hi>Commiſſioners Remonſtrances,</hi> uſing their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
in their Declarations, holding forth the <hi>Covenant</hi> as their <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne</hi>
both of <hi>honeſty,</hi> and hopes of <hi>Victory,</hi> profeſſing to be moved to
that expedition by nothing but the <hi>Covenant;</hi> and for more effectual
proſecution of the ends of it in a <hi>Perſonal Treaty,</hi> to ſuppreſs <hi>Hereſies,</hi>
and <hi>Schiſmes,</hi> and ſettle the affairs of the <hi>Church in greater ſecurity,
and beauty, free from Error</hi> or <hi>Faction:</hi> Thus the <hi>Covenant</hi> was
uſed, (and in as good words) to maintain the <hi>Malignant intereſt,</hi> and
to unite the <hi>Common Enemy</hi> both in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> which was
intended againſt both; and though many of the <hi>Kirk</hi> diſclaimed theſe
proceedings, and ſaw the diſguiſe rather in the <hi>Perſons,</hi> then the <hi>things,</hi>
yet they profeſt, and acted no more above board, then their own <hi>Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates</hi>
had beforehand with publique approbation by them, and intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are only known unto God.</p>
            <p>Thus hath this <hi>Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> which our Brethren
and others may well call <hi>Sacred,</hi> and the moſt ſure engagement between
creatures in this world, been by every hand made common, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane,
raviſhed by the intereſt and ends of ſiniſter and ſelf-iſh Spirits;
toſt up and down, and turnd, as a noſe of wax, into the form of every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign;
yea, ſo abuſed and rent one part from the other, the <hi>Means</hi> from
the <hi>End,</hi> and one Article from another, that it ſeems to have no more
ſubſtance left intire, then what you find preſerv'd in the <hi>Stationers ſhop</hi>
by a true impreſſion, or in the <hi>Churches,</hi> and <hi>Publique places,</hi> by the
careful hands of the <hi>Wardens</hi> kept untorn; nor any more <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Life</hi>
in it to bind a mans Conſcience, then only what the <hi>diſaffected Spirits</hi>
of ſome perſons have of late breath'd into it.</p>
            <p>But the laſt and worſt abuſe of it (which may well be put down <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtar
omnium)</hi> is, That it is now ſent forth as a Bull, to denounce the
<hi>Dreadful ſentence of perjury on the Parliament, and High Court of
Juſtice,</hi> for taking away the Kings perſon, and as the great obſtruction,
and plea againſt compliance with this preſent <hi>Government of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth;</hi>
and is ſo ordered in this laſt uſe, That when through the
glorious actings of <hi>Providence</hi> we have eſcaped the <hi>Common ſnare,</hi> we
muſt by our own <hi>Conſciences</hi> be made <hi>Religiouſly miſerable:</hi> And
how ſad muſt it needs be to all honeſt hearts, That the <hi>Covenant</hi> which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:165508:5"/>
was at firſt intended as the moſt adaequate means of peace and happineſs
to theſe two <hi>Nations,</hi> ſhould at laſt be formed into an <hi>Engine of diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
and the greateſt and only <hi>Impediment</hi> to a compleat <hi>Setlement of
Peace,</hi> and adminiſtred as the laſt Cordial to revive the loſt hopes of our
<hi>dying Enemies?</hi> And after we have (through God) ſtruck out all the
<hi>Carnal weapons</hi> out of their hands, yea, ſeparated the <hi>Head from that
great body,</hi> we ſhould furniſh them with refined and <hi>Spiritual Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
and having caſt off their <hi>chains,</hi> ſhould bind our ſelves by the <hi>wriths
of Circumſtantial,</hi> and ſuppoſed <hi>Ingagements.</hi> What are now the eryes
and <hi>Lamentations in prayers,</hi> and <hi>Pulpits,</hi> but the breach of <hi>The So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
League and Covenant?</hi> all the diſcontents, Animoſities, diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences
to <hi>Authority,</hi> take their Sanctuary in the <hi>Covenant;</hi> there
they are maintained and live, and at length are reſolv'd into this <hi>Grand
caſe</hi> of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> viz:</p>
            <p>Whether we may without perjury ſubmit to the Government of a
Common-wealth, and take the new Ingagement enjoyned by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
ſeeing they have taken away the Kings Perſon whom we Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted
to preſerve, and have altered the Government, all which is
contrary to our former ingagements in the Covenant?</p>
            <p>Though this be an old way uſed by moſt men to countenance their
diſlike of preſent duties, by flying to <hi>conſcience,</hi> &amp; <hi>urging former ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
as the <hi>Malignants</hi> did againſt the firſt <hi>Proteſtation,</hi> and of late
againſt the <hi>Covenant,</hi> preſſing their former <hi>Ingagements</hi> by the Oathes
of <hi>Supremacy and Allegeance:</hi> Yet becauſe it is the utmoſt, and laſt
Plea that can be made againſt this <hi>Government,</hi> and that honeſt and
<hi>Conſciencious men</hi> (with whom I only deſire to deale in this diſcourſe)
may ſee what a weak <hi>Foundation</hi> they build their <hi>diſaffections</hi> on, and
how little reaſon they have to ſtand off from obedience to this preſent
happy ſetled Authority, notwithſtanding all that they have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
bound unto by <hi>The Solemn League and Covenant,</hi> I ſhall offer
to their view theſe following conſiderations about the nature of <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations
by Oathes and Covenants,</hi> the ignorance or miſtake of which,
is the cauſe that men either bind themſelves to what they ſhould not, or
elſe look on themſelves as bound when they are free.</p>
            <p>An <hi>Obligation</hi> is nothing elſe but a bond or tye on men, to do or
omit any act, the force of which is to contract and fix the ſtrength of
mens abilities to ſome certain object, and manner of acting, or utterly to
reſtrain and keep in that power from the doing of any ſuch act which
is <hi>unſutable and contrary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:165508:5"/>
The moſt uſual diſtinctions of ſuch <hi>Obligations,</hi> are by <hi>Promiſes,
Oathes, and Covenants,</hi> which do not differ in their nature, but in the
<hi>Solemnity</hi> of <hi>expreſſion;</hi> a promiſe bindes as well as an Oath, but the
one bindes with more <hi>Religious ceremony,</hi> an <hi>Oath</hi> being a <hi>Religious
Act</hi> whereby we bind our ſelves to the doing, or omitting any Act,
<hi>Deo teſte, &amp; vindice, Gods name being invocated to judge and revenge,
if there be any guil in the intentions, or willing defect in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;</hi>
and the ſame is implicitely in every promiſe; for what I promiſe I
mean to perform as in the preſence of God; and my Conſcience as <hi>Gods
Vicegerent,</hi> takes Record of the Act as if it had been expreſt; only an
<hi>Oath</hi> by its publique and Solemn addition of Gods name, doth more
fix the <hi>Obligation</hi> on the heart, and makes men more careful out of fear
of puniſhment to perform.</p>
            <p>But as in all Acts which are imployed about any Object, there is a
preſuppoſal of ſome formal reaſon, which is the ground of the Act, and
unto which the Act muſt neceſſarily and <hi>ſutably anſwer;</hi> ſo much more
<hi>in Obligations,</hi> by any <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Religious Act</hi> (wherein the beſt of
our underſtandings and hearts ſhould be imployed) muſt there be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſed
ſome fundamental <hi>Conſideration</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> which gives
life and power to any ſuch <hi>Engagement</hi> for which a man doth engage
himſelf: Elſe no man can act <hi>Rationally,</hi> or <hi>Honeſtly,</hi> or ſwear in
<hi>judgement</hi> or <hi>truth,</hi> nor perform <hi>in righteouſneſs</hi> the three abſolute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites
to the <hi>Obligation</hi> of any <hi>Promiſe</hi> or <hi>Oath.</hi> Therefore there can
be no <hi>Obligation</hi> to what is in it ſelf ſinful or unlawful, or what is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to be done, becauſe there is no reaſon to bind a man to it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can that be the <hi>Object</hi> of <hi>Obligation</hi> which God hath forbidden,
or hath not given ability to perform, or what may croſs any moral or
abſolute good.</p>
            <p>And theſe formal <hi>reaſons</hi> or <hi>conditions,</hi> are either ſo in regard of the
<hi>Objects,</hi> as flowing from the nature of the things themſelves to be
done, and ſo are eſſentially annexed to them, that they are abſolutely
<hi>Independent</hi> from any <hi>Human will</hi> or <hi>power</hi> to alter and change them,
or diſingage men lawfully from them.</p>
            <p>Or elſe theſe reaſons are not ſimply and neceſſarily annexed to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the <hi>Object,</hi> but may be added at pleaſure, and no <hi>Obligation</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſeth
from the thing it ſelf until it be made by us.</p>
            <p>Of the Firſt ſort are all Divine <hi>Acts of Worſhip,</hi> and all the
<hi>Moral</hi> rules of <hi>Honeſty</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> which do binde for ever,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:165508:6"/>
and at firſt ſight, (no other reaſon intervening) but what they carry
in their own natures; therefore is not left to any humane power or arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trement,
whether they ſhall worſhip God, or in what form, and way,
whether men ſhould be temperate, and juſt, and honeſt, and do acts ſuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to theſe, the mention of them doth oblige all men to conform their
wills and practiſe to them, and yet oftentimes (to help our natural dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and indiſpoſition) we bind our ſelves again to theſe things we
were formerly and neceſſarily bound unto, that we may be more hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and careful in the performance of them, moſt men thinking they are
bound unto nothing ſo ſtrongly, but what they bind themſelves unto,
and by their own conſent ſtabliſh as a Law.</p>
            <p>But theſe <hi>Obligations</hi> which are of the latter ſort, do only depend
on our <hi>Wills,</hi> and <hi>Voluntary judgements,</hi> and are then <hi>Valid,</hi> when
the <hi>Object</hi> of them is <hi>good,</hi> and <hi>honeſt,</hi> and the <hi>Conditions</hi> on which
they are made be kept.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the <hi>Object,</hi> and matter of theſe <hi>Obligations,</hi> being <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
affairs,</hi> are changeable, and ſubject to ſeveral perplexities in the
mannagement, and under many caſualties (being rather intended as
<hi>Mediums</hi> to other good ends, then having any <hi>real excellency</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves)
no man can judiciouſly, as a <hi>prudent,</hi> and <hi>knowing man,</hi> bind
himſelf abſolutely, and ſwear to the performance of any ſuch thing for
the future; for the matter it ſelf is <hi>obnoxious</hi> to <hi>Providence,</hi> and to
be changed whether the perſon will or no; and that which is for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
neceſſary and convenient (in theſe things) are <hi>in materia contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genti,
for the future contingent,</hi> and hazardous afterwards, and the
<hi>Object</hi> is in its nature ſeparable from the <hi>Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as ſome things carry their reaſons with them, and need no act of
ours to ſtabliſh them in their Authority, and juſt <hi>Obligation;</hi> ſo other
things have their reaſon of <hi>Obligation</hi> from us, and are only <hi>binding,</hi> as
they are fit means to attain to more <hi>Fundamental</hi> and <hi>neceſſary ends,</hi>
and their reaſon lies in their conveniency, and proportion to <hi>moral</hi> and
<hi>honeſt effects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence it follows, That theſe ſpecial reaſons, or abſolute reſpects ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the <hi>obligation</hi> which is drawn from them wholy ceaſeth alſo, theſe
<hi>Principles</hi> being not only as <hi>Cauſa fine qua non,</hi> without which no man
would ingage, but conſtitutive principles of the goodneſs of the
<hi>action;</hi> for by the abſence of theſe, the whole <hi>Eſſence</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi>
of the thing is changed as in reſpect of <hi>Obligation,</hi> for there is
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:165508:6"/>
nothing left in the nature of the matter to oblige me to it, and the firſt
and only <hi>Reaſon</hi> that ingaged me is taken away, which doth not hold
the ſame in all <hi>circumſtances,</hi> which <hi>accidentally</hi> and <hi>occaſionally</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here:
For the deſtruction of them doth not alter the <hi>Nature</hi> of the
thing it ſelf; as he which takes away the <hi>Rational ſoul</hi> deſtroys the
<hi>Man,</hi> but not he that takes away his <hi>Beauty,</hi> or acquired learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>It is therefore apparent, and undeniable, That in all <hi>Obligations</hi>
there muſt be ſome <hi>conditions</hi> either <hi>puctually</hi> expreſt, or <hi>tacitely</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd,
which are as firſt motives to <hi>actions,</hi> and the only ground for
which they are to be <hi>Acted,</hi> and according to the terms, and reſpects
of which they are to be performed, which being either not kept, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
the <hi>Obligation</hi> is no more: for this <hi>Condition</hi> is ſo <hi>eſſential,</hi>
and ſo fixt in the heart of him which is <hi>ingaged,</hi> That if it be loſt, the
whole <hi>Foundation is overturn'd,</hi> and the man cannot act as a man, or
as a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> afterwards, notwithſtanding his <hi>verbal ingagement;</hi> and
take it whether <hi>tacitely, or expreſly,</hi> yet without ſuch a <hi>condition,</hi> no
man would ingage in ſuch an act; neither hath the man a mind to do it,
(other things conſidered) though he may have a full power of effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it.</p>
            <p>And therefore its concluded by the moſt <hi>Criticall Caſuiſts,</hi> That
if the thing alter and change from what it was in the eye when the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation</hi>
was made, the <hi>Obligation</hi> is alſo null; for that thing is not <hi>in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
natura</hi> which I <hi>ingaged</hi> my ſelf unto, or if it have a being, yet is
under another form, and ſhape, different from the firſt <hi>reaſon,</hi> and
<hi>ground</hi> of my <hi>Obligation;</hi> and no man can be <hi>obliged</hi> unto that which
he never thought of, or when he doth think of, <hi>abominates;</hi> therefore
its unlawful and moſt <hi>deregatory unto Reaſon,</hi> that any man ſhould
bind himſelf to all <hi>eaſes,</hi> and <hi>circumſtances,</hi> come what will come,
or notwithſtanding what ever may fall out; for in the moſt perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and <hi>abſolute obligations,</hi> wherein there is ſcarce a <hi>condition</hi> (through
<hi>love</hi> and <hi>modeſty)</hi> conceived, yet men are not bound to all <hi>emergencies,
caſualties, circumſtances,</hi> but only ſo long as the <hi>Special, and formal
reaſon</hi> remains intire, and whole, and only unto theſe caſes, unto which
the <hi>Foundation</hi> will extend. Thus ſome <hi>Obligations</hi> are made abſolute,
not becauſe there may not poſſible be an excepted caſe, but becauſe the
very mention, or ſuppoſal of the Condition, may create ſuſpicion, and
jealouſie, and ſeems to be ſo much againſt nature, that no <hi>ingenious,</hi> or
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:165508:7"/>
               <hi>modest heart</hi> will admit the thoughts of them, therefore they are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
omitted. As for example; Man promiſeth ſimply and without
<hi>condition,</hi> never to depart from his wife as long as he lives, which yet
contains a ſecret condition, <hi>if ſhe behave her ſelf as a wife;</hi> the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of which condition, that love and endearedneſs to her would not
admit, no not of the thought; and the very apprehenſion of it would be
a temptation, and moſt contrary to the unprejudiced and ſingle
thoughts of lovers, and moſt diſſonant to that <hi>ſimple</hi> &amp; <hi>individual union</hi>
between man, and wife; among whom there ſhould be but one Soul in
two Bodies, or one body acted by two <hi>united Spirits;</hi> and yet if any
wife ſhould <hi>commit Adultery,</hi> or ſeek to deſtroy her <hi>huſband,</hi> (things
that the <hi>pure and chaſt intentions of love</hi> durſt not ſuppoſe, yet may be
poſſible <hi>in corrupted nature)</hi> he is free from all other Obligations to
her, ſhe having <hi>unnaturally,</hi> and beyond expectation diſſolved the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
by deſtroying the main ends of <hi>marriage,</hi> which are <hi>communion,</hi> and
<hi>mutual comfort</hi> and preſervation; and ſo having acted contrary to the
<hi>Fundamental</hi> reaſon of that Obligation, hath <hi>ipſo facto</hi> put her ſelf into
another condition, and diſcharged by her own act, all former <hi>Ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
The like may be ſaid (as hereafter) between King and
people.</p>
            <p>Hence therefore its demonſtrative, that if any through ignorance, or
overactings of a deſign, ſhould not foreſeeing the nature of things, or
forecaſting events, ingage himſelf to two things imcompoſſible, or
which through any neceſſity of divine <hi>acting,</hi> or in the order of <hi>natural</hi>
and <hi>moral affairs,</hi> ſhould prove inconſiſtent by ſome ſpecial emergence;
he is bound to omit that which is leſs principal, and perform that which
is moſt poſitive, and neceſſary. As ſuppoſe one in taking the degree of
Doctor in the <hi>Popiſh Dominions,</hi> (as its uſed in the form of their
<hi>Oaths)</hi> doth ſolemnly bind himſelf <hi>to embrace the Doctrine of Chriſt,
and as much as in him lies, to promote the Doctrine of the Church of
Rome,</hi> which is really contrary to Chriſt; doth not ſound <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as
well as <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> teach us, That he is only bound to do the one, and
neglect the other? And though the thing we ſwear to perform, be not
in it ſelf unlawful; but <hi>magis bonum morale impediens, hindering a more
special good,</hi> as <hi>Grotius (lib. 2. de jure Belli, &amp; pacis, p.</hi> 245.) well
obſerves: the <hi>Obligation</hi> ceaſeth from that, and is neceſſarily contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on that which is moſt neceſſary and beſt to be done. If this were not
ſo, in the multiplicity of <hi>humane tranſactions</hi> moſt men would be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:165508:7"/>
bound only to one act, and ſo be kept from performance of all other
<hi>duties</hi> which did not depend on that, or were not <hi>Subordinate</hi> to it;
and by one <hi>ingagement</hi> (though it may be haſtily entered into) a man
muſt be for ever unuſeful in matters of higher, and more peculiar <hi>impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;</hi>
and have no remedy, no not of <hi>repentance</hi> and better thoughts for
his ſuddain ſurprizal.</p>
            <p>And as no man is bound thus to any thing leſs conſiderable, or oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to a Common and publique good, ſo neither can there be any <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi>
to any <hi>medium</hi> which any man hath bound himſelf unto, if by
that means he cannot moſt <hi>effectually obtain the principal end:</hi> as if the
<hi>Hebrews</hi> had by <hi>Covenant ingaged</hi> unto <hi>Pharoah,</hi> that they would uſe
no other <hi>mid-wifes</hi> but the <hi>Aegyptian women,</hi> the edict being proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>of killing all the Male children,</hi> they were diſobliged from any <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of obeying it,</hi> it being contrary to <hi>principles of nature,</hi> (which
muſt be firſt ſerved) whereby all men are taught to preſerve by the beſt
ways they can themſelves, and what is properly their own; and had
they kept ſuch an <hi>ingagement,</hi> they had been not only <hi>witneſſes</hi> of, but
<hi>legal completters</hi> in the murther of their own children.</p>
            <p>By all this we ſee as it falls out many times, That even <hi>Scelus eſt ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
the very ſwearing is ſin,</hi> as <hi>Seneca (lib.</hi> 2.) expreſſeth it; ſo as
<hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith <hi>(off. 1. c. ult.) eſt contra officium nonnunquam ſolvere
promiſſum, juramentum cuſtodire, it's ſometimes againſt a mans duty
to keep his promiſe, or perform his Oath;</hi> and in the moſt ſolemn <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements</hi>
(eſpecially about <hi>temporary,</hi> and <hi>controvertible</hi> things:) the
firſt grounds and reaſons muſt be moſt weighed, (omitting preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice,
and accidents) and what is moſt poſitive, and humane, inſiſted on,
and adhered unto.</p>
            <p>By all this I may ſeem but to waſte paper, and take up time, but I hope
the application will make amends for the defects in the doctrine: have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
laid this <hi>general foundation,</hi> let us now come particularly to ſee
how far we are ingaged by this <hi>Covenant</hi> unto the Kings Perſon,
and his Poſterity, and <hi>Monarchichal Government</hi> in them, and how
far we are free and diſingaged from them, and at <hi>liberty</hi> to imbrace any
other form of <hi>Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this purpoſe let us as warily view the <hi>Covenant,</hi> as we have
done the nature of <hi>Obligation,</hi> and conſider the matter, and ends
of it, and we ſhall finde in the Preface and Contents theſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Reaſons poſitively expreſt, The honour of God, the ſafety of the two
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:165508:8"/>
Nations in the <hi>preſervation</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> which were firſt in
the eye of the impoſers, and the <hi>golden apples</hi> caſt before us, to <hi>allure</hi> us
unto the <hi>ingagement,</hi> and are as the <hi>vital spirits</hi> that run through e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<hi>vain</hi> of it, without which it were but an unneceſſary and <hi>dead
ceremony.</hi> And theſe being as <hi>Fundamental to the Obligation</hi> of the
<hi>Covenant,</hi> as the form in <hi>Phiſicals</hi> to the conſtituting of a <hi>diſtinct be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
the whole ſtrength of the <hi>Obligation</hi> lies on it, and only unto the
performance of theſe <hi>things,</hi> which are moſt apt to effect theſe <hi>ends;</hi>
and if any thing we have <hi>ingaged</hi> our ſelves unto, ſhall be found either
not fit to promote theſe, or deſtructive to them (though at firſt they
have ſeemed never ſo convenient, and plauſible) they muſt be removed
out of the way, as diſeaſes in the body, which hazard the diſſolution of
the union.</p>
            <p>This being laid as the <hi>Primum mobile</hi> of the <hi>ingagement,</hi> and ſet
in the <hi>Covenant as the common centre,</hi> many lines were drawn towards
them on every ſide, in order to an union in the firſt principle, and many
Articles propoſed as <hi>mediums</hi> thought moſt ſutable and neceſſary to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
theſe ends.</p>
            <p>And as theſe ends or firſt reaſons were of two ſorts, <hi>viz: Religion,
and Liberty,</hi> the means were proportioned (as was then thought fit)
for the happier effecting both.</p>
            <p>Religion being chief, it was firſt propoſed, and the preſervation of
it taken care for more expreſſely in the firſt, and ſecond <hi>Articles</hi> againſt
the <hi>Common enemy</hi> (who was then well known:) and as in order to
that, we <hi>ingaged</hi> to a <hi>Reformation</hi> of it in <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the word of God, and the beſt Reformed Churches, to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
Popery, Hereſie, Epiſcopacie with all its attendants,</hi> that being unto
Religion as the <hi>ſuckers</hi> to the tree which diverts the moiſture from the
natural branches, and by this we thought Religion ſufficiently provided
for in its preſervation, and <hi>Reformation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next in order was <hi>the juſt Liberty, and Freedom of the Nations,
and the advancement of it,</hi> &amp; as <hi>mediums</hi> unto that, the <hi>Covenant</hi> in the
third and fourth <hi>Articles,</hi> as moſt abſolutely neceſſary <hi>to preſerve the
Priviledges of Parliament;</hi> and becauſe we would let nothing out
that might be probable (though <hi>ex ſuppoſitione remota,</hi> and from a
ſtrain'd charity) we ingaged <hi>to preſerve the Kings perſon,</hi> yet with a
wary <hi>Salvo, in the preſervation of Religion, and Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And laſtly, to prevent any deſign againſt both, we <hi>ingaged to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:165508:8"/>
and bring to condign puniſhment, all Delinquents and Incendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
that acted contrary to theſe propoſed ends.</p>
            <p>Thus you have the whole Covenant anatomized, the two great
pillars on which its Obligation ſtands, which though of different Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
yet are inſeparably united to the preſervation of each other: Now
if any thing without ſhould oppoſe either Religion or Liberty, or
any thing in any Article expreſt ſhould afterwards prove malignant
to either or both, or interfer with any other Article which hath
more of the efficacy of a <hi>medium</hi> to theſe ends, the Obligation to
that ceaſeth, becauſe it will deſtroy the Formal Reaſon by which
I am obliged. Thus it will follow, That if the Kings perſon,
which we are engaged to preſerve, (take him in his beſt capacity)
ſhall ſet up Popery and Prelacy, contrary to Religion, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
Malignancy and Tyranny, contrary to Liberty, we have no
Obligation by the COVENANT to preſerve him, ſeeing be
is deſtructive to theſe abſolute Ends, for which, and in the
PRESERVATION of which, we engage to preſerve
Him.</p>
            <p>But that we may deal plainly and freely in a Caſe of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
let us a little compare the King, and his actings, more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
with the Convenant, and we ſhall finde at laſt, that we
are not onely not engaged to preſerve him, but bound by the
ſtrength of the Covenant to cut him off, as a dead member that is
gangrened.</p>
            <p>I have often wondered out of what ſort of charity or deſign the
Kings name was inſerted in the Covenant, as diſtinct from the
Common Enemy (againſt whom we were firſt ſworn) ſeeing he was
the Head that gave life and motion to every part of that Body,
(without whom they were but as a great Body without Soul or ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
Spirit) they onely fought under his Banners, for his Intereſt, in
oppoſition to the firſt grounds of the Covenant, to diſtinguiſh the
Head and the Members in one Common Cauſe, and to ſwear againſt
the one, and ſwear to preſerve the other, was too great a Criticiſm
to be put in an Oath that muſt binde the Conſcience. For my part,
from the firſt I ſaw that name there (conſidering the ſtate of Affairs
then) I looked upon him as SAUL among the Prophets, or as in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious
times they ſet up ſtately Images to draw men to Church,
and more to reverence the place; or as ſugar put on bitter pills to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:165508:9"/>
make them down the better, with leſs ſcruple of the palate, or nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeouſneſs
of the ſtomack: And if I may uſe the words of Learned
<hi>Calvin,</hi> in another caſe, which you ſhall finde in his Epiſtle prefixed
to his Commentary on the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> having been forc'd to change
the Dedication, and alter the Title of it which was in the firſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
he to whom it was firſt dedicated proving an Apoſtate:
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tinam</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>quo primum tempore in lucem prodiit hic Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarius,vel mihi ignotus, vel ſaltem probe notus fuiſſet ille cujus
nomen huic paginae hactenus inſcriptum nunc delere cogor:</hi> It had
been happy for <hi>ENGLAND</hi> that we had either not known
him, or known him better (as we had Reaſon) and either wholy
let out his name, or had better reaſons to have put it in; for he ever
ſtood as the great <hi>errata</hi> in it, and we might eaſily have fore-ſeen
what end he was deſigned to make, which had ſuch a beginning:
But however, though through hope and charity his name was inſerted,
yet now Reaſon and Conſcience, yea the <hi>COVENANT</hi> it
ſelf, hath given juſt grounds to blot him out, he being the
onely obſtacle to attaining all the honeſt and neceſſary Ends of
it.</p>
            <p>Let us but (without prejudice) view, how that one name, and the
preſervation of it, ſtands oppoſite to all the other Articles and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
in the <hi>COVENANT,</hi> and makes them all uſeleſs and of no
conſequence, that there is an imcompoſſibility of keeping our Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to him, and to keep the others.</p>
            <p>Firſt, for Religion, and theſe Articles which are ſworn unto in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to its preſervation, the preſervation of the Kings perſon would
directly be the overthrowing of them: we had abſolutely ſworn to
extirpate Popery and Prelacy without any limitation, which could not
poſſibly be done with the preſervation of his Majeſties perſon; for
Popery, though I cannot tax him with the profeſsion of it, yet many
correſpondencies have been between him and <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> even
from a childe; his QUEEN a profeſt and Jeſuited PAPIST,
who not onely lay in his boſom, but ruled and guided moſt of
his counſels, that you muſt have either left him a Husband with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a Wife, and have divorced him from his own Soul and Self,
(and from her whoſe he was eternally) or elſe grant at leaſt a
<hi>TOLERATION</hi> to <hi>POPERY,</hi> after we had ſworn
againſt it; Beſides his MAJESTY was in Debt, and ſo far
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:165508:9"/>
in Arrears to the Popiſh party in England and Ireland, for their
faithfull ſervices to him, that he could not be free of regall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
and Covenant-Engagements to them, which muſt have been
remembred upon every advantage, neither could he in honour or
ingenuity have conſented to extirpate them, who had ſo great
an influence to his affairs, and ventured ſo hard for his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive;
thus the King and the firſt and ſecond Article are become
incompetible, cannot ſtand together, and be both preſerved.</p>
            <p>The next thing we ingaged in order to Religion, was the extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Prelacy, and all that Hierarchy, as that which hindred the
ſtrength and growth of the power and life of it, which could
not be hoped for, with the preſervation of his Perſon, nothing
being ſo dear and precious in his eyes, or more ſacred then that
Order; and he profeſt, never to give conſent to abolition of it,
though he was willing to have a reformation of it, or to give a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration
or triall to Presbytery, untill he could get power enough
to ſet up the other; ſo that what would become of the two
firſt Articles, while the Kings name ſtood in force in the Covenant,
except Popery and Prelacy could help to the reformation and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing
of Religion? And as the religious part of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
would not onely be weak'ned, but abſolutely deſtroyed, ſo
the ſecular and humane part, <hi>viz.</hi> the preſervation of Liberty and
Freedome, and all the Articles concerning it, could not be
kept, or poſſibly be made inſtrumentall to their end, if his Perſon
were preſerved; for beſides the firſt wide breach he made on the
Liberties of both Nations by his tyrannical Power and Prerogative,
after we had wrung the weapons wherewith he fought againſt us,
out of his hands, and had tendered to him by Bills and Propoſitions
once and again, the juſt foundations of our Liberties and Freedom,
he continually refuſed to ſign them, and onely pick't out ſome
which we could beſt ſpare, and went on in raiſing of a ſecond
warre, that we had almoſt loſt both name and thing. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
we had ingaged to preſerve the Priviledges of Parliament, it was
impoſſible we could do it, while he ſtill retained his power of a
Negative voice, and challenged a right in ordering the affaires
of the Kingdome by a Supreme power; much leſſe could we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
to bring Delinquents to juſtice, while he himſelfe was the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:165508:10"/>
head of them: And if the native and true ſenſe of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
be the maintenance of Religion and Liberty, againſt a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
enemy, and the King hath proved the chiefe and moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Enemy againſt both, doth not the Covenant oblige all
men againſt him? yea, to remove him out of the way, that
all the other Articles may have their full power, tye and efficacy,
and the ends not have their authority and goodneſſe ſubordinate
to one raſh expreſſion? The putting his name in the Covenant
ſhewed enough the reall deſires we had for his ſafety, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe,
(though there was too much ground of ſuſpition, yea
for unbeliefe, that he would never prove inſtrumentall) and
too much honour and reſpect to be given to the firſt and grand
enemy of both Nations; but it would be ſad and deſperate,
that our love and good hopes ſhould be ſo ill requited, as to
be left remedileſſe, and at a perpetuall loſſe in all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments
by one exotick name thruſt into the Covenant,
the verie mention of which, expunges all the other Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
            <p>If experience or ſenſe could open our eyes, we muſt needs
ſee that there was nothing the King hated ſo much as the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
yea, ſo hated it, as it's thought he ever loved his name
the worſe after he ſaw it there; and if his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> may
be his judge, that ſuppoſed booke of his, which moſt of his
friends owne, there is nothing he ſpends his venome at more
then Covenant and Presbytery, as if he had an Antipathy to
both, not a ſigh of ſenſe ever came from him for all the blood
ſhed, nor a repenting expreſſion for any Act done, but his
conſent to the Bill for taking off the Earle of <hi>Straffords</hi> head,
being more touch'd for a Paraſite then the ruine of three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes;
not any thing could ever be gotten from him in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to any Bill or Propoſition propoſed for our Liberties, but
came as a drop of blood from his heart, and as under force,
with many premeditated reſerves, and at laſt ſealed his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
with his own blood, without ſhewing the leaſt remorſe
for former Acts, or acknowledging any boundary to his will but
God himſelf.</p>
            <p>And yet this man (as if he were the <hi>unum neceſſarium,</hi> and all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:165508:10"/>
Religion and Liberty were eſſentiall to his Perſon) muſt onely
be lamented, and all the breach of Covenant faſt'ned on the
Act of Juſtice on him, without which neither the Covenant or
any Article in it could be dutifully performed. And how much
have men loſt of their underſtandings, and the puritie of their
affections to the Covenant, that ſhall be willing to have the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
rejected, and all the ends and ingagements of it bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
ſo they might have but one expreſſion preſerved? Had the
Parliament given a toleration to Popery, ſet up Prelacy, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
Delinquents and Incendiaries, that our Religion and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
might have been pluck't up by the roots, and ſet up the King
in his Throne, and intail'd the Crowne more firmly on his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
notwithſtanding all theſe conſiderations in the Covenant,
beſides, taking hold of that one clauſe; would the Covenant
have been then kept? let all honeſt men judge; and yet they had
done all theſe vertually, and would have done them really in
time, had they but complied with the King, or done any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
to him, then paſſing a legall and judiciall ſentence on
him.</p>
            <p>But we need go no further then the words of the Ingagement
concerning the King, which are very obſervable, and will end
the controverſie if honeſtly obſerved: For whereas all the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the Covenant are poſitive and abſolute, Religion to be
reformed according to the Word of God, Popery and Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to be extirpated without any diſtinction, the Priviledges of
Parliament to be maintained, Delinquents and Incendiaries to
be brought to juſtice, without any diſcrimination or favour, when
we come to Covenant concerning the Kings Perſon, (as juſtly fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
if not fore-ſeeing what he would prove) it's with an expreſſe
reſtriction, and his whole Perſon and concernments wrapt up in
this clauſe: <hi>In the preſervation of Religion &amp; Liberty,</hi> which was not
only an Expoſition of what we intended concerning him, or on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a limitation, or qualification of our endeavours concerning
him, (though that were enough) but an abſolute and expreſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
and determination of the way and meanes of preſerving
him only in the preſervation of Religion and Liberty, in which
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:165508:11"/>
he was included as the leſſer in the greater; that if theſe two can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be preſerved in preſerving him, he is left alone, for they are
not to be preſerved in him, but he in them: And this condition is
ſo plaine, that you muſt either be bound to the King abſolutely,
without conſideration of Religion or Liberty, or muſt when they
become incompoſſible, ſtick to that which is principall, and of
moſt concernment; and if this clauſe had not been either expreſt
or ſuppoſed, no knowing man who loved his conſcience could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
that being the fundamentall reaſon of our Engagement,
neither can it be well ſuppoſed that moſt of the godly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
people of both Nations vvould deſperately ſvvear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvay
all the priviledges both of Religion and Liberty, in a kind
and loving mood, and to preſerve the Kings Perſon, prove he Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
or Turk, which they muſt needs do, if they did not ingage to
preſerve the King in the preſervation of Religion and Liberty;
ſeeing therefore that theſe were the eſſentiall conditions of our
Obligation to his Perſon, and they have grown incompatible to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
yea diametrically oppoſite, and the ends primarily inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in the Covenant, could not be attained without removing his
Perſon, vvho hath ſo little reaſon to doubt, but vvith a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
yea by the very conſtraints of conſcience, vve are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
from that part of the Covenant, and capable of cloſing
vvith any other that is more fit to proſecute theſe ends.</p>
            <p>So that you may novv perceive that the Kings name vvas in the
Covenant but as a ſeparable accident in its ſubject, <hi>Quod poteſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſe
vel abeſſe ſine ſubjecti interitu,</hi> the Covenant ſtands firme on
its true and ſound baſis, and is kept in its beſt intentions and ends,
though his Perſon be removed, and that elſe the Covenant it ſelf
vvould have been a meer Skeleton and religious cypher, that could
neither be rationally binding, or poſſibly kept.</p>
            <p>Neither can it be by any obſervant eye conjectured, that his Son
ſhould promiſe better things, (by vvhom the Succeſſion is chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged)
yea farre leſſe may be expected from him, vvho hath natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
ſucked in all his Fathers principles, and been at a greater
diſtance from all good counſell and advice, and hath had the moſt
deſperate of the firſt Incendiaries to breed him up, and be his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
counſell, that nothing but the change of the Government can
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:165508:11"/>
free us from the ſucceſſion of tyranny and Prerogative, or give us
any hopes of being happy in after daies.</p>
            <p>And if we do ſoberly conſider it, we have not broken at all the
Covenant, nor changed it in any ſpeciall condition of it, but only
blotted out an unneceſſary and deſtructive name, and inſerted a
more direct medium, for the preſerving the Covenant, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
the more noble and beſt intentions of it, and by taking
this new engagement (which is ſhort, and plain without ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
we take away the grand obſtruction, and ſet it right in its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
beauty, and free it from any future hazards or miſinterpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
the nature of a Common-wealth being to promote com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and publique concernment, both of Religion and Liberty.</p>
            <p>By this time I hope all men may ſee that (among the moſt) its
not conſcience but choler, animoſity, if not malignancy that keeps
men from taking the late Ingagement of the Parliament, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing in the Covenant contrary: and ſeeing no man can be
obliged unto any act which is contrary to a natarall, and morall
good, and that all obligations ceaſe with the firſt reaſons, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
on which they were made, it muſt neceſſarily follow that
all our Ingagements to the Kings perſon, and Monarchicall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
ceaſe alſo, there being nothing left of reaſon to engage
us to them, but our own affections, yea the whole ſtate and nature
of perſons, and things being neceſſarily changed from what they
were, when we firſt engaged our ſelves, &amp; better &amp; more effectuall
waies propounded, we ought to cloſe in with them, and make
conſcience of it.</p>
            <p>But what need I ſpend time, and put any to paines to read this
diſcourſe, when the Aſſembly of Divines have determined the cauſe
concerning the obligation of former oaths, and Covenants, in their
exhortation to the taking of the ſolemn League and Covenant,
ordered by the Parliament to be added to it <hi>(p.</hi> 4.) which is ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
ſpoken to perſwade Clergy men from that plea of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
engagements to the Biſhops, as you may read in theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as for thoſe Clergy men, who pretend that they above all others
cannot covenant to extirpate that Government (meaning Epiſcopall)
becauſe they have (as they ſay) taken a ſolemn Oath to obey the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
in licit &amp; honeſtis:</hi> they can tell if they pleaſe is that they
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:165508:12"/>
that have ſworn obedience to the Laws of the Land, are not
thereby prohibited from endeavouring by all lawfull means the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolition
of theſe Laws, when they prove inconvenient or miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous,
and if yet there ſhould be any oath found, unto which any
Miniſters or others have entred, not warranted by the Laws of
God, and the Land; in this caſe they muſt teach themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
that ſuch oathes call for repentance, not pertinacy in
them.</p>
            <p>There needs no Comment on this, its a full ſolution to all ſuch
Pleas which are drawn from former engagements, when new and
more neceſſary duties are to be preſently performed, or the former
oaths prove miſchievous to more fundamentall and ſpeciall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
There remains nothing now, if we mean to reconcile the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with it ſelf, and make it whole and entire again (having ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
out the grand Errataes of it, and written it over in fairer and
more legible Characters, and all ominous expreſſions expunged)
but to take the new Ingagement to the Common-wealth of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and which is the moſt fit Appendix that can be imagined to be
added, and the laſt and moſt probable means of preſerving all the
ends, and Articles in it; without which we may fondly think to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
our conſciences, but ſhall never be able to keep the Covenant,
it being not rationally to be ſuppoſed, that any thing but Popery,
Prelacy, and Malignancy ſhould flouriſh under either the late King
or his Succeſſors, who were and are engaged only to theſe inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts,
by education and acquaintance, by contract and relations, by
diſpoſition and revenge, yea by all the common ties of friendſhip,
and love, yea and of debt and duty alſo: that if we now paſſe this
year of <hi>Jubilee,</hi> we deſerve not only to have our ears boared, but
our conſciences, and to be made by a divine judgement perfect
ſlaves, as we ſhall be by our voluntary conſents.</p>
