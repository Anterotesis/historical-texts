            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And <hi>Perilous</hi> times, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious times, wherein all that live in them are in danger in one kind or other of being made <hi>partakers</hi> of the ſins of others; either by <hi>complying</hi> with them, or <hi>coming</hi> at them, or <hi>not mourning</hi> for them, or not <hi>appearing</hi> for God againſt them as they ought to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Applic.</hi> Let it be taken notice of by the way; Brethren, there are many amongſt us, (I muſt not ſay <hi>all,</hi> for there are ſome who dreame of <hi>golden</hi> times, and <hi>glorious</hi> times, and <hi>bleſſed</hi> times, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver better, how truly I ſhall ſhow you anon), but many and the greateſt part) complaine of evill times, difficult, grievous, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous times; and therein they are not miſtaken, for they are ſo in truth. But what is it that maketh them ſo? why, the evils of ſin abounding in theſe times. True indeed, there are other
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:117888:5"/>
things which to fleſh &amp; blood are hard, and grievous, and perilous. The <hi>ſword</hi> is yet amongſt us, and <hi>famine</hi> is amongſt us, and <hi>decay of trading</hi> is amongſt us, and though not <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> yet ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſeaſes which are looked upon as to a degree infectious and contagious, are amonſt us. But behold greater evils then theſe. All kind of <hi>ſinful abominations</hi> are to be found in the midſt of us. And theſe are they which make the times to be ſo evill times.</p>
            <p>Taking notice of this, withall take notice of the way, the next way, the onely way to mend theſe times. Every of us mend our ſelves; mend the <hi>Perſons,</hi> and mend the <hi>Times.</hi> As for <hi>judgments,</hi> it is in vaine to repine and murmure at them, to lift at them. This is but as the galled horſe that ſeeketh to ſhake off his burden, which, being faſtned to him, galleth him ſo much the more. Judgments they muſt do the work for which they are ſent, execute their <hi>Commiſſion.</hi> Let our hands be againſt the evils of ſin. Every of us endeavouring according to our (now almoſt forgotten) <hi>Covenant, to go each before other in a reall Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our own hearts and lives.</hi> This is the way to make the <hi>ſtreet</hi> clean; every one to ſweep before his own dore. And this is the way to make the times better, every one to mend, to reforme one. This is the trueſt <hi>Emondatio temporum,</hi> amending of the times, to amend the perſons in thoſe times. So long as men are ſuch as the Apoſtle here deſcribeth ſome, it is impoſſible the times ſhould be good. No, they will be, they muſt be <hi>difficult, trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, dangerous, evill</hi> times.</p>
            <p>But what kind of <hi>men</hi> are they which have ſuch a maligne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the times, to make them ſo evill? This the Apoſtle ſets forth in the ſequel of this verſe; where he reckons up a <hi>Catalogue of vices,</hi> which if once they come to be <hi>Epidemical,</hi> rife and common, they infect and poyſon the times, proving dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and pernicious to the Church. The firſt is <hi>Self-love,</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, there is a Blaſphemy againſt the <hi>Word</hi> of God, the  ſacred <hi>Scriptures.</hi> When men ſhall derogate from their <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Sufficiencie, Perfection, Certainty.</hi> Such is the Blaſphemy of thoſe who <hi>deny</hi> them to be the Word of God; or ſpeak <hi>contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meliouſly</hi> and <hi>diſgracefully</hi> of them, as a <hi>dead letter,</hi> a <hi>Leſbian lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Rule</hi> a <hi>noſe of Wax, Inkie Divinity,</hi> which is the language of ſome of the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, There is a Blaſphemy againſt the <hi>Religion</hi> of God;  When men ſhall ſpeak againſt it, as the <hi>Jewes</hi> did againſt <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 45. <hi>They ſpake againſt thoſe things which were ſpoken by</hi> Paul, <hi>contradicting and blaſpheming.]</hi> Or having imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the true Religion of God, ſhall afterwards <hi>renounce</hi> it, make defection from it, whether through <hi>fear,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing and perſecuting of Chriſtians he made them to <hi>Blaſpheme,</hi> Acts 26. 11. viz. by abjuring or renouncing their Religion.

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly and laſtly, God may be ſaid to be blaſphemed in his  Image. And that not only in his <hi>Eſſential</hi> Image, his Son Chriſt, who is God equal with his Father: and ſo what is done to the one by way of honour or diſhonour, redoundeth to the other, as our Saviour himſelf tels the Jewes, <hi>John</hi> 5. 23. but alſo to his <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental</hi> Image.

So again to ſpeak evill of any of the Saints of God, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſuch, this alſo is <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> 1 Pet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. 4. <hi>They ſpeak</hi>

Such are the reproaches and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumelies which are caſt upon any for righteouſneſſe ſake; no leſſe then <hi>Blaſphemies,</hi> ſtriking at God through their ſides, in whom <note place="margin">Iſa. 37<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 23, 24.</note>his <hi>Image</hi> is conſpicuous. All theſe wayes the name of God may be ſaid to be blaſphemed. So as there are diverſe kinds of blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies againſt God.</p>
            <p>And as there are diverſe <hi>kinds,</hi> ſo there are diverſe <hi>degrees.</hi> There is a Blaſphemy which is of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and there is a <hi>Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Blaſphemy. The former when men <hi>ſpeak evill of what they know not:</hi> ſpeak evill of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Chriſt, of his Religion, &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they know no better. Such was <hi>Pauls Blaſphemy</hi> before his converſion. <hi>I was a Blaſphemer</hi> (ſaith he) But how ſo? <hi>I did it ignorantly,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 13. The latter is, when men having beene <hi>inlightned,</hi> and having <hi>taſted of the heavenly gift, and beene made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</hi> &amp;c. (as the Apoſtle deſcribeth the qualification of an Apoſtate, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5.) <hi>having received the knowledge of the truth</hi> (as we have it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26.) ſhall afterwards fall away, ſo as to ſpeak evill of that way wherein before they walked, to deride and mock it; this our Saviour calleth <hi>Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt the Holy Ghost,</hi> Matth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 12. 31. viz. not againſt the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> but againſt the <hi>work</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt; againſt the work of <hi>Illumination,</hi> and <hi>Conviction</hi> in the ſoule. Of all kinds and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> this is moſt dreadful. <hi>Blaſphemie,</hi> though it be of <hi>ignorance,</hi> is a ſin of a high nature. So <hi>Paul</hi> looked upon it after his converſion; reckoning up this as one of the ſins which made him in his own apprehenſion the <hi>Chief of ſinners,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 15. But <hi>malicious Blaſphemy</hi> is inexpiable; a ſin, and the only ſin exempt from mercy. <hi>All manner of ſin and Blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven, but the Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given unto men,</hi> Matth. 12. 31.</p>
            <p>Thus have I with what brevity I could, laid before you the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, kinds,</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> of this ſin, which the Apoſtle here foretel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth ſhould in after times prove rife and common in the Church. <hi>[Men ſhall be Blaſphemers],</hi> ſpeaking evill of the <hi>name of God,</hi> and ſo wronging and diſhonouring him in his <hi>Titles, Properties, Works, Word, Religion, Ordinances, Image.</hi> Some in one kinde, ſome in another.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2.

            <p>The <hi>Blaſphemie</hi> which we are this day principally to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, is the <hi>Blaſphemy of thoſe who ſay they are Jewes, but are not;</hi> ſuch as pretend to Religion, making an outward <hi>profeſſion</hi> of it, and yet are <hi>Blaſphemers.</hi> And are there not ſuch to be found in this Nation that I ſay not in this place)? <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> and yet <hi>Blaſphemers.</hi> Men that profeſſe to ſtand for God, and for Chriſt, and for his Religion, pretending to <hi>more of God</hi> then others, and yet Blaſpheme all.

of <hi>Hereſies</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemies</hi> which is broke forth upon this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at this day; when theſe have done the work for which they are permitted and ſent, <hi>viz.</hi> made manifeſt thoſe which are approved, they ſhall return again to that <hi>Abyſſe,</hi> that <hi>great deep,</hi> that <hi>bottomleſſe pit,</hi> the <hi>pit of Hell,</hi> from whence they came.</p>
            <p>And therefore for us, let us in the mean time with <hi>Noah</hi> and his family, keep cloſe within the <hi>Arke,</hi> within the Arke of the <hi>Church,</hi> waiting for the abating and drying up of theſe waters; not doubting but that God in his due time will finde an <hi>Ararat</hi> for his poor weather-beaten Church to reſt upon.

            <p>And ſo looking upon it, let us be accordingly affected with it, <hi>mourning for the evils in theſe times:</hi> Not ſo much for <hi>Penal</hi> evils, the outward <hi>Calamities</hi> and <hi>Judgments</hi> which are amongſt

For theſe ſins the Land mourns at this day; and (unleſſe God in mercy ſtep in) is like to mourn yet more then ever. For theſe let us mourn.</p>
            <p>And as for all the reſt of the abominations, ſo for this in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner. The horrid and prodigious <hi>Blaſphemies</hi> that are to be found in the midſt of us. O let every ſoule that <hi>heareth</hi> them, or <hi>heareth of them</hi> be thus affected with them. So were the people of God amongſt the Jewes wont to be affected with this ſinne. No ſin went ſo near their hearts as this, this of <hi>Blaſphemy.</hi> So much they were wont to expreſſe by the <hi>rending of their garments</hi> at the hearing of the name of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> blaſphemed. So did <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah's</hi> Commiſſioners, <hi>Eliakim</hi> and the reſt; when they heard <hi>Rabſhakeh's Blaſphemies, they rent their cloaths,</hi> Iſa. 36. <hi>ult.</hi> And ſo did <hi>Hezekiah</hi> himſelf, when it was by them reported to him, he did the like, <hi>chap.</hi> 37. <hi>verſe</hi> 1.

This did they to expreſſe the <hi>rending of their hearts</hi> with grief and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation at what they heard, or heard of. And what cauſe have we to do the like, who hear of thoſe horrid <hi>Blaſphemies</hi> which are ſo rife in this Nation at this day?</p>
            <p>Eſpecially when we conſider from <hi>whom</hi> theſe Blaſphemies come, from what mouths they break forth.

Take ſome which I conceive to be moſt proper.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the firſt place, <hi>Labour for a diſtinct, ſound, well grounded knowledge in the principles of Chriſtian Religion.</hi> For the moſt part <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> is the fruit of <hi>Ignorance.</hi> Theſe men (ſaith Saint <hi>Jude,</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Blaſphemers,</hi> who <hi>ſpeak evill of Dignities) they ſpeak evill of things which they know not,</hi> Jude v. 10. And truly, ſo do <hi>Blaſphemers</hi> for the moſt part, they ſpeak evill of things which they know not. So did <hi>Paul</hi> before his converſion, he was a <hi>Blaſphemer,</hi> ſpeaking evill of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Religion,</hi> but he did it <hi>Ignorantly.</hi> Certainly, did men know <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Religion,</hi> they would not dare to open their mouths againſt them <hi>Had they known, they would never have crucified the Lord of Glory,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>Princes,</hi> the Rulers of the earth), 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:117888:20"/>
And ſo may we ſay of many <hi>Blaſphemers;</hi> did they but know <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Truth,</hi> they would not <hi>Crucifie</hi> them, peirce them thorough as they do. Labour for a wel-grounded knowledge of God and his Truth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Receive the love of the truth.</hi> For the want of this it is that <hi>God giveth men up to ſtrong deluſions that they ſhould beleeve lyes,</hi> falſe doctrines, Hereſies and Blaſphemous opinions, <hi>[becauſe they receive not the love of the Truth,</hi> 2 Theſ. 2. 11.] They receive the truth into their <hi>Heads,</hi> in a <hi>ſpeculative</hi> way, ſo as to be <hi>inlightned</hi> by it, but not into their <hi>Hearts,</hi> in an <hi>affective</hi> way, to be <hi>warmed</hi> by it. Let not us content our ſelves with the former of theſe. Thoſe <hi>Revolters</hi> whom the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> ſpeaks of, were ſuch as were once <hi>inlightned,</hi> Heb. 6. 4. ſuch as had <hi>received the knowledge of the truth,</hi> cap. 10. v. 26. It is no newes for <hi>illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated Doctours,</hi> learned men to turne <hi>Apoſtates, Hereticks.</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour we to finde <hi>heat</hi> as well as <hi>light;</hi> that with the <hi>knowledge</hi> of the truth, we may have a <hi>love</hi> of the Truth. This <hi>Love will be ſtrong as death</hi> (Cant. 8. 6.) nothing ſhall conquer it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In the third place, knowing and loving the Truth, <hi>Walk in it:</hi> This is the commendation which Saint <hi>John</hi> giveth of the children of that <hi>Elect Lady, Joh.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>They walked in the truth.</hi> This is the true Chriſtians commendation, not that he <hi>knoweth</hi> the Truth, of <hi>talketh</hi> of it, but that he <hi>walketh</hi> in it; <hi>acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing th truth, the Doctrine which is according to Godlineſſe</hi> (as our Apoſtle deſcribeth the doctrine of the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 3. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 1.) and <hi>that by reducing it to practice,</hi> which is the trueſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment; leading a life befitting the profeſſion of the truth, in all uprightneſſe and ſincerity. Thus <hi>knowing God,</hi> let <hi>us glorifie him as God,</hi> by walking before him in <hi>Truth;</hi> not daring to do any thing againſt the Truth. <hi>We can do nothing againſt the Truth, but for the Truth,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 8. Being thus ſincere with God, walking in the Truth, we ſhall through his grace be kept from this great tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But (in the fourth place), <hi>walk humbly.</hi> This is one of the things which the Lord requireth from his people, that they <hi>walk humbly with their God,</hi> Mic. 6. 8. O that every of us could but take out this leſſon! Surely the want of this it is that hath proved ſo baneful to many of our now ſeducing and ſeduced brethren. They ſeemed to walk with God; I, but they did not <hi>walk hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:117888:21"/>
with him. Their ſouls were <hi>lifted vp within them,</hi> lifted up in the apprehenſion of their own graces, gifts, parts, &amp;c. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it that God hath thus left them into the hands of this his <hi>meſſenger</hi> Satan, thus to be <hi>buffeted by his Blaſphemous tentations.</hi> Let their fall be a Caveat to us. Take we heed leſt our hearts be exalted, through the abundance of what ever ſpiritual priviledges we are made partakers of. The ſtory tels us of King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when the <hi>Babylonian Ambaſſadours</hi> came to congratulate his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery from that dangerous ſickneſſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 39. he in a vain glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious humour ſhewed them all his treaſures, that ſo the fame of his wealth and magnificence might be carried abroad to forraine Princes. But what was the iſſue? This <hi>vainglory</hi> proved fatal to his Kingdome, betraying all thoſe treaſures into the hands of thoſe <hi>Babylonians.</hi> Thus dealeth God ſometimes by his people, when they will be proud of their <hi>ſpiritual treaſures,</hi> making oſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their gifts and graces, God leaveth them into the hands of Satan to be made a prey of by him, and for a time to be taken, and <hi>carried captive by him at his will,</hi> (as our Apoſtle ſpeaketh of ſome Apoſtates, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2 2, 26.) And therefore ſee that we walk humbly with God, thinking meanly of our ſelves, prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring others before our ſelves.</p>
            <p>To theſe obvious directions I might adde many more. St. <hi>Jude</hi> furniſheth me with three or four very proper in this caſe.

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Keep your ſelves in the love of God].</hi> A direction which may be taken and underſtood three wayes, and each uſeful to our preſent purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Keep your ſelves in the love of God, viz. <hi>Gods love to you.</hi> Being in grace and favour with God, and having ſome comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table apprehenſions thereof, take heed of doing ought that ſhould cauſe God to turne his face from you, to withdraw the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:117888:22"/>
light of his countenance, the ſenſe and feeling of his love and favour from you, or cauſe him to frowne upon you. This will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very preſumptuous ſin, every ſin againſt light and conſcience, do. Every ſuch a ſin will be like a dark cloud coming betwixt the Sun and the earth, intercepting the light of Gods countenance. So did <hi>Davids</hi> ſin, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. Whereupon he begs a <hi>reſtoring of the joy of his ſalvation.</hi> O therefore, being in the love of God, <hi>keep your ſelves in it,</hi> Be afraid to offend him, leſt he ſhould hide his face from you, and ſo ſuffer you to wander in the dark, and ſo to ſtumble and fall.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Keep your ſelves in the love of God, viz. <hi>your love to God.</hi> Finding your hearts once cloſing with God, and a cleaving to him, now perſevere in that love; labouring to finde your hearts more and more inamoured with him, more enlarged towards him. This love of God and of Jeſus Chriſt will preſerve the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſoul from making defection from him and his truth. This it was which cauſed <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>keep faith and a good conſcience,</hi> ſo as he could do nothing againſt the truth; <hi>the love of Christ conſtrained him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Keep your ſelves in the love of God, viz. <hi>in a fraternal love,</hi> love to the Brethren, which may be called the <hi>love of God,</hi> in as much, Firſt, as it is <hi>commanded</hi> by him; and Secondly, <hi>wrought</hi> by him, (in both which reſpects he is called the <hi>God of love,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 11.) and Thirdly, it is <hi>for his ſake.</hi> In this love of God <hi>keep your ſelves,</hi> not ſuffering your hearts to be divided, alienated from, much leſſe ſet againſt thoſe who are members of the ſame body. This <hi>oppoſition,</hi> or <hi>alienation</hi> will increaſe unto more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe. Keep your ſelves therefore in the love of God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth and laſt direction is yet behinde <hi>Looking for the mercie of our Lord Jeſus Christ unto eternall life].</hi> A uſefull direction ſpecially in difficult and dangerous times, wherein Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are in danger of being <hi>compelled to blaſpheme,</hi> to renounce, and abjure the truths of God, which they hane profeſſed, through the rigour of cruel and mercileſſe perſecutors who have got pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er into their hands: which was the caſe (as I ſhowed you) of ſome of thoſe <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> which perſecuting <hi>Paul</hi> had to deale with, <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 11. Now in ſuch times, wherein men can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no <hi>mercy,</hi> (nor yet <hi>juſtice)</hi> nothing but extremity of rigour from men, now look for the <hi>mercy of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> who
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:117888:23"/>
taking notice of the <hi>patience</hi> and <hi>conſtancie</hi> of his Saints in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining his truth, will not be wanting to them in a gracious remu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. <hi>Behold I come quickly, and my reward is with me</hi> (ſaith that <hi>Amon,</hi> that faithful and true witneſſe, the Lord Jeſus) <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 11. Chriſt ere long will come; and when he cometh, he will not come empty-handed. <hi>He will give to every man according to his works</hi> (as it there followeth). And therefore (as the verſe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going hath it), <hi>Let him that is righteous be righteous ſtill, and he that is holy let him be holy still].</hi> Have we owned God and his truths, and appeared for them by profeſſion and practice? Do we ſo ſtill. So doing, what ever we meet with from men, we ſhall be ſure of the <hi>mercy of our Lord Jeſus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus have I (with what brevity I could) preſented unto you ſome uſeful <hi>directions,</hi> which may be as <hi>preſervatives</hi> unto you againſt the <hi>poyſon of thoſe Heretical Blaſphemies</hi> of ſeducing Teachers and Apoſtatized profeſſours, which are ſo rife in this Church at this day, whereby you may (through the mercy of God) be kept from the infection of them, from partaking in them as <hi>Principals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is not enough. <hi>Take heed</hi> (in the ſecond place) <hi>lest you partake herein as Acceſſories.</hi> Here is the ſecond part of this Admonition, which I beſeech you give eare unto, as that which in ſome branch of it will concerne every of you. This is <hi>Paul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> Caveat to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>Be not partaker of other mens ſin; Keep thy ſelfe pure].</hi> Pure, not only from being a <hi>Principal</hi> in them, but alſo an <hi>Acceſſory</hi> to them, (of which latter the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle there properly ſpeaks, as I ſhall ſhew you anon. And let the ſame counſel be as acceptable to all of us as it is in it ſelf ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and needful. Take we heed of partaking in this great and dreadful evil of <hi>Heretical Blaſphemies,</hi> not only as Principals in it, but as <hi>Acceſſories</hi> to it. Which men may be many wayes. Give me leave to inſtance in ſome of the moſt obvious, that you taking notice of them, may the better decline them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By countenancing of them.</hi> This I take from Saint <hi>John</hi> in his ſecond Epiſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 10, 11. <hi>If there come any among you, and bring not this Doctrine, receive him not into your houſe, neither bid him God ſpeed; For he that biddeth him God speed, is partaker of his evill deeds].</hi> A paſſage which ſpeaketh home to the point in hand. Reflect upon it again. <hi>If there come any unto you and bring not</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:117888:23"/>
               <hi>this Doctrine],</hi> that is, bring a contrary doctrine, contrary to the doctrine of which he ſpeaketh in the verſe foregoing, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt, <hi>[receive him not into your houſe]</hi> lodge him not, entertain him not: <hi>[neither bid him God ſpeed]</hi> ſhew him no countenance, give him no encouragement: <hi>[for he that biddeth him God speed, is partake of his evill deeds]</hi> maketh himſelf <hi>acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory</hi> to his ſin by this collateral conſent and allowance, by ſeeming to approve of what he ought to reprove.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If by countenancing, much more by <hi>impowring</hi> ſuch manner of perſons. This I take up from the Apoſtle writing to <hi>Timothy</hi> in the place forenamed, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 22. where he giveth him this Caveat, <hi>Lay hands ſuddenly on no man,</hi> viz. in <hi>Ordination</hi> (ſo it is moſt commonly, and moſt properly expounded). Herein <hi>Paul</hi> willeth <hi>Timothy</hi> to be adviſed, ſo as not to have any hand in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal ing any into any <hi>Eccleſiaſticall function,</hi> who were not appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable both for <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>life.</hi> Adding this for a Reaſon; <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be partaker of other mens ſins]. Timothy</hi> by ordaining, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powring of an Heretical falſe teacher, giving him an advantage to ſpread his falſe doctrine with authority, ſhould make himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory to all that miſchief which ſhould redound unto the Church by ſo pernicious an Inſtrument.</p>
            <p>A point which I wiſh it might be taken notice of by all thoſe who have or may have power to impower others, whether in a <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> way, to promote and inſtall any in any place or office of publike truſt, whether in the <hi>Church</hi> or <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</hi> If ſo be they be men of dangerous and poyſonous prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, ſuch as thoſe <hi>Heretical Blaſphemers</hi> I have been ſpeaking of, let them take heed how they <hi>lay hands on them</hi> (unleſſe it be in ſecuring their perſons from doing any farther harme); how they have any hand in putting advantages into their hands, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may ſpread the contagion of their Errours to the indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering of the ſouls of others. In ſo doing they ſhall make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves partakers of their ſin, <hi>acceſſories</hi> to all the evill that accru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Church of God by their means.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A third way is by <hi>tolerating</hi> and ſuffering of ſuch. This I take from the spirit writing to the <hi>Churches, Rev.</hi> 2. Writing to the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> he layeth this to the charge of the Angel there, that he <hi>had in that Church them which held the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of</hi> Balaam, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>and them which held the doctrine of the</hi>

               </gap> And ſo the word here ſignifieth, an obſtinate and pertinacious holding of thoſe heretical doctrines, (which properly maketh an <hi>Heretick).</hi> Such Hereticks there were ſome in that Church.

               </gap>, <hi>Thou haſt them,</hi> i. e. thou tolerateſt and ſuffereſt them, not proceeding againſt them according to that authority committed unto thee. So you have it more plainly in that charge againſt the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> v. 20. <hi>I have a few things againſt thee, becauſe thou ſuffereſt that woman</hi> Jezebel, <hi>which calleth her ſelf a Propheteſſe, to teach and ſeduce my people].</hi> This TOLERATION, where that power which God hath committed to any for the ſuppreſſing, reforming, or puniſhing of ſuch Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Blaſphemers, is not put forth, but they are connived at, born with, this involves thoſe who are herein failing in their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in the guilt of that ſin, maketh them acceſſories to it. The Rule is ancient and true, <hi>Qui non vetat peccare cum poſſit jubet,</hi> who ſo having power to prohibit or hinder an evill, ſhall not put forth that power, maketh himſelf (at leaſt) acceſſory to it. This do <hi>Church-officers</hi> in the <hi>ſtate Eccleſiaſtical;</hi> Having liberty to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe that power which Jeſus Chriſt hath committed to them for the edification of his Church under himſelf, if they ſhall not put it forth for the ſuppreſſing of ſo great an evill as this, they thereby become acceſſories to it.

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this it is anſwered. This <hi>Moſes</hi> did not out of any ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that he had, whether he deſerved death or no.

But his ſcruple was about the <hi>kind of death,</hi> which in as much as God had not determined in particular, he made a queſtion whether that which was inflicted for a far leſſe offence, were not too light for this. <hi>Blasphemy</hi> being the <hi>higheſt ſin</hi> deſerveth to be puniſhed <hi>extremis ſuppliciis</hi> (as the phraſe of the Civil law is) with the <hi>higheſt kind of puniſhment.</hi> So doth <hi>Immediate Blaſphemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>Mediate</hi> and <hi>Immediate</hi> Blaſphemy, it is to be weighed and conſidered according to the aforeſaid <hi>Modification &amp; reſpects;</hi> whether it be <hi>ſudden</hi> or <hi>deliberate;</hi> whether of <hi>infirmity,</hi> or <hi>perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy;</hi> and accordingly the puniſhment is to be qualified. So much we may learn from St. <hi>Jude,</hi> who ſpeaking of ſuch kind of perſons, willeth Chriſtians, <hi>of ſome to have compaſſion, making a difference, Jude v.</hi> 22. yet ſo as the ſin ought not to be connived at, not paſſed by. Specially in <hi>confirmed, habituated</hi> and <hi>preſumptuous blaſphemers,</hi> ſuch as do adviſedly or cuſtomarily utter, or obſtinately maintaine what tends to the high diſhonour of God. In this caſe the name of God calleth for a vindication from them who do not beare the ſword for nought: who if they ſhall now connive at <hi>offences</hi> and <hi>offendors</hi> of this nature, ſuffering them to go unpuniſhed, in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they make themſelves partakers of the ſin, <hi>Acceſſories</hi> to it. This do publike perſons by <hi>Tolerating,</hi> not <hi>Puniſhing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. And this (in the fourth place, to haſten in that which remains) may private perſons do, <hi>by not reproving,</hi> not ſhewing their diſlike, and deteſtation of this ſin. Not <hi>Reproving</hi> of it. <hi>Have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſſe, but reprove them rather;</hi> So the Apoſtle layeth down the general Injunction, <hi>Eph,</hi> 5. 11. agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to that Preſcription in the Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 17. <hi>Thou ſhalt in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiſe rebuke thy neighbour, and not ſuffer ſin upon him].</hi> This are Chriſtians to do with a <hi>wiſe and holy zeale;</hi> as in other caſes, ſo in this making uſe of ſeaſonable <hi>Admonitions</hi> and <hi>Reprehenſions,</hi> where
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:117888:26"/>
there is any hope they may take place. Otherwiſe the Rule is, <hi>Caſt not pearls before ſwine,</hi> Matth. 7. 6. <hi>Rebuke not a ſcorner leſt he hate thee,</hi> Prov. 9. 8. Perſons deſperatly wicked and profane are not to be dealt withal in this way. Admonitions and Reprehenſions ſo <hi>ſpent,</hi> will be <hi>miſ-ſpent;</hi> Nay, it may be, prove like <hi>oyle</hi> to the <hi>fire, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming</hi> inſtead of <hi>quenching.</hi> Upon this ground it was that <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiahs Commiſſioners</hi> when they heard <hi>Rab ſhakeh</hi> blaſpheming in that deſperate way, <hi>they anſwered him not a word,</hi> Iſa. 36. 21. deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in vain to make any reply, when it would but incite him to farther outrage. But where there is any hope that reproofs may be hearkned to, Chriſtians may not be tongue-tyed, they ought to ſpeak for God.</p>
            <p>However, ſome way or other they are to manifeſt their diſlike and deteſtation of this ſin. It was a <hi>Canon</hi> amongſt the Jewes (as I hinted it before), that <hi>whoſoever heard Blaſphemy of the name of God, whether he heard it himſelf, or heard it by the report of another, he was bound to rend his cloaths.</hi> And ſo did thoſe <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> (as I told you), though they held their peace, yet they rent their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This <hi>Ceremony</hi> was <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> but the <hi>Moral</hi> and meaning of it is <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> Chriſtians ought not to have the name of God blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed, but they ought ſome way or other to manifeſt their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of it, and indignation againſt it. Which not doing, they may ſeem to approve of what they do neither by <hi>word</hi> nor <hi>ſigne</hi> reprove, and ſo may become <hi>Acceſſories</hi> to this higheſt of ſins.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Again (in the fifth place) this may be done by a <hi>voluntary aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociating with ſuch kind of perſons,</hi> entertaining unneceſſary fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity or ſociety with them. This Chriſtians may not do. It is <hi>Pauls</hi> charge to his <hi>Corinthians</hi> concerning ſcandalous perſons in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that they ſhould not <hi>company</hi> with ſuch, not eate with them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 9. 11. that is, not have any intimate and unneceſſary fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with them.

            <p n="6">6. Again (in the ſixth place) Chriſtians may be made acceſſories to this ſin, <hi>by not mourning for it.</hi> Thus are all Chriſtians to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the <hi>ſcandalous fals</hi> of their brethren. <hi>Paul</hi> blameth his <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that taking notice of that <hi>Inceſtuous</hi> perſon, they were yet <hi>puffed up, and had not rather mourned, that he who had done that deed might be taken away from among them,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 2.

And ſo do they in <hi>England</hi> at this day, who hearing of ſuch horrid <hi>Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi> as are dayly belched out againſt the God of heaven, againſt his <hi>Truth,</hi> his <hi>wayes,</hi> his <hi>Ordinances,</hi> and being called upon to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their ſouls for them, are yet puffed up with an apprehenſion of ſuch <hi>glorious</hi> times, ſuch <hi>happy</hi> and <hi>bleſſed</hi> times; and do not rather <hi>mourn,</hi> mourn for the ſin, that ſo the <hi>offendors</hi> might either be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,</hi> or <hi>puniſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. In the laſt place (to name no more) Chriſtians may be acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory to this ſin by being <hi>occaſions</hi> of it.

And thus is the <hi>Religion</hi> of God ſubject to be blaſphemed through the <hi>ſcandalous lives</hi> of Chriſtians.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:117888:28"/>
truly thus hath it been in this unhappy <hi>Interregnum,</hi> this deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble interval of <hi>Church Government</hi> in this Nation. While the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer government hath been laid aſide, and no other effectually ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in the roome of it, every man hath done in matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion what was right in his own eyes. And <hi>hinc illae lachrymae,</hi> hence is it that this ſea of evils hath broken in upon the Church of God. For the ſtopping of the courſe hereof, let all who wiſh well to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> do what in them lyeth to promote the cauſe of God, in erecting a <hi>Government</hi> in his Church. This is the <hi>means</hi> which Chriſt hath ſanctified for the freeing of his Church from theſe great evils. Of the force and efficacy whereof all ages have had ſufficient experience. In the laſt age, (as bad as the Government then was, whether in the <hi>Title</hi> or <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> whether in the <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> or <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> and management of it, yet) ſuch <hi>night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birds</hi> as theſe durſt not then fly abroad. Though ſome comparativly <hi>ſleighter errors</hi> began then to put up head, yet groſſer <hi>Hereſies</hi> durſt not appear. (An inſtance ſufficient to make good that received maxime, that <hi>Tyranny is better then Anarchie. Better an ill-mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Government then no Government.)</hi> In other of the <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> where that form of Government, which was ſuppoſed to be modelled and laid out for this Church, hath obtained eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment and countenance, ſuch evil weeds as theſe have not been ordinarily found to grow, at leaſt not to flouriſh under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of it. So far hath Chriſt owned that (for ſubſtance) his <hi>owne Ordinance,</hi> as that few ſuch deſperate <hi>Blaſphemous Hereticks</hi> have been found in thoſe Churches. That the Church of God amongſt us may enjoy the like mercy, all of us contribute what we may, our <hi>Prayers and endeavours,</hi> that the work of God may be carried on for the ſetting up of a <hi>wall,</hi> a <hi>fence</hi> about this his <hi>vineyard,</hi> his <hi>ſheepfold;</hi> a wall, a fence of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Government</hi> about this Church, which till it be, it cannot in a rational and ordinary way be expected or hoped, that theſe <hi>Foxes</hi> ſhould be kept from ſpoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our <hi>Vines,</hi> or theſe <hi>Wolves</hi> from tearing and worrying the poor <hi>Lambs</hi> of Chriſt Thus far the Application hath run in a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral way.</p>
