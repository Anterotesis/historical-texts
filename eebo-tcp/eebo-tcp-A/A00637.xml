            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

policie, and that according to the preſent occaſion offered, without any preſcript worde, but onely by the inſtinct of Gods ſpirite. Further, that the Apoſtles ſet out the qualitie of the men to be choſen, but tied them to no certayne forme of election to be obſerued, neither doe we reade what forme of election they then v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Againe, that the Diſciples were to looke out and choſe ſuch, as they thought fitte to be truſted with the Church-ſtocke, but the Apoſtles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued to them-ſelues the appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them to their office, if they ſhould be founde to be ſuch as were deſcribed. Moreouer, that the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons were appoynted for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eaſe of the Apoſtles in ſome part of their function. Laſtly, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples preſented them to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles cenſures: who by impoſition of handes did as it were conſecrate and authorize them to the function of Deaconſhip. Now if by this act our authour mind ſo hard to curbe vp al churches, as that he will accuſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to

giue a counterbuff to the holy ghoſt, which in their ordinations doe not agree herewith in all circumſtaunces: or that he will tell vs that ſomething extraordinary was here in this action not to bee followed, then muſt hee ſhewe by direct Scripture what was ordinary and what was extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and muſt reconcile other places of Scripture concerning like action, which doe not agree in all poyntes with this. In the firſt of the Actes, two were preſented, one is choſen by lot and no impoſition of handes: heere ſeuen are choſen, the manner not ſet downe by the multitude, and being preſented to the Apoſtles, they all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt them and lay their handes on them.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:2079:21"/>
that is, in ſteed of ouerthrowing the conſent of people in Church-electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to make warre againſt a meere po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puler Election, not gouerned with the fore-direction of the Elders, which hath no ground in the ſcriptures, and was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer maintained (as him ſelfe confeſſeth) but by Anabaptiſtes: and in ſteede of manly buckling with the ſubſtantiall pointes of Church-election, with the foreleading of the Preſbytery, with the due conſent of the people, cowardly to betake himſelf vnto the changeable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the ſame; as who ſhould preſent, the Elders or the people; howe the people ſhoulde ſignify their conſent by lifting vp their handes, or otherwiſe by themſelues or by proctors, and diuers ſuch other. Which in the particuler an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere following ſhall be declared, howe according to the word of God they may vpon diuers circumſtances, be diuerſly carried. His contrariety to him felfe is apparant by theſe three partie-coloured aſſertions. <hi>Firſt, that the people did choſe without the Apoſtles.

                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:2079:22"/>

Thirdly, that the people pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented them to the Apoſtles cenſures.</hi> For, that hee ſayth, they choſe without the Apoſtles, is directly contrary to that he ſayth, they preſented them to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Cenſures, ſo that their Election was to be diſanulled and made none, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe by the examination of the Apoſtles they were founde aunſwerable to their deſcription. His agreement with the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and namely with the Romiſh <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> Teſtament, doth notably appeare, in that they appoynting, (as he doth) the fift verſe of the 1. of Titus, to the conſent of the people in the Election of their Miniſter, they doe more breefly, but as fully and plainly, and with more curteſy to the trueth ſet downe both his aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, reaſons and auncient Teſtimonies, in theſe fewe words following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And here it ſeemeth that he did not only conſecrate them whom the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had elected before, but him ſelfe alſo made choyſe of the perſons, no</hi>

                  <hi>mention being heere made of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther election populer, which though it vvere long vſed in the primitiue Church, yet for diuers cauſes, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for continuall tumults, partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and diſorders which Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine much complaineth of in his time, was iuſtly taken away, and other better meanes of their deſignement appointed. See concil. Laodic. cap. 12. 13.</hi> So much the Papiſts. Again, how he iumpeth with the ſpirite of theſe Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites (ſauing that ſtill they yeelde more to the trueth then he) in ſaying, <hi>That the Apoſtles ſhewed the people what to do, without any preſcript worde, but onely by the inſtinct of Gods ſpirite:</hi> may appeare by their words which they vſe vpon the like occaſion of Peter, in their annotation on the 15. verſe of the 1. Chapter of the Actes: <hi>Which Peter</hi> (ſaie they) <hi>did, not vpon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maundement of Chriſte written, but by ſuggeſtion of God his ſpirit, and by vnderſtanding of the Scriptures of the old Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to that purpoſe.</hi> So far the papiſts: And thus much generallye of his diſcourſe.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:2079:23"/>
Now of his particuler obiections, the firſt is, that he thincketh in no Church the whole number of people to haue free election of their Paſtor. If by free elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he meane the due conſent of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, either he ſpeaketh againſt his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or he knoweth not that he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, ſeeing their confeſſions other their writinges and practize, do (in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all thoſe which know any thing in this matter,) euidently conuince him, as may appeare by the quotations in the<note place="margin">Harmonia confeſ. pag. 43.

If he meane, that the people ſhould beare the whole ſwaye without the gouernment and direction of the Elders, hee miſſeth the marke whereat hee aymeth. Concerning the Queenes Maieſties prerogatiue royall, which he would gladly oppone againſt the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent of the people in Church-elections: Firſt, he could not be ignorant but that all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege that the Chriſtian magiſtrat as a principal member of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> where he is, ought to haue an intereſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> election anſwerable to his place, aſwel for aduiſe as conſent. Secondly, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme magiſtrate, according to the high
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:2079:23"/>
authority which God hath committed vnto him ouer all Churches in his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, both lawfully may &amp; by duety ought, not onely to diſanull what-ſoeuer election the Elders and people haue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully made, but alſo by his ciuil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence to compell them to make a newe election according to the Worde of God. Which, as it is as much as the ſole election by the Byſhop, giueth to the Prince, yea or rather more: ſo if they can ſhew any further thing due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Magiſtrate, all ſuch as with a ſincere minde, ſeeke for the reformation of the Church, are alwayes as readye with all humbleneſſe to giue it, as they will be willing with ſingleneſſe to ſhew it. To the place of the Councell of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odicea</hi> and <hi>Origin,</hi> let this be the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. The meaning of the Councell, in thoſe words, <hi>Non populo concedendum e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectionem facere, &amp;c. <hi>We ought not to giue leaue to the people to make ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi>
                  </hi> is, they ſhold not bear y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whol ſway without the gouernment or direction of the Elders, and not to ſhut out the due conſent of the people, as is manifeſt, by

the counſelles going afore, as ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after appeare, againſt which, this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell woulde not haue decreed, vnleſſe it had repealed the ſame or ſhewed ſome reaſon, but moſt of all by Counſelles fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, who haue authorized the conſent of the people: and namely, the 4. of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> which was confirmed in the ſixt generall Counſell at <hi>Trullum,</hi> together with that of <hi>Laodicia,</hi> which would not haue confirmed contrary decrees.

The next reaſon maketh as much againſt the election of Byſhops as of the people, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they may bee hypocrites as well as the people, &amp; in all mens iudgement one man is ſooner carried with ambition &amp;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:2079:24"/>
couetouſneſſe, then an whole Church of godly Elders, and Chriſtian people vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſorder. And if for the contentions &amp; ſtriuings of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> people, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church may abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the conſent of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people in Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical elections, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may ſhe by the ſame authority, diſanull Synods and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelles, which as often haue beene full of rage and vprores: and of which <hi>Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen</hi> ſaith, <hi>He neuer ſawe good iſſue, but that thorough merueilous ambition &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of contention, thinges out of order were not remedied but made worſe. <hi>Epiſt. 42. ad procopt.</hi>
                  </hi> Neither for this cauſe, as the promiſe of God made to counſels is not lightly to bee regarded, ſo ought hee not thus prophanely to reiect it when it is brought to vphold y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> conſent of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, Further, wher as he ſaith that Churches both of elder &amp; later times, haue for that cauſe abandoned ſuch elections, it is to be thought he can bring as much for the proofe of it, as hee hath already allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, which is nothing. Whatſoeuer hee can doe, the Doctrine of the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers, and the examples of the elder Churches is farre otherwiſe.

For <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> vpon Actes 1. aunſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Queſtion, why Peter commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated the election with the Diſciples, ſaith, <hi>Leaſt the matter ſhould be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a brawle, and haue fallen to a contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> For the elder Churches he cannot be ignoraunt, how many haue beene trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with ſuch inconueniences, and yet haue not ſought ſuch extream remedies; nay, the example of good <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperour is notable, who when the citizens of <hi>Nicodemia</hi> had choſen an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> a runnagate and a rayler on the Emperour, he did not take awaye the Churches conſent, but by his Letters according to his duety, mooued them to a newe. <hi>Theodoret lib. 1.

As concerning his queſtions following, which as they declare rather a mind gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to cauell at that which he cannot by ſound reaſon auoyde, ſo are they eaſilye aunſwered out of the courſe and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of trueth in the Scripture. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men not being in the ſeate of Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy are forbidden by the Apoſtle to ſpeak in ſuch publique aſſemblies, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe authority ouer men. Which rule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpoken of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> mother, doth alſo barre children and ſuch as ſhall bee in greater ſubiection, vntill by yeares and Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an knowledge, they ſhall by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, growe vnto the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Chriſtians in that behalfe: and then if they followe the greater and better part, their ſentence ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile. As for the Question of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, ſeeing it is a conſtitution not of God but of man, let the wiſe and ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full lawyers define, ſo they do no iuiury to the holie trueth of GOD and his Church. The next Queſtion is vayne and friuolous. For firſt, by due autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritye,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:2079:26"/>
diuers be propounded and the Church conſent to haue one of them, it muſt needes bee, that hee which is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued of the Elders and hath moſt voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, muſt receiue the charge, ſeeing that can not be ſayde to be done with gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall conſent (which thing the Scripture giueth to Church-elections) where the feweſt, but where the moſte directed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, do agree. And as for them that be abſent, ſicke, or imployde, if they haue any thing of waight to ſignify to the Church, the Church is to harken vnto them by whome ſoeuer they ſende their aduiſe. And as it is no reaſon that when eyther ſickneſſe or theire duetie to the Church, doe withhold them that ſhoulde abridge that libertie: ſo if by negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or wilfulneſſe, they bee abſente after competent warning, the whole Churche is not to depend vppon them, who doe not ſo much looſe as caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye theire intereſt in the election. Laſtly, who ſeeth not that anye idle brayne may make theſe and ſuch like demaundes, both againſt the rules in the Scriptures, and the obſeruation in
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:2079:26"/>
the primitiue Church. Where he ſayth, that, in the ſixth of the Actes, was not done by anie expreſſe commaundement of Chriſte, but vppon the mutinye of the Greekes agaynſt the Hebrewes: as it is to bee graunted, that it was an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion why the people did preſent, ſo, that was no cauſe of their free conſent, is manifeſt by the other places, where that is maintained without any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer cauſe, Actes 1. and Cap. 14. If Actes 6. ſpeake of Deacons onely, yet Actes 1. Actes 14. ſpeake of Apoſtles and Elders and theire election by the conſent of the people. And if the peoples conſent is not to be ſhut out in the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, which leſſe importeth their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye and ſaluation, much leſſe are they to be debarred in their Paſtors and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, vppon whome, as Peter ſayth, the flocke dependeth. Where hee ſayth the<note place="margin">1. Peter. 9.</note> people choſe without the Apoſtles, it is ſhewed already, howe his owne wordes checke him, and the trueth is plainly to bee ſeene in the Texte, that neyther the people without the Apoſtles direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, nor the Apoſtles without the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:2079:27"/>
people conſenting vnto them, made that Election. As for ſhutting out of the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Church-gouernours it is mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile why hee ſhoulde feare it, vnleſſe iealouſy which is fearefull where no feare is, hath blinded his eyes. That of the Apoſtles doing without any expreſſe worde from Chriſtes commaundement, is aunſwered before in that alleadged concerning the Saboth Cap. 1. and is further manifeſt by the example of the Apoſtle Paule, who beeing not with the other Apoſtles, yet followed that rule, Acts 14. That he ſaith, there is no certaine forme of their Election: hee is refuted by his owne wordes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where he ſheweth out of the Text, their election to haue beene of this ſort, that vppon the inſtruction of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles the people in preſenting them, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily therewithall gaue their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as the Apoſtles did in accepting them to their ordination. As for agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all Churches in all circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this point, he hath his aunſwere before, but that he willeth to be ſhewed what is ordinary, and what is extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:2079:27"/>
His aunſwere is, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles inſtructed the people, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, which is ordinary, as appeareth in that it is kept in all Elections of the Church, Actes 1. Actes 14. and 2. Cor. 9. 19. but that which was extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, was the preſentation of the people, the ſpecial cauſe whereof him ſelfe hath declared out of the text. In the reſt, it is ſtraunge, that hee requireth reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation where there is no repugnaunce, but all the places ioyne hande in hande together. For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> election of the Apoſtle, it lay in the liberty of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, onely to chooſe ſome. For the Lot bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the voyce of God, was to aſſigne which of them ſhould bee the Apoſtle: and this circumſtance maketh ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the trueth which is mayntayned. For, if where God is to ſtrike the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall ſtroke, yet the peoples conſent is to bee taken as farre as may bee; howe muche more is the authoritye of the whole Church to be ſought for, where the Election is onelye to bee done by men as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh Galat. 1. The obiection of the manner of the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:2079:28"/>
election, Actes 6. is aunſwered before. As for the number of 7. who is ſo ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as not to knowe that the number is to be varied, according to the ſpreade and greatneſſe of the Churches where they are: and the multitude of cauſes &amp; affayres to be dealt withall? As for no impoſition of handes in the firſt and 14. of the Actes, it is too ſimple and ſcarſe tollerable in a catechiſt, ſeeing ſuch thinges are to be gathered out of other places: otherwiſe one may thinke there were no praiers in the celebrating of the Communion, Acts 20. becauſe there is no mention of it in that place which yet were very abſurd, conſidering that the order which S. Luke deſcribed in the Churche at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> prooueth that<note place="margin">Actes. 2. 42.</note> they continued in breaking of bread and praier. And if ſuch ſeely obiections need to bee aunſwered, as inforcing diuers formes of elections, then alſo wee may proue diuerſities of Communions, ſome of the cup and bread together, ſome of the cup alone, ſome of breade alone, by Act. 2. Act. 20. 1. Cor. 12. Wher he ſaith Titus only is willed to appoint prieſts,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:2079:28"/>
belike the Jeſuites tranſlation was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, when he tranſlated <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous;</hi> Prieſtes and that ſo dazeled his eyes, that hee coulde not conſider the wordes following, that he ſhoulde do as hee had ſet him an order, which was not to do it without the conſent of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> church, except Paul would lift vp Titus aboue himſelfe &amp; Barnabas, who choſe Elders by voices. And if the anſwerer had bene<note place="margin">Actes. 15.</note> ignorant of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vſe of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſcripture, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes giueth y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> action to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> principal directer, which yet belongeth to many more, as Paule in one place ſaith, Tim. receiued grace by the laying on of his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des: 2. Tim. 6. (which in 1. Tim. 4. he declareth to haue beene done by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> laying on of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> handes of the Elderſhip) yet his ſkil in Logick ſhould haue ſhewed him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> deceit of this Sophiſm. Titus appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Elders, therefore he appoynted the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without the conſent of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people. Of this kind are al the reaſons following: As: al reformed Churches iumpe not in al cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtaunces, therefore they ſhut out the conſent of the people. In other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the Elders of euery congregation
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:2079:29"/>
haue the chiefe directio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the electione yet not without the conſent of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, therfore it is fitly according, to their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ordered, that the Church ſhoulde once for all, gyue vp their intereſt into one mans handes, for the continual elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many Churches. The ſentence of Maiſter <hi>Beza</hi> doth very fitly require an vpright conſcience, to ſet down what is expedient, according to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of time and place. Which if it had beene found in him at this time, and in this matter, he would not haue ſhut his eies, againſt the manifeſt light of words going before, which declare manyfeſtly that it is a perpetuall and vnchaungea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble poynt in Church-elections, which neither Church nor magiſtrate may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that they be made with the conſent of the people. His wordes in that place are theſe: <hi>Then therefore, not in Churches buylded vp, muſt all thinges be committed vnto the ſuffrages of the multitude, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet are the Paſtours to be choſen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent of the whole Church: But all thinges are ſo to be moderated of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Christian Magiſtrates, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:2079:29"/>
                  <hi>they bring in tyrannie into the Church, (which ſurely ſhould be done, if they ſhoulde call any vnto publike function of their owne wil, neglecting the conſent of the multitude, neither that the popular ſtate of the Church degenerate into popular rule.</hi> Neither are theſe wordes of <hi>Beza,</hi> onely ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſhew his corruption, but the title of the chap. where he taketh this obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, doth miniſter ſufficient aunſwere, ſeeing it declareth that <hi>Beza</hi> in all that place, ſpeaketh not of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the people, which he made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall in the chap. before, but of the maner how he gaue their voyces, which is but a circumſtaunce. And thus much both generally and particularly, for the vnfolding of his vnfit and ſlender alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations. Now followeth a confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the trueth it ſelfe, which is. It is ſubſtantiall &amp; vnchaungeable in church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elections, that they be made by the body of euery Churche, the Elders di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the people, and them-ſelues to giue their free conſent. The reaſons of which aſſertion are theſe. Firſt, what ſoeuer are the wayes of the Apoſtles in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2079:30"/>
ordinary Church-gouernement that is thus to be followed, that which they did ordinarily &amp; vnchangeably, is ordinarily &amp; vnchangeably to be done, that which they did vpon circumſtances, when thoſe circumſtances fall out, as appeareth by theſe places 1. cor. 4. 17. <hi>Which ſhall put you in reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>brance of my wayes in Chriſt, as I teach euery where in euery Church.</hi> And 1. Cor. 11. 2. <hi>I praiſe you brethren, that you remember me in all thinges, &amp; hold faſt the ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces as I deliuered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto you.</hi> And Phi. 4. 9 <hi>Which you haue learned &amp; recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, &amp; heard &amp; ſeene in me, thoſe things do, &amp; the God of peace be with you.</hi> 2. Tim. 3. 10. <hi>But thou haſt ſtep by ſtep attained vnto (or fully known) my doctrine, &amp; courſe, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, faith, long-ſuffering, loue, patience, &amp;c.</hi> Tit. 1. 5. <hi>Appoint Elders as I haue ſet thee an order.</hi> 1. Tim. 3. 17. <hi>Theſe thinges haue I written, that thou maiſt know how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue thy ſelfe in the howſe of God.</hi> Now that theſe were the vnch hangeable waies of the Apoſtles in elections, is cleare by the examples which haue been touched before. For in the 1. of the Actes, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles by Peter directing the action, &amp;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:2079:30"/>
in the ſixt by him or ſome other (for they could not al direct &amp; ſpeak at once) what ſoeuer were the variable circumſtaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they kept this inuiolable, that they people woulde giue their conſent in the election: And in the 14, chap. ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtaunces ceaſing, they obſerued this thing inuiolable <hi>Katapolin,</hi> Church by Church. Secondly, If it were not y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for a temporary charge to haue praiſe in the Goſpell thorowe all the Churches,: but as the Apoſtle ſayth, ſuch a one was alſo choſen by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Churches, to be a fellow with him-ſelfe, in carying the liberality of the Churches: then much leſſe can it be ynough in a perpetuall charge of ſuch waight vnto the Church, to depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the iudgement of one or many with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent of the Church: but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt is true. 2. cor. 8. 19. therefore the ſecond. Thirdly, if in euerye matter of great waight and importaunce, belonging to the whole body of the Church, whether ſeuerally in one particuler congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or ioyntly in many, the conſent of the people by the whole courſe of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gouernment,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:2079:31"/>
in the obſeruation of the Apoſtles was requyred, then the ſame is to be kept in this action, which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the particuler Church and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon aſſemblye as much as anye other. Now that the peoples co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſent was ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quyred, is euident by this induction fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. So <hi>Peter</hi> yeeldeth an account to them of the circumciſion, of his going into the Gentiles, and ſatiſfieth them before the Church. Acts. 11. 2. 18. The Church ſent foorth <hi>Barnabas</hi> to <hi>Antio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia,</hi> ver. 22. The churches of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> Actes 15. ſent <hi>Paule</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> about the controuerſie of Circumciſion. And when they came to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> they were receiued by the Church, and of the Apoſtles and Elders verſ. 4. And after the Apoſtles and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders had come togeather to looke to that matter, and had diſcuſſed the ſame: then it ſeemed good to the Apoſtles and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, with the whole Church, to ſende choſen men of their owne companye to <hi>Antiochia</hi> with <hi>Paule</hi> and <hi>Barnabas:</hi> then they wright the decree vnto the churches after this maner: <hi>The Apoſtles,</hi>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:2079:31"/>

They ſay: <hi>Although it be due high commendation in a prelate to be able to teach, as the Apoſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore noteth, yet al ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not haue the like grace therein, &amp; it is often recompenſed by other ſinguler giftes no leſſe neceſſary.</hi> He ſaith, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the aptnes to teach, is an high &amp; eminent <hi>Idaea</hi> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Apoſtle, rather declaring what
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:2079:39"/>
is requiſite in a Miniſter, then what is neceſſarily required. They ſay, <hi>ſome times and countries, require more preaching then others.</hi> He ſaith, vnpreaching Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are fitt for ſmall Congregations, though not for populous and troubleſom people. In all which, let the reader mark whether the Jeſuits be not one ſtep ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer the trueth then he. Now, although this be bee ſufficent to bewray the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerers halting: yet becauſe a great muſter of faint Souldiers is thought to bee a mighty armye, till being incoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered withall, they bee ſeuerally ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and put to flight: it is neceſſary to meet euery one of this valiant hoſt, hand to hand. And firſt, we ouerthrowe his <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea,</hi> which ſerueth for nothing elſe, but to ſet out the holy Cannons of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle to the laughter of all prophane men, by theſe reaſons following.</p>
               <p>1 Whatſoeuer the Apoſtle inferreth vpon the worthy worke of a Byſhop or Miniſters office, as that which muſt be in him for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> neceſſity of that work, or for the neceſſary adorning of it, the ſame cannot be ſuch an <hi>Idaea:</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:2079:39"/>2 But the Apoſtle hauing ſaide, that hee that deſireth a Biſhoppes charge, deſireth a worthy worke; thereon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth:</p>
               <p>3 Therefore, he muſt be apt to teach. Wherefore ſeing he ſayth, <hi>Dei einai di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacticon,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, he muſt be apt to teach, how dare he ſay it is onely good and requiſit, or an <hi>Idaea,</hi> which a Miniſter cannot at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto? for if he can not be ſo apt to teach, as is there required; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, he muſt not be apt to teach, ſeeing in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gouernment of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Church, a man muſt not be y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he cannot be, althogh in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of God his Lawe, which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to ſhew man his ſinne, and that man could fulfill the ſame, yet in the rules of the church-gouerment, it is farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, which are ſet downe for a directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Church in their triall, who are fit to ſuch or ſuch offices. Secondly, if that property of being apt to teache, bee an <hi>Idaea,</hi> (that is an imagination which cannot be reached vnto) then to be ſober, to be <hi>Coſmios,</hi> that is, comely in attire, to bee no fighter, are ſo likewiſe, ſeeing that is not onely bounde vp by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle

               <p>1 It is ſimply vnlawful, to admit ſuch to be Miniſters of the Sacramentes, which the Lord reiecteth from being Miniſters of the Sacrifices:</p>
               <p>2 But ſuch as are ſo vnapt to preach, as by that meanes the people lacke

               <p>3 Therefore we ought much more to reiect them from the miniſtery of the Sacramentes; becauſe the ebbe of knowledge vnder the law, ought to be full Sea vnder the goſpell. Thirdly,</p>
               <p>1 If the Lorde in the ſcriptures of the new Teſtament, hath giuen no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to the ordinary Miniſters of the Word to adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but vnder the commandement of preaching the Worde, then is it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to admit a Miniſter not apt to teach:</p>
               <p>2 But hee is not able to ſhewe any one place of a commaundement of an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary miniſtry of the Sacraments, not comprehended vnder the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the preaching Miniſtery:</p>
               <p>3 Therefore vnleſſe he would bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods harueſt ſuch an one as he hath not hyred, it is ſimply vnlawfull to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte him to adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which cannot preach.</p>
               <p>If he obiect theſe words of Chriſt, <hi>Do this:</hi> we anſwere, that it is not to be

referred onely to the deliuery of breade, but to al the actions going afore of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, bleſſing, and breaking, &amp;c, and therefore the Apoſtle ſayth, that when we adminiſter the Lordes Supper, we preach Chriſts death till he come. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,<note place="margin">1.

Act. 14. 21. 22. 23. So in the old Teſtament, when for y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſins of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> work of preaching was rare &amp; precious; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophets of God ſent not forth reading &amp; vnlearned Leuites, but rather gathered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> on y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſaboths &amp; new-moons, to be inſtructed of

them. 2. King. 4. 22. and in this ſenſe and no other, is the conſtitution of the French Church to be taken, ſeeing they make no mention of the Sacramentes, but of Prayer and Exhortations, which in another manner may bee done with due caution of priuate perſons in priuat aſſemblies. Which thing, if it were ſo carried of the Apoſtles in their times of perſecution and troubles, howe much more oughte it to bee among vs in the time of peace: where beſide the dayly increaſe of preaching Miniſters, if thoſe already which we haue, may be ſuffered freely to execute their office, matters may be ſo ordered (till thorough the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God all Churches bee repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,) that no man neede to goe aboue fiue myle to heare a ſermon: and for the adminiſtration of the Sacramentes, the Church with the conſent of the Godly Magiſtrates may take ſuch order, (if it ſhall ſo pleaſe them) that euerye Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh may haue the Sacramentes mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred by a preaching Miniſter, and ſo they maye bee ſtill edified in the holy fayth, and not as hee groſely and vngod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye

For as one wel beate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, leaueth him that maſtereth him and turneth to ſome eaſier match, in ſteede of proouing out of the Scriptures, that reading of the word is ordinarily ſo honoured, that it ſhould bee an ordinary inſtrument to worke fayth; hee prooueth by many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture a cleane other thing: namely, that the reading of the Worde receiueth ſome other bleſſing then that which is extraordinary, which euerye one will graunte him. For they are no ſmall bleſſinges, that by publique rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding &amp; priuate exerciſe of the word, men are prepared &amp; made fit for the publike miniſtry: and afterwards are continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quickned in al Chriſtian holines, and confirmed in the publike doctrine, which is al the ſence of the places which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth. And it is as if one ſhold reaſon: <hi>Apollo</hi> watered y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

Neither doth he in any ſort ſatiffie that which is obiected out of the Apoſtle, Rom. 10. ſeeing hee ſpeaketh of ſuch Preachers as are publikely and ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent. verſe 15, which we hope he will not vnderſtande of bare reading, and of ſuch as the Prophet Eſaie, with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the bleſſing of the Goſpel cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out: <hi>How beautifull are the feete of</hi>

Further, if he had remembred that the Apoſtle maketh ſo great a difference between his owne writing &amp; preaching: as when he writeth to the Romanes, he deſireth earneſtly to preach vnto them alſo: he need not haue maruailed if good men make ſuch ſeperation between the reading of good writinges of men, &amp; the liuely preaching of the holye worde of God: eſpecially conſidering he can not be ignoraunt, that the one proceedeth onely from the common gyftes of the

For the examples of Aaron and Peter were without the compaſſe of the ordinarye power of the Church, who beeing immediatelye called of God, coulde not be demiſſed by the Church. For ſeeing no calling can bee made voyde, but by the authority which made it, that which hath immediately proceeded from God, can not be repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led but by his voyce. Now ſeeing the immediat voyce of God and Chriſt, did not onely not make voyde, but further e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh the calling of Aaron and Peter: how could y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church meddle with that?

And if this be not playne i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to cauſe him to ſee the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which is as greate, as that which is betweene GOD and his Churche, the voyce of man, and the voyce of GOD: Let him vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande it by an other example of lyke reaſon. It hath beene proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued alreadye, both by the Scriptures and Fathers, that none ſhoulde be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Miniſtery by the Church, but ſuch as were ſufficiently qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ordinary meanes, or gyftes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them alreadye of God vnto the ſame function.

But rather as the ordinary power of the Church can not heerein imitate the Lordes prerogatiue, becauſe they
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:2079:50"/>
can not, as God with their calling powre in gyftes into the perſonnes, whereby they ſhoulde bee inabled to their office: So they muſte not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the prerogatiue of GOD in this, becauſe they are rather to bee gealouſe and ſuſpicious for the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſake (though other-wyſe they are bound to hope the beſte of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunt Sinner) ouer him, leaſte he ſhoulde agayne betraye the cauſe of GOD; which in God is farre other-wyſe, who not onelye knoweth the heartes of men, but alſo what ſtrength he will after gyue him: and if hee let him fall, hee knoweth how to tourne it to the profitte of his Church. Now, as theſe examples in this reſpecte approche not vnto the matter in debate. So the example of <hi>AVGVSTINE</hi> a Manachie or ſuch lyke, becauſe the queſtion is not of ſuch as were before their miniſterye ſuch, or carryed away with the common ignoraunce before they knew the trueth: but of ſuche as firſte ſeruiuge GOD in his

               <p>3 Wherefore this order muſt be kept holy and vndefiled.</p>
               <p>We know it will be obiected, that theſe commaundementes be in the olde Teſtament, not in the new: and that they are ceremoniall. They who ſhall ſo obiect, muſt conſider the old Teſtament is of equal authority with the new, and therefore ſeeing God hath once eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed this law for the Church-miniſtery, they muſt not repeale it but by the ſame authoritie, vnleſſe they will make with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Manichees, one iuſt God for the law, and an other mercifull for the Goſpel: So that vnleſſe it maye be ſhewed, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that this law was onely a ſhadowe for a tyme to come, or was made for ſome cauſe peculier for that tyme and thoſe perſons (which they can not doe, becauſe of the perpetuall equityes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aſſigned): It followeth, that this

muſt ſtande for an holy and induring conſtitution of God. And in trueth ſuch aunſwere vndermineth at once, both the glorye and perfection of God his holy Scriptures, not onelye in our iudgement, but in the iudgement of all wryters, holy and prophane, who haue continually alleadged the ſentences, and commaundementes of the olde Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, euen for the matters of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the Church.

If this exception ſerue, howe ſhall we any longer with the Fathers and Godly wryters of our age, ſtoppe

Nay, that they maye ſee they can not vndermyne the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſte with ſuch aunſwers, but they muſt alſo ſhake the brazen Pyllers of the Sacred authoritye of the Magiſtrate: Let them ſhew with what Argumentes they can ſtoppe the Mouthes of Papyſtes in maintay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Supreame authoritie of the Prince, and our moſte gratious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, to reforme religion, according to Gods word: to plant Church-officers by the rules of the ſame, and according there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto to depoſe Abiather, and ſet vp Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotk, to call ſynodes Eccleſiaſtical when need is, or when the Church-gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours neglect their dutye, other then by the examples of Ezechias, Solomon Jehoſhaphat, Joſias, and by the preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant reaſons drawn from them.

His firſt reaſons are drawne from the inconueniences, which hee thinketh will come vnto the Church by this means, as requiring ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (like a Ciuilian not a diuine) what is ſafe, then what is according to God his wil: Amongſt which, he demaundeth whether the Authour had not rather be vnder the forme that nowe is, then vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the infinite dictatorſhip of his owne miniſter? which I aunſwere by another Queſtion: why ſhould the miniſters cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures proceeding by the equall authority of an Elderſhip, vpon cauſes determined by God his worde in a ſmall volume, be more infinite then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Commiſſaries, who
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:2079:59"/>
cannot but proccede according to the infinite and contradictorye Canons of their Law, who can excommunicate vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on non apparaunce for a matter, of 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pence. Is it liker that one Miniſter ſhal haue many elders more tied to his wil &amp; pleaſure, then one Commiſſary his own affections: Againe, may not their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale from one Elderſhip, to a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or aſſemblie of many Miniſters and Elderſhips, be as ſafe as from the Commiſſary to another Byſhop? And if it were granted that the Byſhop ſhould haue authoritye in euerye particuler Churche: yet with the Miniſters con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent (vnleſſe he will iuſtle one lawe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another) why were it not more reaſonable &amp; ſafe, then as it is nowe in the Byſhoppe alone: Seeing then the Miniſter might haue more particuler knowledge of the cauſes in his Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation then the Byſhop, and yet if hee were raſh, the Byſhops wiſedome might ſtay him. And if the Byſhoppe ſhoulde ſuſpende the Miniſter vppon abuſe of his authoritye, yet hee were not at the ſame poynt he was before, becauſe then
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:2079:59"/>
they which did not abuſe their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritye, mighte exerciſe it ſtill. And if the Byſhoppe dwell in the Pariſh and had preheminence, yet hee ſhoulde not draw the execution of Diſcipline to himſelfe onely, but to holde it in common with him. But what doe I anſwering his cauelles agayuſte the Lawe, ſeeing I doubt not but the <hi>Abſtractor</hi> will ſoone aunſwere his cauill in this behalf. For the fountayns which are in his Booke already, are not yet dammed vp by the anſwerer: Wherefore, I paſſe to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenience, which he fetcheth from the want of diſcretion in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Miniſter, which is; <hi>What if hee vpon want of diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doe excommunicate ſome greate peere of his Pariſh vppon ſome ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mized cauſe, whoſe indignation may turne the whole church to great miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheefe?</hi> To this I anſwere, that vnleſſe the Byſhops ſeat aboue a Paſtors, be ſo ſanctified (as <hi>Hierome</hi> ſayth) by humain conſtitutions, as that it can alwaies proceede with diſcretion and Wiſdome, when the Paſtors ſeate ſanctified with God, and ordained with ſo many preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

promiſes, ſhoulde bee ſubiect to more follye and headineſſe, then the chayre of the Byſhoppe: this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience is as likelye to fall into the Byſhoppe as the Miniſter. Further, whether is more likely, that the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop hauing by reaſon of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce and Ciuill authoritye, bothe more heart-burning betweene the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Counſailers and himſelfe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in leſſe feare, as thinking him ſelfe better able to ſhoulder amongeſt them, would be more bold in his conceit, then a poore Miniſter (as hee calleth him) who neuer woulde for feare, but vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on moſte neceſſary and ſufficient cauſe vrged in conſcience, aduenture ſuche thing? neither if hee woulde, could many graue Elders, without whom he coulde do nothing, bee drawne vnto it, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſidering; that their feare woulde preuayle, where greate Conſcience of theire duetie ſhoulde not ouercome it. And maye not this man when his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion as a Canker ſhall frette ſo farre, turne all this agaynſt the euery of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique rebuking, aſ-well as agaynſte

If hee ſuſpende the Miniſter from prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge: whether hee bee not at the ſame poynte hee was before? And what if the Miniſter vppon ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion woulde rebuke openlye ſome Peere of the Realme, vpon bare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyte, or ſome ſurmiſe: ſhall then the duetye of the Miniſter in Preaching for ſuche vnitye of the Churche ceaſe and bee counted inconuenient? If hee ſaye no, this is the commaundemente of GOD, and neceſſarye for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian inſtitution: ſo wee ſaye, this is the commaundemente of JESUS CHRISTE, and neceſſarye for holye correction.

In the next, to blear mens eyes with all, he graunteth they may rebuke in publike doctrine, bynde and looſe by preaching, which is a great part of Diſcipline: as though any man were ſo blynd, (as when the booke ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth three partes of the Miniſters Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice miniſtring of doctrine, miniſtering of the Sacraments, and miniſtring of Diſcipline) as not to ſee what violence he doth; Nay, what folly he imputeth to the booke, as though they ſhoulde make three of two. For if Diſcipline be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the open rebuking in prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,

and binding and looſing by the ſame, that beeing a parte of miniſtring the Doctrine by preaching, is manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contained vnder it: and ſo not onelye maketh one two, but carrieth one halfe from one end of the ſentence to another, placing a thirde betweene, and for an vmpier belike, leaſte they ſhoulde fall out, or elſe being ioyned orderly togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhould to much annoy him. But his reaſons, which the Jeſuites haue ſhaken againſt the trueth hefore him, do follow. Unto which I aunſwere, that it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, that if the Apoſtle mighte by ſole authority excommunicate, therefore the Byſhop may: for an Apoſtle is of far greater authority then a Byſhop is.

               <p>2 But he maketh the Doctor (in that reckoning) a diſtinct member, hauing a diſtinct action from all the reſt, to wit, teaching diſtinguiſhed there from exhortation, from gouerning, from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributing:</p>
               <p>3 Wherefore it is plaine, that he is a Church-officer, ordinary and perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all (for his giftes and vſe are ordinary and perpetuall) and alſo diſtinguiſhed from the Paſtor.</p>
               <p>1 Whatſoeuer Chriſte hath giuen to his Church, with an ordinary and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall gift, for the perpetual work of the miniſtery, gathering and building vp of the Church vnto perfection, that is an ordinary Church-officer:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:2079:66"/>2 But ſo he hath giuen Paſtours and Doctors. Epheſ. 4. 11.</p>
               <p>3 Therefore both are perpetuall, and ordinary officers, and by conſequent diſtinct.</p>
               <p>Unto this argument, they obiect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apoſtle hauing ſayde, ſome A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtes, he ſaith in the laſt place, ſome <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Teachers,</hi> which becauſe they are coupled by <hi>and,</hi> they ſay they are one and not diſtinct.

               <p>1 Whatſoeuer is ſet as Church-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer in the Church by God, with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and proper ordinary gift, that is ſuch as we haue aboue deſcribed:</p>

Nowe, if hee conſider either the order which we maintaine out of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or that which is practized in al re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, he ſhal find, that they<note place="margin">Actes. 14.

it is moſte falſe, who can chuſe, but hee muſt abhorre the hypocriſy of theſe men, who can deface the ordinance of God, which they want, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues haue not. For their Commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Chauncellors, who ſuſpende, Excommunicate, and adminiſter the diſcipline of our Church vnder the By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, what are they? who calleth them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Byſhop: who ordaineth them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynteth them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Letters Patentes: By whoſe prayers doe they looke to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine comfort in their calling? by the byſhops bleſſings without prayer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out faſting.

Wherfore, althogh this were ſufficient to ſtop his prophane mouth: yet that it may appeare that the gray haires of this order, are more auncient then the very hoarie head of his Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors and commiſſaries: I will prooue it to be the ordinaunce of GOD out of the Scriptures, that there ought to bee an Eccleſiaſticall Senate of Paſtors, Doctors and Elders gouerning onely, to haue the adminiſtration of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matters, and that they ought to bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred Eccleſiaſtically.</p>
               <p>1 If the Apoſtles ſet downe two ſorts<note place="margin">1. Reaſon.</note> of Elders which rule the Church wel, and are worthy of double honor: the one ſort of them only ruling, the other labouring alſo in the Worde and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2079:71"/>
doctrine (which are as hath beene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued before the Paſtors and Doctors); then it is plaine that theſe raiſing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muſt be added vnto them:</p>
               <p>2 But the firſt is true by the expreſſe wordes of the Apoſtle. 1. Tim. 5. 17.</p>
               <p>3 Therefore the former aſſertion is certaine.</p>
               <p>To this place ſome are wont to obiect that the firſt ſort are ſuch as are occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Word and Sacraments, thogh they preach not. But this will not ſerue, both becauſe we haue prooued that none are to be admitted to that, but they ought to preach, and alſo becauſe thoſe ſhoulde yet be occupyed in the Worde, and therefore comprehended vnder the latter ſort. Now, when they perceiue this will not ſerue (beeing men willing to learne of anye) they haue learned of the Jeſuites to aunſweare, <hi>That ſuch</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ieſuites Teſtament Rheimes.</hi> 1. Tim. 5. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Prieſts ſpecially and Prelates, are worthy of duble, that is more ample honour, that are able to teach and preach, and do take paines therein.</hi> And therefore they make, that all for their office, are worthy of double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: but ſpecially thoſe which labour
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:2079:71"/>
diligently and painfully in the Worde.<note place="margin">D. Cop. ſer. lat. in con.</note> But this ſhift is manifeſtly diſcouered by the text. Firſt, becauſe the Apoſtle ſhoulde then haue ſaid thus: they which are occupyed in Word and doctrine, are worthy of double honor, eſpecially thoſe which labour: but he doth not make the miniſtery of word and doctrine common to both, but the miniſtery of gouerning. Secondlye, the Apoſtle by theſe mens goodly deuice, ſhoulde not proceede, but ſhould go backwarde in his compariſon: for he had then ſayde more in the firſte part, when he ſayd, <hi>They which do it well: or (as he might ſaye) with worthineſſe of praiſe,</hi> which he that doth, muſt not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do it with labour, paines, &amp; diligence,<note place="margin">Calos.</note> but alſo with purity, wiſdome, zeale, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dnes, fitnes, &amp; many other things beſides labour. So this ſenſe cleane ouerthroweth the Apoſtles increaſe by the worde <hi>Eſpecially.</hi> Thirdly, by this meanes the Apoſtle muſte make three ſortes of Miniſters of the worde, ſuch as are occupied in the Word, but not well, (belike their ignoraunt Miniſters). Firſt, they which ſhoulde haue ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:2079:72"/>
for their office ſake, then ſome that doe it well, but not with labour or dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, which muſt haue double honour though they labour not; &amp; the laſt, which doe it more then well, which muſt haue more then double honour. If this be not to dally with the Lordes word, what is? Fourthly, If the difference were not in thinges wherein they are occupied, but in the labour aboue others, or the ſlouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full labouring of others, this difference ſhould be none at all, ſeeing the Apoſtle in other places giueth watchfulneſſe, which is more then labour, for it is a<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 17.</note> continuaunce of labour, with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, not onely in preaching, but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for their ſoules health. Yea, he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth this very word, <hi>Copio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes, which labor, to all that are ouer them in the Lord, and</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Theſ. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>admoniſh them, which they muſt reuerence and acknowledge.</hi> Laſtly, their diſtinction and interpretation is cleane deſtitute of conference of Scriptures, which are not wont to giue double honor to any but to thoſe which are painfull, &amp; which labor in their worke: but ours haue moſte ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt witnes out of other places, as ſhall
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:2079:72"/>
appeare by the other reaſons following.</p>
               <p>1 If the Apoſtle Rom. 12. ſetting<note place="margin">2. Reaſon.</note> downe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ordinary members of Chriſts Church, which differ in their proper action, doe ſet downe the Elder to be ouer the people with diligence, and not to be occupied in the miniſtery of the Worde, eyther by exhortation or doctrine, <hi>but to admoniſh them</hi> and rule<note place="margin">1. Theſ. 5.</note> them: then our aſſertions muſt needes be certain:</p>
               <p>2 But the firſt is manifeſt. Rom. 12. 6. 7. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3 Therefore this hath beene ordained by the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>1 If the Apoſtle ſay in the 1. cor. 12.<note place="margin">3. Reaſon.</note> that beſides the Miniſters of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Word, God hath ſet in his Church, <hi>Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi> then our Poſition is true:</p>
               <p>2 But he ſayth, God hath ſet firſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, Thirdlye, Teachers, Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors. &amp;c:</p>
               <p>3 Wherefore our Doctrine is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, but the liuely trueth of God his Worde.</p>
               <p>Unto theſe two they doe obiecte, that by theſe, Magiſtrates are meant,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:2079:73"/>
but that is plainelye confuted by theſe reaſons oute of the Text. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of them as of Church-Officers, and which were<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 6. 1. Cor. 12. 13. 14. 27.</note> then the members of Chriſtes bodye, which then theire Magiſtrates were not. Secondlye, he ſpeaketh of them as of ſuch giftes as came then newly by preaching of the goſpel to the Gentiles, and ſuch as they ſhould then with zeale followe after. Rom. 12. 6. 1. Cor. 12. 31. Which the Apoſtles would neyther ſay nor exhort them to doe concerning the Magiſtrates office, for they neuer were ſo Annabaptiſtical, as to exhorte theire churches to be zealous, to become Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates. Thirdly, the Apoſtle doth after ſpeake of the Magiſtrates and their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and of the churches duetye to them. Rom. 13. Laſtly, the Gouernours wee ſpeake of, in their gouerment are placed as farre vnder the Paſtors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as they are vnder the Apoſtles and Prophetes, which if they dare ſay it of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Magiſtrates they are them-ſelues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come plaine Annabaptiſts, and do cleane ouerthrow the moſt rightfull ſoueraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:2079:73"/>
of Princes ouer all perſons and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as well Ciuill as Eccleſiaſticall. A fourth reaſon is, ſeeing oure Sauiour Chriſt, in ſetting downe the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Preſbytery, ſpeaketh according to the Jewes, for otherwiſe the Apoſtles could not haue vnderſtood him, when he ſayde, tell the congregation or Churche, which was the title then giuen vnto the<note place="margin">1. Cor. 13. 2. 9 <hi>Beza on this place.</hi>
                  </note> Eccleſiaſticall Senate, and his wordes of hauing as a Publican and Heathen, doth manifeſtly prooue he ment to ſpeak according to their cuſtome: It muſt needes be that hee did according to the places afore brought, ordayne a Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of Paſtors, Teachers, and Elders,<note place="margin">Marke. 15. 1.

                  <hi>matters of God,</hi> and <hi>ſome for ciuill cauſes, the matters of the king.</hi> Now, the cauſe of this which <hi>Danaeus</hi> ſpeaketh of was, that in waighty matters both came together, becauſe the politike lawes of the Jewes were for the moſte part defined and ſet downe in the Worde of God, they, the Prieſt, Leuites, and Eccleſiaſticall El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, were there to pronounce the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence Eccleſiaſtically: that is, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſenſe of Gods word in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cauſe: the Princes, cheefe of the people, and ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil Senate, were to pronounce Ciuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and iudicially the ſentence of death, or ſuch like according to the ſenſe of the Scriptures. Secondly by the cauſes, that when the Eccleſiaſticall Senate commeth to the Ciuill, the matters are thus mixt, as Jeremy 26. 16. But when the matter is Ciuil meerely, and no Queſtion of the ſenſe of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, then it is of Magiſtrates onely:
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:2079:86"/>
as 1. chro. 28. 1. 1. chro. 13. 1. Or when the matters were meerely Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, then was the Eccleſiaſticall Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate onely brought together, as in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 2. king. 6. 32. As in matters to be done in the congregation. Act. 13. 15. For Excommunication John. 9. 22. 10. 40. For interpretation, the Prieſts and Leuites only, Math. 24. And laſtly by this, that Peter being before both the Senates Eccleſiaſticall and Ciuil, doth plainly diſtinguiſh them, calling y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one<note place="margin">Archontes tou laou.

                  <hi>the cheefe or rulers of Iſrael,</hi> the other <hi>the Elders of Iſrael.</hi> Wherefore this proueth not that they did exercize ciuill authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and although our lawes political, are not in this reſpect like vnto the Jewes, yet if the Magiſtrate will call the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip to declare the will of God, or pronounce duely an Eccleſiaſticall ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, when hee will pronounce a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, it may well be done without the confuſion he ſpeaketh of.

In the next poynt of counſels, there is no contrarietie betweene the admonition, and the French Churches order: <hi>For they</hi>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:2079:95"/>
                  <hi>ſay they may definitiuely define cauſes in a prouintiall Synode,</hi> (although I can not find thoſe wordes by his quotation): And the admonition ſaythe ſo, <hi>except there be a generall counſell, and they will haue it there.</hi> For there is no reaſon if they will order it fitly at hoam, to carry it to a generall counſell. And I pray are theſe two ſo contrary? They may ende it, and they may ende it, except they thinke it better to referre it to a generall counſel. In paſſing from this difference to the next, he ſetteth peremptorilie, that it is manyfeſt, that <hi>there is no certayne forme of electing Eccleſiaſticall officers vſed by the Apoſtles,</hi> but reaſon he ſheweth none whereby it maye appeare: So that if his Doctorſhip ſaye it, we muſte take it from him as vndoubtedly, as if he had it by reuelation. For confutation of which folly, we may ſay thus much: That ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Miniſters, examination is to be had, of knowledge, of doctrine, of ripe neſſe to expound the Scriptures, and in a worde of aptnes to teach; it is many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that as the gouerning of this action belongeth to the Elderſhip, and is to be
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:2079:95"/>
done with publike prayers, that beſides<note place="margin">Actes. 14.</note> the gouerning Elders there muſt be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, who maye be able throughly to iudge and examine, to conceiue publike prayer, and to deliuer to the Church by doctrine, exhortation, whatſoeuer is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient in this caſe. Which thing is euident, not onely by the perpetuall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it, but alſo by the conſtant and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaungeable practiſe of the Apoſtles, in the firſt of the Actes, in the ſixth of the Acts, in the 14. in the 1. Tim. 3. of Tit. 1. Onely it is to be noted, that it is not committed to one, no not ſo much as to<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note> ordayne, much leſſe to elect, but the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination is by the Elderſhip. And Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy could not carry the matter away, but had a charge for his owne part, <hi>To keepe him-ſelfe pure, and not to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>with other mens ſinnes</hi> whatſoeuer o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Elders did in this caſe. Now, as this order is certayne and vnuariable, both in the reaſon and practiſe of it: ſo the circumſtaunces, whether it ſhall be by 6. or by 7. Miniſters: by a conference only, or by a ſynode (ſauing where it may be, the more the better) is left to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:2079:96"/>
of the church. Wherefore it is not only without reaſon, but alſo ſence, &amp; contrary to his profeſſed knowledge, to proclayme warre amongſt the Churches for this matter of circumſtaunce, when they all haue the ſubſtaunce, agreed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon in Gods worde, and doe not tye them-ſelues or others to the particuler circumſtaunces.

For if eyther by ſilence, or otherwyſe they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie their conſent, and the election be

In deed if at one mans pleaſure for truthes ſake, they be put out, to ſeeke an honeſt way to lyue is not vnlawfull, nor contrarye to the decree of the French Churches, that <hi>they be choſen to be Ministers their whole life, vnleſſe they be diſcharged lawfully,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which decree all agree.

In the nexte, when hee ſheweth who <hi>that ſome bee,</hi> which make deciſion of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies incident to euery Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, otherwiſe then if they can with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation agree of the trueth amongſt themſelues: we will giue his aunſwere to it: In the meane time we iudge of it as of the reſt: that it is, vntrue. The like of the two other (excepting <hi>Brown,</hi> for whome he hath his aunſwere) and of the next about God-fathers. Concerning the next poynt, the which he ſayth of the Churches of <hi>Fraunce,</hi> that they think it
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:2079:97"/>
lawfull <hi>to baptize without an aſſembly:</hi> I can not beleeue it, vnleſſe I haue better direction then the 7. article of their Diſcipline, in which I can finde no ſuch thing, though I finde ſome other arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles there, which he hath aledged thence: wherefore I feare that it is a fiction. Concerning Holy-dayes, let him firſte ſhew, that the Churches obſerue them in maner of a Sabboth, wholly to reſt from their labour, and then <hi>T. C.</hi> with his reaſons, or the churches with theirs, muſt giue place to the truth. The diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity about popiſh Prieſtes is aunſwered before in the tretiſe of that matter. The next are but ſlaunders, to which he gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth no credite by anye teſtimonye, and are confuted before in the treatiſe of the Doctor. It is alſo a manifeſt vntruth, that <hi>T. C.</hi> miſlyketh wholly <hi>That anye are ſuffered to preach nor hauing a Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall charge.</hi> For he ſpeaketh generally of ſuch as haue no charge, neither Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, nor Doctorall. For he would haue both tyed to a certayne place, yea the Elders Preaching in other mens cures or charges, wherevnto men are not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:2079:98"/>
called, wee condemne according to the iudgement of the French Churches neither doth he note any wher we might finde the contrarie. In ordaining of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, the admonition meaneth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than the Frenche Churches: for though the Elderſhippe abolliſhe thoſe which are vnprofitable, yet it may be don with conſent &amp; alowance of other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; for which cauſe hee entreateth of conferences page. 30. 31. &amp;c. That hee ſaith of the admonition, as though they miſliked a preſcript forme of prayer, is an vtter vntruth, for there are not anye wordes which ſhewe they miſlike a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript forme of prayers. As for <hi>vnleaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bread,</hi> it is but proper to <hi>Geneua</hi> onely, &amp; now our Church hath alowed the other: why ſhould he then make any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence or ſtrife about it? <hi>The matters of mariage or ſuch like heere named,</hi> as they are handled with vs are ciuil; but as they become doubtfull in any queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God his worde, or what is expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the Church to doe, for auoyding of offence, belongeth vnto the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall ſeigniorie: and ſo that diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:2079:98"/>
is aunſweared. In the other alſo it is defended, as vnlawfull for a Miniſter of the Worde, to be occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Ciuill affayres. Againſte this, he in vaine bringeth an exception in El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which rule onely. Neither is it ſimplye a Ciuill thing to giue teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in writinges for to doe it, for matters Eccleſiaſticall: as for ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of fayth, for aſſuring them to be receiued which were excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, or ſuch like, it is an Eccleſiaſtical, not a Ciuill action. Touching the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the French Church, for publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of Bookes, we conſent, that where the Diſcipline is eſtabliſhed and an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der taken, that men with modeſly in a Synode may be ſufficiently heard, and ſatiſfied, that it ought to be in force, and as an Eecleſiaſticall order obeyed; from which yet a man may ſwarue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dryuen to gyue defence to the truth of God. The next ſetteth his conceits in the laughter of all men. For maye we not miſlyke, that he which orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, ſhoulde bydde the ordayned, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue the holye Ghoſte, which he can
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:2079:99"/>
not gyue, nor hath promiſe that his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of handes ſhall diſtribute auye gifts, and yet <hi>alow that that place for inſtruction be repeated and intreaſed of?</hi> Concerning his long ſrory of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, this may be ſufficient ſhortly to aunſwere, both to ſhew our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Firſt therefore we ſay, that we haue alwayes beene readye, according to our dutye to ſubſcribe to her Maieſties ſupreame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and to the Articles of religion, concerning the doctrine of fayth and of the Sacramentes, which is all that is requyred by law. Secondly, when (as it is in Fraunce) the ſubſtaunce of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline ſhall be out of the worde confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and the controuerſies betweene vs equally and orderly decided: We will alſo be bounde to ſubſcribe as they are.

To the firſt we ſaye, Diſcipline, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching<note place="margin">1</note> the ſubſtaunce, is fully deſcribed out of the worde of God, in the booke of diſcipline, &amp; the treatiſe of eccleſiaſtical gouernment, and in the moſt of the ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt writers of our time. The ſecond is<note place="margin">2</note> anſwered, partly by the former, &amp; partly by this treatiſe. In ſteed of this we aſke him what be y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> writings which haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by the ſcripture, all thoſe foreſayd godly &amp; learned writings? To the third<note place="margin">3</note> we aunſwere, it is no ſounde diuinity to exclude Chriſtian Princes from their

gouerment in Church-matters. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Excommunication he hath his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere before. To the two other clawſes, let the Papiſts anſwere, for they are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiouſly imputed vnto vs. And we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund of him, whether it be ſound diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, that when the Prince will eate fleſh in Lent or do ſuch like, ſhee muſt haue a Diſpenſation from an Archby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop? And that the writes of his Courts euen in cauſes ciuill, and matters of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunce ſhould be in his owne name, and not in the name of her moſt excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſty? The fourth is aunſwered in the Treatiſe of the Elderſhip: And we aſke<note place="margin">4</note> of him what pregnant proofe he hath ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from ſcripture or Father, that Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Gouernment ſhoulde be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in a wholle Dioceſſe, by a Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celor or Commiſſarye beeing a meere lay-man? To the 5. and 6. both, wee<note place="margin">5. 6.</note> aunſwere: That rebaptization is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Worde of God, and that thoſe hee ſpeaketh of be maried folkes: And wee require him to prooue by the Worde of God, that in caſe of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity which they pretend, a Woman

may baptize: And to prooue by the ſame that men may be forbidden to mary in Lent or ſuch like times. The ſeuenth<note place="margin">7</note> is aunſwered in that to the 5. and 6. And we demaunde of him how they can prooue it lawfull to admit a Popiſh prieſt, fallen from the Goſpell and ſtill vnapt to teach? To the eyght we aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere,<note place="margin">8</note> there is the like reaſon of the Supper and of Baptiſme: And we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire him to prooue by the Worde of God, that a Deacon may baptize? and when he hath proued that, let him proue why hee may not miniſter the Supper alſo? To the ninth we anſwere, that to<note place="margin">9</note> the Miniſters, there may be diuerſity of rewardes giuen, ſo long as none haue to little, nor any too much. And we require him to prooue by the Word of God, that a Miniſter of the Goſpell may carry the pompe of men of eſtate. To the<note place="margin">10</note> tenth we aunſwere, as is ſet downe in the Treatiſe, that a Miniſter ſhould be apt to teach: We would haue him proue that any other may preache, who is not apt to teach. To the Eleuenth we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere<note place="margin">11</note> affirmatiuely, and require him to
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:2079:102"/>
prooue by the Scriptures, that an Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſhop may put Preachers to ſilence, for not ſubſcribing to that which is not required by the lawe. To the twelfth<note place="margin">12</note> we aunſwere: it is not lawfull for one to be thruſt out of his Miniſtery, for ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing modeſtly in his ſermons, the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience of vnleauened breade in the Lords Supper: that all vſury as wee ſpeake it, whither biting or nibbling is vnlawfull. And we require of him to prooue by the Worde of God, that it is tollerable to ſuffer Drunkardes, whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, ignoraunt men of occupation in the Miniſtry, and for not ſubſcribing (where Law doth not enforce it) or for the not vſing of ſome ceremonie to turne out godly learned Miniſters. And make a pitifull ſeperation of the Paſtor and the flocke. The Lorde giue vs to be of one minde, and wherein we agree, let vs proceede by the rule of loue.</p>
