            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

boast, either for royaltie of Gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or tranquilitie of yeeres: but at one time or other they haue felt the maligne stroke of Fortune, either by enuye of princely rule, ambitious desire of vnstable preferme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or some tragicall and wicked intent, issuing from the roote of all disloyaltie, Treason. In vaine it were to spend time in repetition of circumstau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, to make proofe either of the one or the other: our eyes are filled with the registred reportes heereof, and our eares made acquainted, with a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of vnhappy accidents, yea, the more my greefe to thinke thereon, our natiue Countrey hath lately witnessed, a Stratagem according with former infortunes. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though mallice, in diuers of these vngracious acts, had purposed and appointed a wished end of his bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy desire; yet notwithstanding his
<pb facs="tcp:13319:3"/>
extremest occasions, some one or other haue beene reserued, to giue warning of such mischeeuous and iminent daungers; where through, the Prince and People haue beene happily deliuered, and mallice alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vtterly disappointed. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of which true and loyall seruice, the faithfull perfourmers thereof, haue not onely attained the worthy fauour of their Soueraigne, but also haue beene enritched with the continuall looue and amitie of the Subiectes.</p>
            <p>These things (right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable) ioyntlye considered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with the late occasions so happily preuented, to see time growne to such an iron and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate nature, contrarie to that it hath beene in the aforenamed dayes; I am not onely confounded in a number of dismaying thoughts, but also ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb facs="tcp:13319:4"/>
my selfe as altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy.</p>
            <p>It is not vnkowen to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, in what occasions passed, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling an vnlooked for cause of daunger, to my gracious Soueraigne and her Realme: how not I alone, but I cheefely as one, gaue foorth such vnreprooueable notice of ensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing harmes, as bewrayed their secret trayterous intent, and also notably conuicted the aduersary. For which seruice, beyond my desert, I haue found the plentifull measure, of my Princesse fauoure and goodnes, as also the noble goodwill of her Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Counsell, of which high calling, as God and her Maiesty hath created you one: so am I in dutie to pray for your continuall welfare, whose Honourable freendship hath exceeded my poore demerit. But when I thinke on the vndeserued
<pb facs="tcp:13319:4"/>
ingratitude, wherewith mine owne Countreymen vnkindely rewarde me; I am forced to say, as one some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time sayd, <hi>A man is no where wurse e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed, then in his owne Countrey.</hi> If I had come as their aduersaryes did, for the subuersion of their peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able estate, and bloody ouerthrowe: then might I well haue contented my selfe, to be condemned with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche, and thrust foorth into infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. But comming as I did, to open the gap of trouble secretly ment vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; I finde not so much as I haue deserued, but yet a great deale more then I am able to suffer. Euery man will deskant on matters after his owne imagination, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn as pleaseth his humor, but that which is more, diuers prating Boyes (wherof I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> name some) wil take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d their cause, who haue beene found such hainous offenders;
<pb facs="tcp:13319:5"/>
if some of them were publiquely chastened, it would charme the tongues of a number more, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they perceiue them to be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered; ioyne with them in euill spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches together for company.</p>
            <p>My desire is therefore to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, that some good order may be appointed for such lewde and talka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue companions, and that they who are innocent of such wicked crimes, whereby (by them) they are malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously slaundered, may not be dealt withall after this manner; for the enemy dooth very well perceiue it, and smileth to see vs so shamefullie handled, besyde, the lyes and fables by such idle fellowes imagined, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them more bolde in theyr Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belles, to exclaime and defame euen as pleaseth them.</p>
            <p>To approoue my woordes true, two seditious and Traiterous Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets
<pb facs="tcp:13319:5"/>
haue lately beene printed and dispersed abroad, the one in French, the other in English; contayning such horrible and detestable slaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, bothe against Honorable, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipfull, learned and godly persons, as themselues, who are the Authors thereof, if they were not altogether giuen ouer as reprobate, might be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed to publish abroade. And yet will they say, they vse such mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, pietie and grauitie in all their actions, as no men are able to doo the like; how voyde they are of such vertuous gifts, I will not reason my selfe, but appeale to your Honor, and a number godlie and learned men, who I knowe haue seene their vnchristian like behauiour, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their dayly deedes and gesture, but also in their mallicious and slaunderous Libelles. These two a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forenamed Bookes (right Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble)

comming to my handes, and the famous vntruethes therein with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise considered; I prepared my selfe to write this breefe Aunswer, which, in dutie and humilitie, I commend to your Honourable view. How it shall please you to like thereof, I am not to enter into oppinion: neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, I haue good hope, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as I meant it, your Honour will accept it, which was and is, to displease none, but to pleasure and profit all men if I might, especially your Honor, to whom I wish more then heere I can vnfold, bothe of earthly honor, and heauenly happines.</p>

according to the credit of his woorke.</p>
                  <p>When I had reuealed the traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous spéeches of <hi>Payne</hi> the Préeste, how and after what ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ner, you may reade in the Booke before expressed: I was demaunded if I knew where hee was at that time.

Wherefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring when I serued Maister <hi>Roper,</hi> that there was one <hi>Thomas

Cooper</hi> a Cooke, who serued him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and also knew the aforesayde <hi>Paine</hi>: to him I thought good to go, because I had vnderstanding that he dwelt at <hi>Liuarde</hi> in <hi>Barkeshire</hi> with one Maister <hi>Yates,</hi> who was a very earnest Papist, and gaue great enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainement to all of that sect: thinking as it might so fall out, that we eyther might finde the sayd <hi>Paine</hi> there, or els vnderstand where he was.

When we were within the house, this <hi>Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:13319:13"/>
brought vs into the Buttery, where he whispering me in the eare, demaunded if my fellow were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church or no,<note place="margin">A holy kinde of Church, whereof the Deuill is Uicar.</note> as much to say, as whether he was a Papist or no?

And I am perswaded, that the people there present were astonied, to heare and perceyue that so modest a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, coulde harbour such a false and trayterous heart, to God, his Princesse and Countrey: yea, the Iudges dyd admire, that a man as he was, professing learning and looue in outwarde appearaunce, shoulde be so ouercome by the Deuil, as to séeke the spoyle and ruine of his Princesse and Countrey. Good cause had the people to be astonied, that so wicked members as they, should be found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, who were true and faith full Subiectes, and more cause had the Iudges of admiration, to sée their owne Countreymen, in a matter so horrible to appeare before them: little dyd any there thinke to heare them declared guiltlesse, their treasons so apparant, and the proofe so euident, but rather thought no torment suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, to reward them who were so haynous offendours, and therefore woorthilie, and according to desart, they were giuen vp guiltie.</p>

               <hi>Euerard Haunce, beeing a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Heretiques, and a bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour in England, beeing in a verie greenous agony of sicknesse, as it were, neere to the death: fell in a sound, wherein he remained so long, that his freendes altogeather reputed him for dead.</hi>

intollerable and greeuous paines, yea, the Soules of his freendes and most fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milliars, which he verie well knewe in their lyfe time. But that which is most straunge,</hi>

After this vision, beeing come againe to him selfe, he called for a Catholique Preest, who beeing come vnto him, how be it, his Kinsfolkes were against it greatly, as well for his Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as for loosing his benefice, which was woorth much: with great sorrowe &amp; repentaunce of his former lyfe, he made his confessio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the Preest, &amp; wholy renounced his benefice, embracing the Catholique faith. It so chaunced that he forsooke his Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey, admonishing those verie earnestly, whose places he had seene prepared for them in hell, to amende their liues: which they refusing to do, dyed within short space after,</hi>
