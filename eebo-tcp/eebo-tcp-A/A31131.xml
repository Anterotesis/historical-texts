            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Caſe of the City of EXON.</head>
            <p>FOR Prevention of <hi>Wools</hi> going to <hi>France</hi> from <hi>Ireland;</hi> The Port of <hi>Exon</hi> was ſhut up, leſt Veſſels coming about Lands End with Wool for <hi>Exon,</hi> might thereby have an opportunity to go for <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since which time, <hi>viz,</hi> in the 10 and 11th of King <hi>Willam,</hi> by an Act, Intituled, <hi>An Act, To prevent the Exportation of</hi> Wooll, <hi>out of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> into Foreign Parts, and for the Incouraging the Wollen Manufacture in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  </hi> amongſt other things it is Enacted,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Merchant who intends to Import any Wooll from <hi>Ireland,</hi> muſt give in the Quantity, Marks, Numbers, Package, with the Name of the Veſſel, and Maſtre, and muſt take a Licence, and enter into Bond with ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Sureties in treble the Value, to bring it to ſuch a particular Port in <hi>England.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That no Veſſel ſhall take any Wooll on Board in <hi>Ireland,</hi> until Bond be given by two Inhabitants of the place, Who are known to the Officer to be Sufficient Reſponſible Men, in double the value of the Wooll, to Land it in <hi>England.</hi>
               </hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That a Regiſter be kept in the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> to whom Certificates are to be returned of all Wool Exported, from <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Imported in <hi>England,</hi> with the Marks, Numbers, Quantities, Qualities, Duplicates of the Bonds, Certificates, Names of the Perſons, Signing all Cockets, and Returns, which ſhall be Writ on Paper, and not on Parchment, with the Names of the Veſſels, Perſons Exporting and Importing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vnder Divers other Limitations, and Reſtrictions required in the ſaid Act, beſides the Officers Forfeiting their places, and <hi>500 l.</hi> for Omitting their Duty or for neglecting, or Coniving at any thing contrary to this Act.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which, with other things which the ſaid Act requires, being conſider'd it is very unlikely that a Man in his Wits, who hath entred in the <hi>Cuſtom-Houſe,</hi> ſhould attempt to go for <hi>France,</hi> by coming about Lands End.</p>
            <list>
               <item>2. By means of ſhutting up the Port of <hi>Exon,</hi> there is ſeldom a Veſſel coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Lands End, ſo that the way is clear to all Owlers, and if they get off Shore, there is none to diſcover them. A Thief would think he had a great Priviledge, if the Watch were removed, and none to go in the Streets.</item>
               <item>3. Veſſels may come from <hi>Cheſter, Wales,</hi> or any Port of <hi>Scotland,</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> about the Lands End, for <hi>Exon,</hi> on a ſingle Bond, and why not from <hi>Ireland,</hi> under all the aforeſaid Reſtrictions.</item>
               <item>4. Veſſels may come from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Exon,</hi> where they muſt Sail within 7 Leagues. of <hi>Callis,</hi> why may they not then come from <hi>Ireland,</hi> where they need not Sail within 40 Leagues of any Foreign Port.</item>
            </list>
            <p>The Dammage of the City of <hi>Exon,</hi> by means of ſhutting up their Port.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. by Computation of the Serge-makers, they Work up Two Hundred Bags of Wool in the City and Subburbs Weekly, and in <hi>Crediton, Aſhburton, Tottneſs, Newton</hi> and other Places Adjacent, they convert the Value of Two Hundred Packs more into Serges, which Four Hundred Packs Coſt the Carriage, being near Forty Miles, Five Shillings the Pack, which is One Hundred Pound <hi>per</hi> Week, and is <hi>Per annum</hi> Five Thouſand Pounds.</item>
               <item>2. Wool is a Commodity known to draw Water Inſenſibly, on Ship-Board, be the Veſſel never ſo tight, and therefore it is the cuſtom in <hi>Exon,</hi> to take the Packs at the weight they weigh'd at the Weigh-houſe in <hi>Ireland,</hi> without breaking the Packs, but now they muſt carry it Forty Miles, the Packs are broaken, and they cannot take them by Invoyces, and many hundred Makers, not being able to Buy a Months Wool and pay for it before hand, are neceſſitated to have it in <hi>Exon,</hi> and either to pay for all the Water it gained on Ship-board, and all the Dirt and Rain it gathered in Forty Miles Carraiage; or otherwiſe muſt run all hazards. For if the Carrier take a Stone out of a Pack, the Rain (if it be wet weather) or the daſhing of the Horſes, carrying all on Horſe-back, will makeup the weight ſo that no Man can poſſibly know how much Wool, and how much Water he hath for his Money; and not one Man living that drives ſuch a Trade, can tell what he doth; it cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted that they pay ſo little, as for 12 Pound of Water upon a Pack, which at 8 <hi>d.</hi> the Pound, is 8 <hi>s.</hi> a Pack, and on 400 Packs a Week, is 200 Pound, and is 10000 <hi>l. per annum.</hi> It is found by Experience, that Wool hath Increaſed a Tenth part, and not to be diſcerned by handling.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>All which Premiſes being Humbly Referred to the Wiſdom of this</hi> Honourable Houſe, <hi>it is Prayed and Hoped, that a Clauſe may be brought in for</hi> Wool <hi>to be Imported at the Key of</hi> EXON, <hi>under what ever Reſtrictions, and Limitations, ſhall be further Required.</hi>
