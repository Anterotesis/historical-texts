            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Receiv'd the honour of your Letter, with the
Book you was pleas'd to ſend me, containing an
Examination of <hi>The Theory of the Earth.</hi> And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as you deſire, I ſhall give you my thoughts
of it in as narrow a compaſs as I can. The Author of
the <hi>Theory,</hi> you know, hath ſet down in Three Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
the Foundation of the Whole Work, and
ſo long as thoſe Propoſitions ſtand firm, the ſubſtance
of the <hi>Theory</hi> is ſafe, whatſoever becomes of particular
modes of explication in ſome parts: which are as
Problems, and may be explained ſeveral ways without
prejudice to the Principles upon which the <hi>Theory</hi> ſtands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Theoriſt takes but one ſingle Poſtulatum,</hi> viz.
<hi>That the</hi> Earth riſe from a Chaos. <hi>This is not call'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
queſtion, and this being granted, He lays down
Three Propoſitions conſecutively. Firſt,</hi> That the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
or Ante-diluvian Earth was of a different form and
conſtruction from the preſent Earth. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the
face of that Earth as it riſe from a Chaos, was ſmooth,
regular and uniform: without Mountains or Rocks, and
without an open Sea. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the diſruption of the
Abyſs, or diſſolution of that Primeval Earth, and its fall
into the Abyſs, was the cauſe of the Univerſal Deluge, and
of the deſtruction of the Old World: <hi>As alſo of the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
form of the preſent Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the Three Fundamental Propoſitions laid
down in the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Chapters of the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:38607:3"/>
               <hi>Theory.</hi> And for a further proof and confirmation of
them, eſpecially of the laſt, another Propoſition is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>(chap.</hi> 7.) in theſe words, <hi>The preſent form and ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of the Earth, both as to the ſurface, and as to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriour
parts of it, ſo far as they are acceſſible and known
to us, do exactly anſwer to the foregoing Theory concerning
the form and diſſolution of the Firſt Earth, and is not ſo
juſtly explained by any other Hypotheſis yet known.</hi> This
is offer'd as a proof <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> as they call it, or
from the effects: to ſhow the conſent and agreeement
of the parts and conſtruction of the preſent Earth, to
that Suppoſition of its being a ſort of Ruine, or the
effect and remains of a diſruption or diſſolution. And
to make this good, The Theoriſt draws a ſhort Scheme
of the general Form of the preſent Earth, and its ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity:
Then ſhows more particularly the marks
or ſignatures of a ruine or diſruption in ſeveral parts
of it: as in Mountains and Rocks, in the great Chanel
of the Sea, and in Subterraneous Cavities, and other
broken and disfigur'd parts of the Earth.</p>
            <p>Theſe concluſions with their arguments are the Summ
and principal Contents of the Firſt Book; But I muſt
alſo mind you of a Corollary in the Second Book,
drawn from theſe primary Propoſitions, which concerns
the ſituation of the Primitive Earth. For the Theoriſt
ſuppoſes that the poſture of that Earth, or of its Axis
was not oblique to the Axis of the Sun or of the
Ecliptick, as it is now, but lay parallel with the Axis
of the Sun, and perpendicular to the Plane of the
Ecliptick. By reaſon of which Poſition there was a
perpetual Spring or perpetual Equinox in that Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Earth. This, though a conſequence only from the
firſt Propoſitions, I thought fit to mind you of, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one of the peculiar and diſtinguiſhing Characters of
this <hi>Theory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:38607:3"/>
This being the ſtate of the <hi>Theory,</hi> or of thoſe parts
of it that ſupport the reſt, and wherein its ſtrength
conſiſts, he that will attack it to purpoſe, muſt throw
down, in the firſt place, theſe leading Propoſitions.
If the Examiner had taken this method, and confuted
the proofs that are brought in confirmation of each of
them, he needed have done no more. For the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
being deſtroyed, the Superſtructure would fall
of its own accord. But, if inſtead of this, you only
pick out a looſe ſtone here or there; or ſtrike off a
Pinnacle, this will not weaken the Foundation, nor
have any conſiderable effect upon the whole Building.
Let us therefore conſider in the firſt place, what this
Examiner hath ſaid againſt theſe Fundamental Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitions,
and accordingly you will better judge of the
reſt of his Work.</p>
            <p>His firſt Chapter is to ſhow that the Deluge might
be made by a Miracle. But who ever deny'd that?
No doubt God by his Omnipotency may do whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he pleaſes to the utmoſt extent of poſſibilities. But
he does not tell us wherein this Miracle conſiſted. Doth
he ſuppoſe that the Deluge could be made without
any increaſe of Waters upon the Earth? If there was
an increaſe of Waters, either they were created a-new,
or brought thither from ſome other part of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe:
So far is plain. And if he ſuppoſes a New Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of Waters for this purpoſe, and an annihilation
of them again at the end of the Flood, it had been
fair to have anſwered the Arguments that are given
againſt that Hypotheſis in the <hi>3d</hi> Chapter of the <hi>Theory.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Engl.</note>
And ſeeing there is no mention made of any ſuch
thing in the Sacred Hiſtory, if he aſſert it, he muſt
bring ſome proof of his aſſertion; for we are not
upon ſuch terms as to truſt upon bare word. On the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38607:4"/>
other hand, if he proceed upon ſuch Waters as were
already in being, and for his purpoſe either bring down
ſuperceleſtial Water, or bring up ſubterraneous, he
muſt tell us what thoſe Waters are, and muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
ſuch objections as are brought againſt either ſort
in the Second and Third Chapters of the <hi>Theory.</hi> We
muſt have ſome fixt point, ſome mark to aim at, if the
caſe be argued. Upon the whole, I think this his Firſt
Chapter might have been ſpar'd, as either affirming
nothing particularly, or giving no proof of what is
affirm'd.</p>
            <p>In his next Chapter about the <hi>Chaos,</hi> I was in hopes
to have found ſome thing more conſiderable, but (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
his long <hi>excerpta</hi> out of the <hi>Theory,</hi> both here
and elſewhere, which make a good part of his Book)
I find nothing but two ſmall Objections againſt the
formation of the Firſt Earth, as it is deſcrib'd by the
Theoriſt.<note place="margin">P. 37, 38.</note> This Examiner ſays, That the little earthy
particles of the Chaos would not ſwim upon the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of Oil, or any ſuch unctuous liquor: for how
little ſoever, yet being earthy, and Earth being heavier
than Oil, they muſt deſcend thorough it. But he
grants that duſt will ſwim upon Oil, and I willingly
allow, if theſe deſcending parts were <hi>huge lumps of ſolid
matter,</hi> ſuch as we ſhall meet with in his next Chapter,
they would eaſily break through both the Oil and the
Water under it: but that little tenuious particles or
ſmall duſt ſhould float upon Oil, I think is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
And he is ſo kind as to note an inſtance of this
himſelf,<note place="margin">P. 38, 39.</note> and to ſubjoin his reaſons for it. We ſee duſt,
ſaith he, though ſpecifically heavier than Oil, yet not
to ſink when caſt upon it. And the reaſon is, becauſe
all terreſtrial Bodies, tho fluid in their kind, yet in
ſome degree reſiſt ſeparation, and conſequently, I add,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:38607:4"/>
viſcous liquors which have ſome ſort of entanglement
amongſt themſelves, reſiſt ſeparation more than others.
Then he remarks further, that according as Bodies are
leſs, they have more ſurface in proportion to their
bulk, and conſequently, that <hi>ſmall Bodies, whoſe weight
or force to ſeparate the parts of the Fluid is but very little,
may have a ſurface ſo large, that they cannot overcome
the reſiſtance of the Fluid. That is, they cannot make way
for their deſcent through the Fluid, and therefore muſt
ſwim upon the ſurface of it.</hi> Be it ſo, then the particles
here mentioned by the Theoriſt, being little and of
large ſurfaces in proportion to their bulk, would ſwim
upon the ſurface of the Fluid, or mix with it, which
is all the Theoriſt affirms or ſuppoſes. And as this
tender film grew into a cruſt, and that into a ſolid
Arch, the parts of it would mutually ſupport one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other:
the concave ſuperficies of the Orb overſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and leaning upon the Waters. And this alſo
ſhews that his inſtance of a Solid Globe ſinking in a
Fluid, is little to the purpoſe in this caſe.</p>
            <p>But he hath a ſecond Objection behind,<note place="margin">P. 40.</note> or another
conſideration to prove that thoſe little particles would
pierce and paſs through this oily Liquid. This conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
is, the great height of the place from which
they deſcended: whereby, he thinks, they would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
ſuch a celerity and force in their deſcent, that
they muſt needs break through this orb of oily liquors
when they came at it. But this is to ſuppoſe that they
deſcended without interruption, or without having
their courſe ſtopt and their force broken in ſeveral
parts of their journey. This is an arbitrary and
groundleſs ſuppoſition. For theſe floating particles
did not fall like a ſtone, or a ponderous body, in
one continued line, but rather like fleaks of Snow,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:38607:5"/>
hovering and playing in the Air: their courſe being
often interrupted and diverted, and their force broken
again and again before they came to the end of their
journey; ſo that this ſuggeſtion can be of no force or
effect in the preſent caſe. However, if that will gratifie
him, we can allow that thouſands and millions of
theſe little particles might ſlip or creep thorough this
clammy liquor, yet there would enow of them be
entangled there to make it, firſt, a groſs liquid, then a
ſort of concretion, ſo as to ſtop the ſucceeding par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
from paſſing thorough it.</p>
            <p>I have done with all that is argumentative in this
Chapter. But this Writer is pleaſed to go ſometimes
out of his way of Philoſophizing, to make reflections
of another kind. Accordingly here and elſewhere he
makes inſinuations and ſuggeſtions as if the Theoriſt
did not own the hand of Providence, or of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
and extraordinary Providence in the formation
of the Earth. Or as if all things in the great revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions
of the Natural World were carryed on ſolely
by material and mechanical Cauſes. This ſuggeſtion
ought to be taken notice of, as being contrary to the
ſence of the Theoriſt as it is expreſt in ſeveral places.
In ſpeaking of the motions of the Chaos, the Theoriſt
makes <hi>the ſteddy hand of Providence which keeps all things
in weight and meaſure,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>P.</hi> 22. Note, the pages are cited according to the <hi>3d.</hi> Edit. of the <hi>Engl.</hi> and the <hi>2d.</hi> of the <hi>Lat. Theor.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>to be the inviſible guide of all its
motions.</hi> And in concluding his diſcourſe about the
formation of the Earth (<hi>chap. 5. p.</hi> 45.) The Theoriſt
ſays, <hi>This ſtructure is ſo marvellous, that it ought rather
to be conſider'd as a particular effect of the Divine Art,
than as the work of Nature:</hi> with many other remarks
there to the ſame purpoſe. Then as to the Diſſolution
of the Earth and the conduct of the Deluge,<note place="margin">Engl. Theor. ch. 8. p. 71, &amp;c.</note> 'tis made
miraculous alſo by the Theoriſt. And upon that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38607:5"/>
an account is given of Providence, both ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
and extraordinary, in reference to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Nature. And that not only as to the Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Diſſolution of the Earth, but alſo as to its
Conflagration and Renovation. For the Theoriſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
puts thoſe great revolutions under the particular
conduct and moderation of Providence. Laſtly, As to

what this Author hath ſaid (rudely enough, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his way) of Mr. <hi>Wotton,</hi> That <hi>he either under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands

               <hi>or elſe that he never read</hi> D. C. <hi>his
Principles,</hi> may with a little change be apply'd to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in this caſe, That either he never read over, or
does not remember, or, which is ſtill worſe, does
wilfully miſrepreſent what the Theoriſt hath writ up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this ſubject. The ſum of all is this, <hi>Deus non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficit
in neceſſariis, nec redundat in ſuperfluis.</hi> God is
the God of Nature, and the Laws of Nature are his
Laws: Theſe we are to follow ſo far as they will go,
and where they fall ſhort we muſt riſe to higher Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;
but we ought not to introduce a needleſs exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of the divine Power, for a cover to our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p>To conclude this Chapter, I will leave one Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement
with the Examiner concerning the Chaos.
When he ſpeaks of the World's riſing from the Moſaick
Chaos, if by <hi>World</hi> he underſtand the whole Univerſe,
as he ſeems to do: not this inferiour World only, but
the fixt Stars alſo, and all the Heavens: If that, I ſay,
be his meaning and opinion, he will meet with other
opponents beſides the Theoriſt, that will conteſt that
point with him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:38607:6"/>
We come now to the Third Chapter, concerning
the <hi>Mountains</hi> of the Earth, which is a ſubject indeed
that deſerves conſideration, ſeeing it reaches to the
three fundamental Propoſitions before mentioned, and
the Form of the Antediluvian Earth. Which Form
the Examiner would have to be the ſame with that of
the preſent Earth: To have had Mountains and Rocks,
an open chanel of the Sea, with all the cavities and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities
within or without the ſurface of it, as at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
If he can prove this, he needs go no farther, he
may ſpare his pains for the reſt. I'll undertake that the
Theoriſt ſhall make no farther defence of his Theory, if
the Examiner can make good proof of this one concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
But on the other hand, the Examiner ought to be ſo
ingenuous as to acknowledge that all that he hath ſaid
beſides, till this be prov'd, can be of little or no effect
as to the ſubſtance of the Theory. Let us then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
how he raiſes Mountains and Rocks, and gives
us an account of all the other inequalities that we find
in the preſent form of the Earth, by an immediate
formation or deduction from the Chaos.</p>
            <p>To ſhew this, he ſuppoſes that the Chaos had Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and Rocks ſwiming in it, or according to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
<hi>huge lumps of ſolid matter.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 49. 51.</note> Theſe are things,
I confeſs, which I never heard of before in a Chaos:
which hath been always deſcrib'd and ſuppos'd a maſs
of fluid matter all over: But this Author confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſays,<note place="margin">P. 48.</note> 
               <hi>We muſt conclude THEREFORE that the
Chaos was not ſo fluid a maſs, &amp;c.</hi> This <hi>therefore</hi> refers
us to an antecedent reaſon, which is this, He ſays, to
make the Chaos an entirely fluid maſs is hard to be
granted, <hi>ſince the greateſt parts of Bodies we have in the
Earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
               <hi>at leaſt ſo far as we can diſcern, are hard and ſolid,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38607:6"/>
and there is not ſuch a quantity of water in the Earth, as
would be requiſite to ſoften and liquifie them all. Beſides
a great part of them, as Stones and Metals, are unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of being liquified by water.</hi> Very good, What is
this to the <hi>Theory?</hi> Does the Theoriſt any where affirm
or ſuppoſe that there were Stones or Metals in the
Chaos? or that they were liquified by water? This
muſt refer to ſome Hypotheſis of his own, or to ſome
other Author's Hypotheſis that run in his mind. The
Theoriſt owns no ſuch doctrine or ſuppoſition.</p>
            <p>However let's conſider how this new Idea of a Chaos
is conſiſtent with the Laws of Nature. What made
theſe <hi>huge lumps of ſolid matter,</hi> whether Stone or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
to ſwim in the fluid maſs? This is againſt all rules
of Gravity and of Staticks: as he ſeems to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and urge it when he thought it to his purpoſe.
In the precedent Chapter <hi>(p.</hi> 42.) when he ſpeaks of
Stones and Minerals, he ſays, <hi>'Tis certain that theſe great
heavy Bodies muſt have ſunk to the bottom if they were
left to themſelves.</hi> And he that will not allow duſt or
little earthy particles to float upon an Oily Liquor, I
wonder how he will make, not little particles, but
theſe huge ſolid lumps, of Stone, Metals or Minerals,
to float in the Chaos.</p>
            <p>He ſeems to own and be ſenſible of this inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<hi>(p.</hi> 50.) and thereupon finds an expedient or eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
which a leſſer Wit would not have thought on.
He ſuppoſes that theſe <hi>huge</hi> firm ſolid Lumps were
hollow,<note place="margin">P. 51.</note> like empty bottles, and that would keep them
from ſinking. But who told him they were hollow?
Is not this precarious? or if one would uſe ſuch terms
as he does, is not this <hi>Chimerical and ridiculous?</hi> What
made thoſe ſolid firm Lumps hollow? When, or
where, or how were their inward parts ſcrap'd out of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38607:7"/>
them? Nor would this hollowneſs, however they came
by it, make them ſwim, unleſs there was a meer Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum
in each of them. If they were filled with the
liquid matter of the Chaos, they would indeed be
lighter than if wholly ſolid, but they would ſtill be
heavier than an equal bulk of the fluid Chaos, and
conſequently would ſink in it: the preponderancy that
would ariſe from the ſhell or ſolid part ſtill remaining.</p>
            <p>Now let's conſider how ſuch Mountains or long
ridges of Mountains as we have upon the Earth, were
formed and ſetled by theſe floating Lumps. He ſays,
<hi>part of theſe lumps or maſſes ſtanding out or being higher
than the Fluid,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 50, 51.</note> 
               <hi>would compoſe a Mountain:</hi> as there are
<hi>Mountains of Ice that float upon the Northern Seas.</hi> But
are not mountains of Rock and Stone, ſuch as ours
commonly are, heavier than mountains of Ice, that
is ſpecifically lighter than Water? This might have
been conſider'd by the Examiner in drawing the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel.
And ſtill I'm at a loſs, what <hi>Fluid</hi> it is he means,
when he ſays, Theſe Lumps or Maſſes <hi>ſtanding out, or
being higher than the Fluid:</hi> Does he mean by this Fluid
the whole Chaos? Did theſe Mountains ſtand at the
top of the Chaos, partly within and partly above it?
Then what drew them down below, if they ſtood
equally pois'd there in their Fluid, and as high as the
Moon, if the Chaos reacht ſo high. This one would
think could not be his meaning 'tis ſo extravagant:
and yet there was no other Fluid than the general Chaos,
till that was divided and diſtinguiſht into ſeveral
Maſſes. Then indeed there was an Abyſs, or a region
of Waters that covered the interiour Earth, and was
ſeparate from the Air above. Let us then ſuppoſe this
Abyſs to be the waters or Fluid this Author means,
upon which his Mountains ſtood: then the reſt of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38607:7"/>
the Earth, as it came to be form'd, muſt be continu'd
and joyn'd with theſe Mountains, and in like manner
laid over the waters: ſo as in this method you ſee we
ſhould have an Orb of Earth built over the Abyſs.
This is a very favourable ſtroke for the Theoriſt, and
grants him in effect his principal concluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> That
the <hi>firſt anteluvian Earth was built over the Abyſs.</hi> This
being admitted, there could be no univerſal Deluge
without a diſruption of that Earth, and an eruption
of the Abyſs: which is a main point gain'd. And 'tis
plain we make no falſe Logick in collecting this from
his Principles and Conceſſions: For, as we ſaid before,
if theſe Mountains were founded upon the Abyſs,
they muſt have a continuity and conjunction with the
reſt of the ſurface of the Earth, if they were ſuch as
our Mountains are now, and ſo all the habitable
Earth muſt be ſpread upon the Abyſs.</p>
            <p>But ſtill he hath another difficulty to encounter,
How the great Chanel of the Sea was made upon this
ſuppoſition. Why was not that part of the Globe
fill'd up by the deſcent of the earthy particles of the
Chaos as well as the reſt? The Chanel of the Ocean
is commonly ſuppos'd to take up half of the Globe, how
came this gaping Gulph to remain unfill'd, ſeeing it
was encompaſt with the Chaos as well as any other
parts? Was the motion of the particles ſuſpended
from deſcending upon that part of the Globe: or
were they fill'd up at firſt, and afterwards thrown out
again to make room for the Sea? This may deſerve
his conſideration, as well as the Mountains. And how
dextrous ſoever this Author may be in other
things I know not, but, in my mind, he hath no
good hand in making Mountains: and I'm afraid he
would have no better ſucceſs in forming the Chanel
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38607:8"/>
of the Sea, which he is wiſely pleaſed to take no
notice of.</p>
            <p>And indeed the Examiner ſeems to be ſenſible him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
that he hath no good luck in aſſigning the <hi>Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Cauſes</hi> of Mountains from the Chaos, and therefore
he is willing to bear off from that point, and to lay
the whole ſtreſs upon their <hi>Final Cauſes:</hi> without any
regard to their origin or how they came firſt into be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
His words are theſe,<note place="margin">P. 52.</note> 
               <hi>But ſuppoſing the Efficient
Cauſes of Mountains unknown or impoſſible to be aſſign'd,
yet ſtill there remains the final cauſes to be enquir'd into,
which will do as well for our purpoſe,</hi> with what follows
there concerning thoſe Authors that exclude final cauſes.
If there be ſuch Authors, let them anſwer for themſelves,
the Theoriſt is not concern'd. Grant the firſt point, That
Mountains could not ariſe from any known Efficient
Cauſes in the firſt concretion of the Chaos, or in the
firſt habitable Earth that riſe from it, the Theoriſt
readily allows (as appears fully in the two laſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of the Second Book) the uſe of final cauſes in the
contemplation of Nature,<note place="margin">Eng. Theor.</note> as being great arguments
of the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God. But this ought
not to exclude the Efficient Cauſes in a <hi>Theory,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it would be no <hi>Theory,</hi> but a work of another
Nature. Though a man knew the Final Cauſe of a
Watch or Clock, namely, to tell him the Hour of
the Day, yet if he did not know the conſtruction of
its parts, what was the Spring of motion, what the order
of the Wheels, and how they mov'd the Hand of the
Dial, he could not be ſaid to underſtand that little
Machine; or at leaſt not to underſtand it ſo well as
he that knew the conſtruction and dependance of all
its parts, in vertue whereof that effect was brought
to paſs. In many caſes we do not underſtand the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38607:8"/>
Final Cauſes, and in many we do not underſtand the
Efficient, but notwithſtanding we muſt endeavour, ſo
far as we are able, to joyn and underſtand them both:
the end and the means to it. For by the one as well
as the other, the divine Power and Wiſdom are il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated.
And ſeeing every effect hath its Efficient
Cauſe, if we cannot reach it we muſt acknowledge
our Speculations to be ſo far imperfect.</p>
            <p>After this excurſion about Final Cauſes,<note place="margin">P. 54.</note> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
<hi>That it is impoſſible to ſubſiſt or live without Rocks
and Mountains.</hi> Conſequently, no Earth is habitable
without Rocks and Mountains. But how can he tell
this? Hath he been all over the Univerſe to make
his Obſervations? or hath he had a Revelation to tell
him that there is no one habitable Planet throughout
all the Works of God but what is of the ſame Form
with our Earth as to Rocks and Mountains. Who
hath ever obſerv'd Mountains and Rocks in <hi>Jupiter,</hi>
or in the remains of <hi>Saturn?</hi> I ſhould think ſuch a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
aſſertion as he makes, a bold and unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
limitation of the Divine Omniſcience and Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotency.
Who dares conclude that the infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Power of God is confin'd to one ſingle mode
or fabrick of an habitable World? We know there
are many Planets about our Sun beſides this Earth,
and of different poſitions and conſtructions: Neither
do we know but there be as many about other
Suns or fixt Stars: muſt we ſuppoſe that they are all
caſt in the ſame mould? That they are all formed
after the Model of our Earth, with Mountains and
Rocks, and Gulphs and Caverns?</p>

This was the judgment of the Shepherd: who
could imagine nothing different or nothing better
than his own Town or Village: thoſe may imitate
him that pleaſe. 'Tis true, <hi>Suum cuique pulchrum,</hi> is
an uſual ſaying, but we think that to proceed from
fondneſs rather and ſelf-conceit, than from a true and
impartial judgment of things. In contemplating the
Works of God we ought to have reſpect to his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
and infinite Wiſdom, <gap reason="foreign">

may remember how an Heathen hath upbraided and
derided that narrowneſs of Spirit,<note place="margin">Cicer. de Nat. Deor. l. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Quae tantae ſunt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi

be no Animals of another form from thoſe we have
upon this Earth, as that there can be no Worlds, or
habitable Earths of another form and ſtructure from
the preſent Earth. <hi>An quicquam tam puerile dici poteſt,</hi>
ſays the ſame Author, <hi>quàm ſi ea genera belluarum quae
in Rubro mari, Indiâve gignantur, nulla eſſe dicamus?
Atqui ne curioſiſſimi quidem homines exquirendo audire
tam multa poſſunt, quàm ſunt multa quae Terrâ, Mari,
paludibus, fluminibus exiſtunt, quae negemus eſſe quia nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam

'tis raſhneſs or folly to confine the varieties of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
and Nature to the narrow compaſs of what
we have ſeen, or of what falls under our imagination.
This is a more <hi>ſtrange and aſſuming boldneſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 54.</note> as he terms
it, than what he aſcribes to the Theoriſt for ſaying,
We can obſerve no order in the ſituation of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:38607:9"/>
nor regularity in their form and ſhape. If the
Examiner knows any, why does he not tell us what
it is, and wherein it conſiſts. Is it neceſſary that
Mountains ſhould be exact Pyramids or Cones, or any
of the Regular Bodies? Or rang'd upon the Earth in
rank and file, or in a quincuncial order, or like pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
garden-knots? If they had been deſign'd for beauty
this might have done well: But providence ſeems on
purpoſe to have left theſe irregularities in their Figure
and Site, as marks and ſignatures to us that they are
the effects of a ruine.</p>
            <p>But to ſhew further and more particularly the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of Mountains,<note place="margin">P. 55. and 61.</note> the Examiner ſays without them
'tis impoſſible there ſhould be Rivers, or without Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
an habitable world. Neither of theſe propoſitions
ſeem to me to be ſure: They run ſtill upon impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities,
which is a nice Topick and lies much out of
our reach. I think Vapors may be condens'd other ways
than by Mountains, and an Earth might be ſo fram'd as
to give a courſe to Rivers tho there were no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Mountains, if the general figure of it was higher
in one part than another. Then as to the abſolute
neceſſity of Rivers to make an Earth habitable that
is queſtionable too. We are told by good Authors
of ſome Countries or Iſlands that have no rivers or
ſprings, and yet are habitable and fruitful, being wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
by Dews. This may give us an advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
from a part to the whole, that an Earth may
be made habitable without rivers. If at Firſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours
aſcended and fell down in dews ſo as to <hi>water
the whole face of the Earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 2. 6.</note> God might if he had pleas'd
have continued the ſame courfe of Nature. And it
is the opinion of many Interpreters, and ſeems to have
been an ancient tradition, that there was no rain till
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38607:10"/>
the Deluge. If there was no Rain-bow in the
firſt Earth (which I think the Theoriſt hath undeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
prov'd, Theor. Book II. c. 5.) it will be hard to
prove that there were then any watery clouds in the
habitable parts of the Earth.<note place="margin">Galil. Syſt. Coſ. p. 133.</note> And our beſt Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
will allow no clouds or rains in the Moon (and
ſome of them no Rivers) yet will not ſuppoſe the
Moon unhabitable.<note place="margin">Hugen. Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moth. l. 2. p. 115.</note> To conclude, 'tis a great vanity,
to ſay no worſe, for ſhort-ſighted Creatures and of
narrow underſtandings to preſcribe to Providence
what is neceſſary and indiſpenſable to the frame
and order of an habitable World.</p>
            <p>We proceed to his fourth Chapter: which is to
ſhew the inconveniences that would fall upon the
inhabitants of the Earth, in caſe it had ſuch a poſture
as the Theoriſt hath aſſign'd to the Antediluvian
Earth: namely, that its Axis was parallel to the Axis
of the Ecliptick, or Perpendicular to its Plane, and
not oblique as it ſtands now. But will this Author
vouch that there are no habitable Planets in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
or even about our Sun, that have this poſture
which he blames ſo much? <hi>Jupiter</hi> is known to have
a perpetual Equinox, and his Axis parallel to the
Axis of the Ecliptick: And <hi>Mars</hi> hath little or no obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
that is obſervable. And muſt this be a reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon Providence? Or muſt we ſuppoſe that theſe
Planets have no inhabitants, or that their habitations
are very bad and incommodious? <hi>Jupiter</hi> is the
nobleſt Planet we have in our Heaven, whether you
conſider its magnitude or the number of its Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants.
If then a Planet of that order and dignity have
ſuch a poſition and aſpect to the Sun, why might not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38607:10"/>
our Earth have had the ſame, proper to that ſtate
and agreeable to the Divine wiſdom? Yet he is ſo

            <p>This Examiner cenſures the Theoriſt very rudely
for making uſe of <hi>Phyfical Cauſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 76.</note> and not arguing
from <hi>Final Cauſes,</hi> which he ſays, <hi>are the true Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Natural Philoſophy.</hi> But if this be the uſe he
makes of Final Cauſes, To tell God Almighty what is
beſt to be done, in this or that World: I had rather
content my ſelf with <hi>Phyſical Cauſes</hi> to know what
God hath done, and conclude it to be the beſt, and
that we ſhould judge it ſo, if we had the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of thought and proſpect its Maker had. There
are indeed ſome <hi>Final Cauſes</hi> that are ſo manifeſt, that
I ſhould think it ſottiſhneſs or obſtinacy for a Man
to deny them: but I ſhould alſo think that Man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
that ſhould pretend to draw the Scheme
and Plan of every World from his Idea of <hi>Final Cauſes.</hi>
There are ſome men that mightily cry out againſt
<hi>Reaſon,</hi> yet none more fond of it than they are when
they can get it on their ſide. So ſome men inveigh
againſt <hi>Phyſical Cauſes</hi> when others make uſe of them,
and yet as gladly as any make uſe of them themſelves
when they can make them ſerve their purpoſe. And
when they cannot reach them, then they deſpiſe them,
and are all for <hi>Final Cauſes.</hi> This Author ſays, God
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38607:11"/>
always <hi>chuſes ſuch conſtitutions and poſitions of things,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 63.</note>
               <hi>as bring with them the greateſt good and utility to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.</hi>
Very true, to the <hi>Univerſe:</hi> But who made
him judge what is beſt to the Univerſe? Does he look
upon this Earth as the Univerſe? whereof it is but
a ſmall particle, or an atome in compariſon. Muſt
there be no variety in the numberleſs worlds which
God hath made? Muſt they all be one and the ſame
thing repeated again and again? That I'm ſure does
not <hi>well agree with the infinite Wiſdom and Power of
God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe we did confine our Thoughts to this
Earth. We may be aſſur'd that it hath undergone
and will undergo, within the compaſs of its durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
very different ſtates, and yet all accommodate to
Providence. Thoſe that ſuppoſe the Heavens and the
Earth never to have had any other conſtitution and
conſtruction than what they have now: or that there
hath never been any great change and revolution in
our Natural World, follow the very doctrine which
S. <hi>Peter</hi> oppoſes and confutes in his <hi>2d.</hi>

               <hi>Epiſtle:</hi> I mean

in the ſame ſtate they are in now, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
or from the Creation, and are to continue ſo.
In confutation of this opinion S. <hi>Peter</hi> there minds
them of the Change made at the Deluge, and of the
different conſtitution and conſtruction of the Heavens
and the Earth before and after the Deluge: whereby
they were diſpos'd to undergo a different fate, one by
Water, and the other by Fire. And he tells us in the
ſame place, that after the Conflagration there will be
<hi>New Heavens</hi> and a <hi>New Earth.</hi> So that there is no
one fixt and permanent ſtate even of this Earth, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:38607:11"/>
to the Will and Wiſdom of Providence. But
enough hath been ſaid by the Theoriſt upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
(<hi>Theor. Lat. l. 1. c. 1. &amp; 2. Review p. 160, &amp;c. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeol.
l. 2. c.</hi> 3, 5, 6.) and if they will not conſider the
arguments propos'd there, 'twould be in vain to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
them here.</p>
            <p>Theſe things premis'd, Let's conſider what incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
are alledged, or what Arguments againſt
that equality of Seaſons, or the grand cauſe of them,
the Paralleliſm of the Axis of the Earth with the Axis
of the Sun. He ſays upon this ſuppoſition there is
more heat now in the Climates of the Earth than
could have been then. And what if there be? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his computation (which is aim'd againſt another
Author) be true or falſe, 'tis little to the <hi>Theory.</hi> If
the heat was equal and moderate in the temperate
and habitable Climates who would deſire the extream
heats of Summer?<note place="margin">P. 66.</note> But he ſays, That heat would
not be ſufficient for the generation of Vegetables. How
does that appear? ſuppoſing that heat conſtant
throughout the whole Year. Does he think there
are no Vegetables in <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which hath ſtill the ſame
poſition the Theoriſt gave to the Antediluvian Earth.
And as to heat, that Planet is at vaſtly a greater di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
from the Sun than our Earth, and conſequently
hath ſo much leſs heat: yet I cannot believe that
great Planet to be only a huge lump of bald and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
Earth. As to our Antediluvian Earth, 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
that the conſtitution of Plants and Animals was
different then from what it is now, as their longaevity
was different, to which any exceſſes of heat or cold are
noxious; and the frequency and multiplicity of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
and corruptions in the preſent Earth, is part
of that vanity to which it was ſubjected. But this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminer
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:38607:12"/>
ſays moreover, If the firſt Earth had that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
the greateſt part of it would not be habitable.
But how much leſs habitable would it be than the
preſent Earth? where the open Sea, which was not
then, takes up half of its ſurface and makes it unha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable.
'Tis likely the Torrid Zone was unhabitable
in that Earth: but 'tis probable the Poles or Polar
parts were more habitable than they are now, ſeeing
they would have the Sun, or rather Half-Sun perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
in their Horizon. And as to the temperate
Climates, as we call them, they would be under ſuch
a gentle and conſtant warmth, as would be more
grateful to the Inhabitants, and more proper and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
for a continual Verdure and Vegetation, than
any region of the preſent Earth is now.</p>
            <p>But this Objector does not conſider on the other
hand, what an hard life they would lead in thoſe days,
at leaſt in many parts of the Earth, if the ſeaſons of
the year were the ſame they are now, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
to Herbs, Fruits and Water: for that was the
Diet of Mankind till the Deluge. Should we not
think it an unmerciful impoſition now, to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
the uſe of Fleſh-meat all the year long? Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it poſſible that the life of Man could be ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Herbs and Fruits and Water in the colder Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates,
where the Winters are ſo long and barren,
and the cold ſo vehement? But if you ſuppoſe a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
Spring throughout the Earth, the Heavens mild,
and the juices of Fruits and Plants more nutritive,
that Objection would ceaſe, and their longaevity be
more intelligible.</p>
            <p>We come now to the Cauſes of the change in the
poſture of the Earth, where the Theoriſt hath ſet down
his conjectures what he thought the moſt probable to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:38607:12"/>
be the occaſion of it: namely, either ſome inequality
in the libration of the Earth, after it was diſſolved
and broken: or a change in the Magnetiſm of its Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
conſequent upon its diſſolution and the different
ſituation of its parts. But this Examiner will neither
allow any change to have been made in the poſition
of the Earth ſince the beginning of the World: nor
if there was a change, that it could be made from ſuch
Cauſes. The firſt of theſe points you ſee is matter
of fact: and ſo it muſt be prov'd partly by Hiſtory
and partly by Reaſon. Some things are noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
which argue that the Antediluvian Earth was
different from the preſent in its frame and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as alſo in reference to the Heavens: and the
places are referred to where that matter is treated
more largely by the Theoriſt. If it be granted that
there was a permanent change made in the ſtate of
Nature at the Deluge, or any other time, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
that it was made by a change of the ſituation
of the Earth and the conſequences of it, then this Writer
muſt aſſign ſome other change made which would
have the ſame effects: that is, which will anſwer and
agree with the Phenomena of the Firſt Earth, and alſo
of the preſent. When this is done, if it be clear and
convictive, we muſt acquieſce in it. But I do not ſee
that it is ſo much as attempted by this Author.</p>
            <p>This ſuppos'd change, I ſay, is matter of Fact, and
therefore we muſt conſult Hiſtory and Reaſon for the
proof or diſproof of it. As to Hiſtory, the Theoriſt
hath cited to this purpoſe <hi>Leucippus, Anaxagoras, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocritus,
Empedocles, Plato</hi> and <hi>Diogenes.</hi> Theſe were
the moſt renowned Philoſophers amongſt the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents:
and all theſe ſpeak of an inclination of the Earth
or the Poles, which hath been made in former ages.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:38607:13"/>
Theſe, one would think, might be allow'd as good
witneſſes of a former Tradition concerning a change in
the ſituation of the Earth, when nothing is brought
againſt them. And this change is particularly call'd
by <hi>Plato</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a diſharmony or
diſconcerting of the motions of the Heavens, which
he makes the ſource and origin of the preſent Evils
and inconveniences of Nature. Beſides, he dates this
change from the expiration of the reign of <hi>Saturn,</hi> or
when <hi>Jupiter</hi> came to take the government upon him.
And this, you know, in the ſtyle of thoſe times, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
the end of the Golden Age. Thus far <hi>Plato</hi> carries
the Tradition. Now the Poets tell us expreſly that
there was a <hi>perpetual Spring,</hi> or a perpetual Equinox
in the time of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and that the inequality of the
Year, or the diverſity of Seaſons was firſt introduc'd
by <hi>Jupiter.</hi> The Authors and places are well known
and noted by the Theoriſt, I need not repeat them
here. You ſee what this evidence amounts to, both
that there hath been a change, and ſuch a change, as
alter'd the courſe of the Year and brought in a viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Seaſons. And this according to the Doctrines
or Traditions remaining amongſt the Heathens. The
<hi>Jews</hi> and Chriſtians ſay the ſame thing but in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manner: They do not ſpeak of the Golden
Age, or of the reign of <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Jupiter,</hi> but of the
ſtate of, Paradiſe, or <hi>Gan-Eden;</hi> and concerning that
they ſay the ſame things which the Heathen Authors
ſay in different words. The <hi>Jews</hi> make a perpetual
Equinox in Paradiſe, the Chriſtians a perpetual ſere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
a perpetual Spring; And this cannot be without
a different ſituation of the Earth from what it hath
now. He may ſee the citations, if he pleaſe, in the
<hi>Theory</hi> or <hi>Archaeologiae.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:38607:13"/>
It were to be wiſht that this Examiner would look
a little into Antiquity, when he hath time. It may
be that would awaken him into new thoughts, and a
more favourable opinion of the Theory as to this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
Give me leave to mind him in his own way,
what ſome ancient Aſtronomers have ſaid relating to
this ſubject. <hi>Baptiſta Mantuanus</hi> ſpeaking of the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaevity
of the Antediluvians,<note place="margin">De Patien. l. 2. c. 27.</note> ſays, <hi>Erant illis, ut Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomiâ

and concentrical motion of the heavens and the
Earth, at that time: To which he imputes the great
vertue of their herbs and fruit, and the long lives of
their Animals. <hi>Petrus Aponenſis,</hi> who liv'd above an

<hi>This you ſee is Aſtronomy in an old faſhion'd dreſs,
but you can eaſily take off the diſguiſe, and apply it
to the true Syſteme of the Heavens. The ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
refers you for a more full explication of that
matter to his</hi> Lectiones ſucciſivae Dial prim. <hi>which
Book I have not yet had an opportunity to ſee. I
believe it is in his</hi> Opera Philologica, <hi>printed in</hi>
Octavo <hi>at</hi> Baſil.</p>
            <p>But ſince the firſt writing of the Theory, there
have been Aethiopick Antiquities produc'd from an
Abyſſine Philoſopher, and tranſmitted to us by <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſco
Patricio</hi> in his Dialogues. If that account he
gives of the Aethiopian <hi>Archaeologiae</hi> be true and genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine,
they exceed all other upon this ſubject. For they
do not only mention this particular of the unity of
ſeaſons in the Primitive Earth, but the other principal
parts of the Theory: As the Concuſſion and Fraction
of the Earth, that the face of it before was ſmooth
and uniform, and upon that diſruption it came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
another form, with Mountains, Rocks, Sea and
Iſlands. Theſe and other ſuch characters are mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
there, whereof the Examiner may ſee an account,
if he pleaſe,<note place="margin">P. 189.</note> in the laſt edition of the <hi>Engliſh Theory.</hi>
The ſtory indeed is ſurpriſing which way ſoever you
take it, whether it was the invention of that Abyſſine
Philoſopher, or a real Tradition deriv'd from the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:38607:14"/>
Aethiopian Gymnoſophiſts. However that be, there
are otherwiſe ſuch conſpicuous footſteps in Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick
hiſtory, and in what may be call'd Eccleſiaſtick
amongſt the Jews and Chriſtians, of ſome Revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the ſyſtem of the world, as muſt give occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to any thinking man to ſuppoſe that there hath
been a change made in the ſituation of the Earth.
This by ſome of the forementioned Authors is aſcrib'd
expreſly to the Earth, and what by others (according to
their hypotheſis) is aſcrib'd to the higher heavens, we
know upon a juſt interpretation belongs to the Earth.
Thoſe alſo that aſcribe ſuch Phaenomena to Paradiſe or
the Golden Age, as are not intelligible upon any other
ſuppoſition, muſt alſo be referr'd to this change of the
ſite or poſture of the Earth. So that upon all accounts
(mediately or immediately) the matter of fact, That
the Earth hath undergone ſuch a change, is teſtified
by Hiſtory, Antiquity and Tradition. It deſerves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
to be obſerv'd that there was a general Tradition
amongſt the Ancients concerning the Inhabitability
of the Torrid zone; which may be an argument or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,
that there was a ſtate of Nature at one time
or other, when this was true, and that ſuch a general
opinion could not ariſe and be continued ſo long
without ſome foundation.</p>
            <p>So much for Hiſtory to determine matter of fact.
Now as to Reaſon (which we mentioned as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
head to prove or diſprove this concluſion) That
form of the Primitive Earth which is aſſigned by the
Theoriſt, being ſuppos'd, namely that it was regular,
uniform, and had an equal libration, it would natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
take an even and parallel poſition with the Axis
of its Orbit, or of the Ecliptick; as is ſet down more
at large in the Theory. Nor can any reaſon be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
to the contrary.<note place="margin">P. 83.</note> Tis true, this Examiner not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:38607:15"/>
any Uniformity and Equilibration of
that Earth, pretends it would be indifferent to any Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or <hi>retain any Poſition given, as a Sphere will do put
in a Fluid.</hi> This might be, if that Sphere or Globe
was reſting: but if it was turn'd about its Axis,
and the Axis of the Fluid (which is the preſent
caſe) it would certainly take a Poſition parallel to
the Axis of its Fluid, if there was no other impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment.</p>
            <p>The matter of fact being ſettled with the Cauſe
of it, what the Cauſes of the change were is
more Problematical. The Philoſophers forecited
gave their reaſon, <hi>Ariſtarchus Samius</hi> gives another,
and a <hi>Comet</hi> by ſome is made the occaſion of it. The
Theoriſt thinks that the Diſſolution of the Earth
was the fundamental cauſe, and that the change
came to paſs at that time, as many indications
and arguments ſhew. And as to the immediate
cauſe or cauſes of it, I know none more probable
than what the Theoriſt hath propoſed: Either the
change of its Center of Gravity,<note place="margin">Eng. Theor. p. 134.</note> or of its Magnetiſm:
The line of direction to thoſe Magnetick particles
and their paſſing through the Earth being ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
as to turn the Earth into another poſture and
hold it there. As to thoſe expreſſions that he ſeems
to quarrel with, of the Inclination of the Earth or
the Pole towards the Sun, 'tis the expreſſion of the
Ancient Philoſophers, though I think it might more
properly be called an Obliquation. Then that the
former ſtate is called <hi>ſitus rectus,</hi> is another expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
which he finds fault with: 'tho every one ſees
that a <hi>right ſituation</hi> in ſuch places is oppoſed to
an <hi>oblique</hi> or inclined poſition to the Axis of the
Sun or Ecliptick, and had been called <hi>parallel</hi> in
ſeveral other places:<note place="margin">P. 71.</note> and which he himſelf ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:38607:15"/>
as well as other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors<note n="*" place="margin">Perpetuò enim illic fruuntur Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctio, quoniam axem motûs diurni Jupiter rectum fermè habet ad planum itineris ſui circa Solem, nec ut Tellus obliquum. <hi>Hugen. Coſmoth.</hi> p. 105.</note>,
calls a right Poſition.
This is but trifling about
words. If he grant that the
Primitive Earth being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form,
and conſequently equally pois'd, its Axis would
be parallel (which for ſhortneſs, is ſometimes call'd
<hi>right)</hi> to the Axis of its Orbit, and is now in a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
and oblique poſture: This is all the Theoriſt deſires
as to matter of fact. I conceive the whole matter
thus: When the Earth was in that even and parallel
poſture with the Axis of the Sun, it had a perpetual
Equinox and unity of Seaſons, the Equator and Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
being coincident. And as to the Heavens, they
with the fixt Stars mov'd or ſeem'd to move uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and concentrically with the Earth. But when the
Earth chang'd its poſture to that which it hath now,
the Year became unequal, and the Equator and Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
became diſtinct circles, or, if you will, a new
circle ariſe from that diſtinction. The Earth in the
mean time continuing its annual courſe in the Ecliptick,
had the poſition of its Axis chang'd to a paralleliſm
with the Axis of the Equator, which it holds through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the whole Year. As to the Heavens, They ſeem'd
to turn upon another Axis, or other Poles than they
did before, and different from thoſe of the Sun or the
Earth. And this fundamental change in the Site of
the Earth had a further chain of conſequences, as is
noted by the Theoriſt, in reference to the ſtate both
of the Animate and Inanimate World. This is in ſhort,
the ſtate of the caſe, which is ſometimes expreſs'd in
different terms, eſpecially by the Ancients, who ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
followed another Syſtem of the Heavens and
the Earth, and were not always accurate in their
expreſſions.</p>

This Author would ſquare and conform all the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets
to the model of the preſent Earth. Whereas
there is <hi>diverſity of adminiſtrations,</hi> in the Natural
World, as well as Spiritual, yet the ſame Providence
every where. The Axes of the Planets are not all paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel
to that of the Sun, nor all oblique: And thoſe
that are ſo, have not all the ſame degree of obliquity,
yet we have reaſon to think them all habitable. In
ſome there are no different Seaſons of the Year, and
in ſome they differ in another manner than ours:
and the periods of their Years are very different. In
like manner as to the Days, in ſome they are longer,
in others ſhorter. In the <hi>Moon</hi> a day laſts fourteen
or fifteen of our Days: and their Nights are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably
longer than our Nights. In <hi>Jupiter,</hi>
the Days are but of five hours, and ſo the Nights:
that Planet being turned in ten hours about his Axis.
In <hi>Mercury</hi> we know little what the Seaſons or Days
are, but its Year muſt be much ſhorter than ours:
As alſo is that of <hi>Venus:</hi> And their heat from the
Sun muſt be much greater. <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Saturn</hi> are at
vaſt diſtances from the Sun, and muſt proportionably
have leſs heat: And <hi>Saturn</hi> muſt have a greater diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of Summer and Winter than we have, by reaſon
of his greater obliquity to the Sun. Theſe and ſuch
like obſervations, ſhow, what vanity it is to make an
univerſal ſtandard from the ſtate of our Earth. Or
to ſay, This is beſt, and to make things otherwiſe
would be inconſiſtent with the <hi>infinite Wiſdom of their
Maker,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 66.</note> as this Examiner pretends to do.</p>
            <p>But to return to his Objections, This he ſuggeſts as
one,<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that in caſe of a perpetual Equinox the annual
motion of the Earth about the Sun would be to no
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:38607:16"/>
purpoſe. Of this we are no competent-Judges, no
more than of the other differences formention'd in the
conditions of the Planets. Yet in that caſe, a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and computation of Time might be made by
their aſpect to the different Signs of the Zodiack.
There may be (for any thing we know) in the extent
of the Univerſe, Planets or great opake Bodies that
have no courſe about their Sun, for reaſons beſt known
to their Maker. And others that have no diurnal
motion about their Axes. Nor ought ſuch ſtates,
tho very different from ours be concluded incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
If this Objection of his were of any force, it
would lie againſt <hi>Jupiter</hi> as well as againſt the Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diluvian
Earth. And this minds me of his objection
taken from <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter,</hi> whoſe Axes, he ſays,
are inclined to the Axis of the Ecliptick, and yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Theoriſt they have ſuffer'd no Deluge.
This is an unhappy Argument, for I think it hath two
errors in it. But let us ſet down his words, that
there may be no miſtake or miſrepreſentation.<note place="margin">P. 76.</note> 
               <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
argument which may be brought to convince the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt
that the Axis of the Earth was at firſt inclined to the
Plane of the Ecliptick, is, that it is certain by obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that</hi> Saturn <hi>and</hi> Jupiter <hi>(whom the Theoriſt will
allow to have ſuffered no Deluge as yet) have their Axes
not perpendicular but inclin'd to the Planes of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits,
and the poſition is true of all the other Planets, as
far as they can be obſerv'd. And therefore, &amp;c.</hi> Firſt, as
to <hi>Saturn,</hi> I'm ſure the Theoriſt never thought that
Planet to be now in its original form, but to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
and to have already ſuffer'd a diſſolution: as you
may ſee in both Theories,<note place="margin">Engl. p. 113, 114.</note> 
               <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Latin.</hi> Then
as to the poſition of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> I know not whence he
has this <hi>certain</hi> obſervation,<note place="margin">Lat. p. 107.</note> that its Axis is oblique
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:38607:17"/>
to the Plane of its Orbit.<note place="margin">Coſmoth. p. 105.</note> For <hi>Hugenius</hi> tells us juſt
the contrary, and that it hath a perpetual Equinox.
Let theſe things be examin'd, and hereafter let us be
cautious how we take things upon the Examiner's
word, if he be found to have committed two faults
in one Objection.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, He intimates (p. 94.) that the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt
hath no mind to the notion of <hi>Attraction;</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
ſo too, nor in Philoſophy to any other notion
that is unconceivable. He muſt tell us how this <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction</hi>
differs from an <hi>Occult Quality:</hi> Whether it
is a Mechanical Principle or no: And if not, from
what Principle it ariſes. When he hath told us this,
we ſhall be better able to judge of it.</p>
            <p>After all, to conclude this Chapter, The one grand
queſtion with the Theoriſt, (whatſoever there may be
with other Authors) is this, <hi>Whether</hi> the Earth has
chang'd its ſituation ſince the beginning of the World:
And that it has done ſo, the Theoriſt does ſtill poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
maintain.</p>
            <p>Having inſiſted more largely upon theſe Four Firſt
Chapters, as being moſt Fundamental in the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,

            <p>This Fifth Chapter is deſigned againſt the Rivers of
the Primitive Earth, according to that origin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation
that is given them by the Theoriſt. But it is
to be noted in the firſt place, That ſuppoſing they had
any other origin or courſe than what is there aſſign'd,
(excepting only an origin from Mountains) the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:38607:17"/>
               <hi>Theory</hi> continues ſtill in force. For this point about
the Waters of the Firſt Earth and the explication of
them, is one of thoſe explications that admit of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
and variety, and therefore as to the <hi>Theory,</hi> the
queſtion is only this, <hi>Whether</hi> an habitable Earth may
have Rivers without Mountains. For if any Earth
may have them without Mountains, why not the
Primitive Earth? Now it will be hard for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminer,
or any other to prove, That in every
World where there are Waters and Rivers, there are
Mountains alſo. We intimated before, that the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
frame of an Earth might be ſuch as would give
a courſe to Waters without particular Mountains.
But we will leave that at preſent to a further conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
and obſerve now what his proofs are that
there could be no Rivers in the Primitive Earth.</p>
            <p>Firſt he ſays,<note place="margin">P. 87.</note> 
               <hi>According to the Theoriſt's own Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
there could be no Rivers for a long time after the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Earth.</hi> Where is this ſaid by the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oriſt?
His Hypotheſis ſuppoſes that the ſoft and moiſt
Earth could not but afford ſtore of Vapours at firſt;
as this Author in another place hath noted for the
ſence of the Theoriſt <hi>(p.</hi> 86.) and now he ſays the
quite contrary. The Chanels of the Rivers indeed
would not be ſo deep and hollow at firſt as they are
now, their cavities being wrought by degrees: but
ſtill there would not want Vapours to ſupply them.</p>
            <p>Then he ſays when that firſt moiſture of the Earth
was leſſened,<note place="margin">P. 88.</note> there could be no ſupply of Vapours
from the Abyſs: ſeeing the heat of the Sun could
not reach ſo far, nor raiſe Vapours from it, or at leaſt
not in a ſufficient quantity: As he pretends to prove
hereafter. But in the mean time he ſpeaks of great
cracks or pits, whoſe dimenſions and capacities he exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:38607:18"/>
at pleaſure, and by theſe he makes the Theoriſt
to ſuppoſe the Vapours to aſcend. Now I do not
find that the Theoriſt makes any mention of theſe Pits,
nor any uſe of thoſe cracks for that purpoſe. The
only queſtion is, Whether the heat of the Sun in that
Earth would reach ſo low as the Abyſs, when the
Earth was more dry'd, and its pores enlarg'd. So
that this objection as he ſtates it, ſeems to refer to
ſome other Author.</p>
            <p>But now ſuppoſing the Vapours rais'd, he conſiders
what courſe they would take, or which way they would
move in the open Air. But before that be examin'd,
we muſt take notice how unfairly he deals with the
Theoriſt, when he ſeems to make him ſuppoſe that
Mountains <hi>make way for the motion and dilatation of
Vapours.</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 94, 95.</note> Which he never ſuppos'd, nor is it poſſible
he ſhould ſuppoſe it in the Firſt Earth where there
were no Mountains. Neither does the Theoriſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
as this Author would inſinuate, that Mountains
or Cold dilate Vapours, but on the contrary, that
they <hi>ſtop and compreſs them,</hi> as the words are cited
even by the Examiner a little before, <hi>p.</hi> 86.</p>
            <p>Then as to the courſe of the Vapours when they
are rais'd, The Theoriſt ſuppoſes that would be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Poles and the coldeſt Climates. But this
Author ſays, They would all move Weſtward, or
from Eaſt to Weſt:<note place="margin">P. 97.</note> 
               <hi>There being a continual wind
blowing from the Eaſt to Weſt, according to the motion of
the Sun.</hi> Whether that Wind come from the motion
of the Sun, or of the Earth (which is contrary) is
another queſtion, but however let them move at firſt
to the Weſt, the queſtion here is, <hi>Where they would
be condens'd,</hi> or where they would fall. And there is
little probability that their condenſation would be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:38607:18"/>
under the Equator where they are moſt agitated,
but rather by an impulſe of new vapours they
would ſoon divert towards the Poles: And loſing
their agitation there, would fall in Dews or Rains.
Which condenſation being made, and a paſſage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd
that way for new ones to ſupply their places,
there would be a continual draught of Vapours
from the hotter to the colder parts of the Earth.</p>
            <p>We proceed now to the Seventh Chapter, which
is in a good meaſure upon the ſame or a like
ſubject with this, namely concerning the penetrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the heat of the Sun into the Body of the
Earth.<note place="margin">P. 148.</note> This, he ſays, cannot be to any conſiderable
depth: nor could it paſs the exteriour Orb of the
firſt Earth, and affect the Abyſs or raiſe vapours
from it. To prove this, he ſuppoſes that exteriour
Earth divided into ſo many ſurfaces as he pleaſes,
then ſuppoſing the heat diminiſh'd in every ſurface,
he concludes it could not poſſibly paſs through ſo
many. Thus you may divide an Inch into an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
or a thouſand ſurfaces, and prove from thence
that no heat of the Sun could pierce through an
Inch of Earth. We muſt rather conſider Pores than
Surfaces in this caſe, and whether thoſe Pores
were ſtraight or oblique the motion would paſs
however, 'tho not the Light. And the heat of
the Sun might have its effect, by a direct or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
motion, to a great depth within the Earth, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the multitude of Surfaces that he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines.
Thoſe that think a Comet, upon its nearer
approach to the Sun, would be pierc'd with its heat
through and through; and to ſuch a degree as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
much hotter than red hot Iron, will not think it
ſtrange that at our diſtance from the Sun its heat
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:38607:19"/>
ſhould have ſome proportionable effect upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
parts of the Earth. And all thoſe imaginary
ſolid Surfaces do not hinder, you ſee, the Magnetick
particles from running through the Body of the Earth,
and making the Globe one great Magnet.</p>
            <p>But let thoſe conſiderations have what effect they
can, this ſuppoſition however is nothing peculiar to
the Theoriſt. I know ſome learned men think the
heat of the Sun does penetrate deep into the bowels
of the Earth; Others think it does not, and either
of them have their arguments. Theſe alledge the
equal temper of Vaults and Mines at different ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of the year: The other ſay 'tis true, ſubterrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
places keep their equality of temper much better
than the external Air, and thoſe differences that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to us are in a great meaſure by compariſon
with the temper of our Bodies. Then for their own
opinion, they take an argument from the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Metals and Minerals in the bowels of the
Earth, and other Subterraneous foſſiles. Theſe we
ſee are ripen'd by degrees in ſeveral ages, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
as they think, be brought to Maturity and raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the exteriour Earth, without the heat and
influence of the Sun. Of the ſame Sun that actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
all the Vegetable World, that quickens Seeds
and raiſes Juices into the roots of our deepeſt and
tops of our higheſt Oakes and Cedars.</p>
            <p>But let this remain a Problem; I will inſtance in
another remarkable Phaenomenon which is moſt for
the preſent purpoſe, I mean Earthquakes. Let us
conſider the Cauſes of them, and the Depths of them.
I think all agree that Earthquakes ariſe from the
rarefaction of Vapours and Exhalations, and that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:38607:19"/>
this rarefaction muſt be made by ſome heat; and no
other is yet prov'd to us by this Author than that of
the Sun. Then as to the depth of Earthquakes, we
find they are deeper than the bottom of the Sea. For,
beſides that they communicate with different Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
divided by the Sea, they are found ſometimes
to ariſe within the Sea and from the bottom of it,
at great depths. This ſeems to prove that there may
be a ſtrong rarefaction of Vapours and Exhalations far
within the bowels of the Earth: and the Theoriſt
deſires no more. If in the preſent conſtitution of the
Earth there may be ſuch Concuſſions and Subverſions
for a great extent, we have no reaſon to believe but
there might be (at a time appointed by Providence)
an Univerſal Diſruption, as that Earth was conſtituted.
Finally, Whatſoever the cauſes of this Diſruption and
Diſſolution were, 'tis certain there was a <hi>Diſruption of
the Abyſs,</hi> and that Diſruption Univerſal as the Deluge
was: which anſwers ſufficiently the deſign of the
<hi>Theory.</hi> However if he have a mind to ſee how this
agrees with Hiſtory, both Sacred and Prophane, he
may conſult, if he pleaſe, what the Theoriſt hath
noted upon that argument, <hi>Archaeol. l. 2. c.</hi> 4. beſides
other places.</p>
            <p>But this Author ſays further, That ſuppoſing ſuch
a Diſruption of the Abyſs, and Diſſolution of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
Earth, no Univerſal Deluge however could
follow upon it: becauſe there could not be Water
enough left in the Abyſs to make or occaſion ſuch a
Deluge: For the Rivers of the Earth being then ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
from the Abyſs, by ſuch a time, or before the
time of the Deluge, he ſays there would be no Water
left in it. Thus he goes from one extream to another:
Before he ſaid the power of the Sun could not reach
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:38607:20"/>
or affect the Abyſs to draw out any Vapours from
it, now he would make the Evaporation ſo exceſſive,
that it would have emptied the great Abyſs before the
Deluge. This is a great undertaking, and to make it
good he takes a great compaſs. He pretends to ſhow
us what quantity of Water all the Rivers of the
Earth throw into the Sea every day; and beginning
with the River <hi>Po,</hi> and taking his meaſure from that,
he ſuppoſes there are ſuch a certain number of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
Rivers upon the face of the whole Earth; and
if the <hi>Po</hi> caſts ſo much Water into the Sea, the reſt
will caſt ſo much more, and in concluſion ſo much as
would empty the Abyſs.</p>
            <p>You will eaſily believe, <hi>Sir,</hi> there muſt be great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties
in this computation. But if that was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
as it is far from it, ſtill he goes upon ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that are not allowed by the Theoriſt. For firſt,
He ſuppoſes the waters of the preſent Sea to be equal
to the Waters of the Great Abyſs: Whereas ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
them of the ſame depth, there would be near
twice as much Water in the <hi>Great Deep</hi> as is now in
the Ocean: ſeeing the Abyſs was extended under the
whole Earth, and the Sea reaches but to half of it.
Secondly, He ſhould prove that the Rivers of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tediluvian
Earth were as many and as great as we have
now. The Torrid Zone then had none, and much
leſs would ſerve the Temperate Climates than is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſit
now for the whole Earth. Beſides, The Rivers of
that Earth were not ſupply'd by Vapours only from
the Abyſs, but alſo from all the Earth, and all the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
upon the Earth: And when the Rivers were
partly loſt and ſpent in the Torrid Zone, they were in
a great meaſure exhal'd there, and drawn into the
Air by the heat of the Sun, and would fall again in
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:38607:20"/>
another place to make new Rains and a new ſupply to
the Rivers.<note place="margin">P. 158.</note> So in like manner when he ſuppoſes the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
that were upon the Earth at the time of the diſrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Great Deep, to have thrown themſelves off the
Land, as if they were loſt: and makes a computation
how much Waters all the Rivers of the Earth amount
to, This, I ſay, is a needleſs computation as to the
preſent purpoſe. For whatſoever maſs of Waters
they amounted to, it would not be loſt, if they fell
down and joyned with the Abyſs they would increaſe
its ſtore, and be thrown up again by the fall of the
fragments, making ſo much a greater maſs to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow
the Earth. So that nothing is gain'd by this
Suppoſition, the effect would be the ſame as to the
Deluge. Whether the Waters above the Earth and
thoſe under the Earth met together ſooner or later,
when their forces were joyned they would ſtill have
the ſame effect: as we ſaid before of the Vapours.
And to conclude that point, The whole ſumm of
Waters, or Vapours convertible into waters, that were
from the beginning, or at any time, would ſtill be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd
above ground or under ground: and that would
turn to the ſame account as to the Flood.</p>
            <p>Theſe Waters and Vapours all collected, the Theoriſt
ſuppoſes ſufficient, upon a diſſolution of the Earth, to
make the Deluge. Not indeed in the nature of a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Pool, as it is uſually conceiv'd. A quiet Pool, I ſay,
overtopping and ſtanding calm over the heads of the
higheſt Mountains, but, as a ruſhing Sea, overflowing and
ſweeping them with its raging Waves and impetuous flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuations,
when it was violently forc'd out of all its Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels,
and the Vapours condens'd into Rain. Such an inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
as this, would be ſufficient to deſtroy both Man
and Beaſt and other Creatures: thoſe few excepted that
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:38607:21"/>
were miraculouſly preſerv'd in the Ark. This is the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oriſt's
Explication of the Deluge, and I ſee nothing in
this Argument that will deſtroy or weaken it.</p>
            <p>Now this being the ſtate of the Deluge according
to the Theoriſt, what this Author ſays in the next Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph
<hi>(p.</hi> 167.) is either a miſrepreſentation, or an
equivocation. For the Eight Oceans requir'd by the
Theoriſt, is the quantity of Water neceſſary for a
Deluge in the way of a ſtanding Pool: whereas this
Author repreſents it as if the Theoriſt required ſo
much Water to make a Deluge upon his Hypotheſis.
This, I ſuppoſe, upon reflection, the Author cannot
but ſee to be a miſtake, or a wilful miſrepreſentation.</p>
            <p>This is the ſumm of his <hi>7th</hi> Chapter: There are
beſides ſome ſuggeſtions made which it may be were
intended for objections by the Author. As when he
ſays <hi>(p.</hi> 151.) That the heat of the Sun would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
upon the ſurface of the Earth, if it could
pierce and operate upon the Abyſs. We allow that
its heat was intolerable in the Torrid Zone, which
thereby became unhabitable: and there only the Sun
was in its full ſtrength and had its greateſt effect upon
the Abyſs. But in the other Climates, the heat would
be moderate enough: nay ſo moderate, that this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
ſays in another place, it would not be ſufficient
to ripen fruits, and in the whole, of leſs force than it
is now in the preſent conſtitution of the Earth.<note place="margin">P. 66. 69, &amp;c.</note> So
apt is contention to carry one out of one extream
into another.</p>
            <p>His laſt Objection is about the duration of the
Flood, That it could not laſt in its force 150 days,
if it had been made by a diſſolution of the Earth and
an Eruption of the Abyſs. But as this is affirm'd by him
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:38607:21"/>
without proof, ſo the contrary is ſufficiently explain'd
and made out both in the <hi>Lat.</hi> and <hi>Engliſh Theory,
p. 56. p.</hi> 52.</p>
            <p>I had forgot to tell him, That he ought not to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
as he ſeems to do, when he is emptying the
Abyſs, <hi>(p.</hi> 165.) That after the Torrid Zone was
ſoak'd with Waters by the iſſues of the Rivers, no
more Waters or Vapours were drawn from it then,
than were before, or conſequently no leſs, from the
Abyſs. For when the middle parts of the Earth had
drunk in thoſe Waters, the force of the Sun would
be leſs upon the Abyſs thorough thoſe parts, and the
Vapours would be more and greater from them than
before when they were dryer, and in the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
there needed leſs ſupplies from the Abyſs.</p>
            <p>Chap. 6. <hi>Concerning the Figure of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I deferr'd the conſideration of This Chapter to the
laſt, becauſe I thought it of more general concern,
and might deſerve a fuller diſquiſition. 'Tis now,
you know, become a common controverſie or enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>What the Figure of the Earth is.</hi> Many think it
not truly Spherical, as it was imagin'd formerly, but
a Spheroid, either oblong or oblate: that is, either
extended in length toward the Poles, like an Oval:
or, on the contrary, ſwelling in breadth under the
Equator, and ſo ſhorter than a juſt Sphere betwixt Pole
and Pole, and broader in the middle parts. 'Tis true
the Theoriſt is not directly concern'd in this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie,
becauſe he does not in the <hi>Theory</hi> affirm the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:38607:22"/>
Earth to be Oblong or Oval: not knowing what
change might be made at its diſſolution. However
it may be worth the while to enquire what Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
are brought, either from Cauſes or Effects, to
determine the Figure of the Earth, whether paſt or
preſent.</p>
            <p>'Tis eaſie indeed by Obſervation to determine that
the Earth is a Convex Body, not plain as the <hi>Epicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans</hi>
fanſied: and Convex on all ſides, and therefore
in ſome ſort Orbicular; but whether it be truly Sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical,
thoſe common Obſervations will not determine.
The Theoriſt nam'd and pointed at ſuch Obſervations
as he thought would be moſt likely to diſcover the
preciſe Figure of the Earth: As to obſerve, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
Whether the extent of a Degree was the ſame
all the Earth over, in different Latitudes or at different
Diſtances from its Equator. Then to obſerve whether
the ſhade of the Earth in a total Eclipſe of the Moon
be truly round, or any other ways irregular. And
alſo to obſerve, if towards the Poles the return of
the Sun into their Horizon be according to the rules
of a Spherical ſurface of the Earth. Let us conſider
theſe ſeparately as to the preſent Earth.</p>
            <p>As to the meaſure of a Degree in different Latitudes,
we find that Authors are not all of the ſame mind.
Some will have them unequal, and in ſuch a manner,
according to their Diſtance from the Equator, as from
that to inferr, that the Earth is Oblong. This Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
takes notice of Dr. <hi>Eiſenſmidius,</hi> as one that hath
made that obſervation, and that inference from it,
and gives him very rude words upon that occaſion,
making him a man of <hi>prodigious ſtupidity and careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 140. 143.</note>
and one that did <hi>not underſtand the firſt ſix Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:38607:22"/>
of Euclid, or indeed thoſe of common ſence.</hi> What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
this Profeſſor was, he was not the firſt that
made that obſervation and inference. For another
Mathematician, better known, had made the ſame, ſome
time before him: I mean <hi>Milliet Deſchales,</hi> in his
<hi>General Principles of Geography, Fr. l. 1. propoſ.</hi> 29. But
'tis true, he ſays, this conjecture of his, That the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of the Earth is Oval or Elliptick, would not be
well grounded if the ſhade of the Earth in Lunar
Eclipſes was found to be always perfectly round; of
which we ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak hereafter. For
this which he makes a ſcruple againſt his own opinion
is by others made an occaſion of ſuſpecting that the
Earth is really Oval. But we muſt alſo acknowledge
that the ſame <hi>Deſchales</hi> in his <hi>Latin</hi> works does not
own the obſervation, but owns the inference, which
is that the Examiner quarrels with. He owns it, I
ſay, in theſe words,<note place="margin">Geogr. l. 1. prop. 4.</note>

again, having taken notice of the various computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

Theoriſt did not aſſert either the Obſervation to be
true or the Inference, but mark'd it as an Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that deſerv'd to be enquir'd into, in order to
determine the Figure of the Earth. For it ſeems ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent,
That if the Body of the Earth be Oblong or
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:38607:23"/>
Oblate, the extent of a Degree will not be really the
ſame as if it was truly Spherical. Neither do I know
any ſingle Obſervation that would give us more light
or better help us to diſcover what the configuration
of the Earth is, than the meaſure of a Degree exactly
taken in different Latitudes.</p>
            <p>I hapned lately to be in company with a Learned
Gentleman, and amongſt other things that fell into
diſcourſe, I ask'd his opinion, What inequality there
would be in the Degrees of the Earth, in caſe it was
Oval, and where it would fall: Whether they would
be greater towards the Poles, or towards the Equator.
We were ſuddenly interrupted by the coming in of
new Company, but he ſaid he would ſend me his
Thoughts upon a little reflection; and accordingly,
after a few days he was pleaſed to ſend me this Letter.</p>

of the Earth has in no wiſe ſo great a diſproportion
as in the Figure (their difference not exceeding the
<hi>200th</hi> part at moſt) the inequality of the Degrees

near the Poles. I hope in a fortnight to have the

            <p>The Examiner would do well to conſider this, leaſt
all the reproachful characters he caſts upon <hi>Eiſenſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi>
ſhould recoil upon himſelf. 'Tis Prudence, as
well as Good Manners not to be fierce and vehement
in Cenſures, for fear of a miſtake, and a backblow.
However, the pretended demonſtration which this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminer
brings to prove, That, in caſe the Earth was
Oblong the Degrees would be greater toward the
Poles, does not affect <hi>Eiſenſmidius.</hi> for it proceeds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a ſuppoſition which that Author does not allow:
namely, That the Vertical Lines, or the Lines of Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
are to be drawn directly to the Center of the
Earth: whereas <hi>Eiſenſmidius</hi> ſuppoſes they ought to
be drawn at right Angles to the Tangent of each

            <p>We proceed now to the Theoriſt's Second Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
about Lunar Eclipſes and the Shade of the
Earth. This Shade is generally preſumed to be exactly
round, as the Section of a Cone: And yet the beſt
Aſtronomers have doubted of it, and ſome upon that
occaſion have doubted of the Figure of the Earth.

ſuſpects that the Figure of the Earth was ſo too.
And that we muſt conclude it to be ſo from this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
if there was not ſome Obliquity in the rays
of the Sun, whereof he ſhews no cauſe or occaſion.

Theſe two great Aſtronomers, it ſeems, did not find
the Shade of the Earth to be juſtly Conical. And
thereby take away the reaſon or leſſen the doubt
which hindred <hi>M. Deſchales</hi> from concluding (upon
another Obſervation) the Figure of the Earth to be
Oval.</p>
            <p>The Third Obſervation of the Theoriſt's remains,
which is about the return of the Sun unto the Polar
parts of the Earth, whether that be according to the
rules of a Spherical Surface. The Obſervations that
have been made hitherto in the Northern Climates
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:38607:25"/>
about the return of the Sun to them, make it quicker
than will eaſily conſiſt with a Spherical Figure of the
Earth: much leſs are they favourable to a Gibbous
Form. For that gibboſity under the Equator muſt
needs hinder the appearance and diſcovery of the Sun
in the reſpective Polar parts more than a Spherical Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
would do. Now it hath been obſerv'd in <hi>Nova

days ſooner than they expected according to the rules
of Aſtronomy, the Earth being ſuppoſed truly Sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical:
and this may be thought an Argument that the
Earth is rather depreſt in its middle parts. I leave the
matter to further examination. I know 'tis uſually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to Refractions, but that is upon the preſumption
that the Earth is juſtly Spherical: and a better an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
(upon that ſuppoſition) I think cannot be found.
Tho, I think, it will not be eaſie in that way, and upon
that ſolution to make all the Phaenomena agree, or to
ſhew that the Refractions could make ſo great a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
However this is no improper Topick to be
conſider'd in reference to the determination of the
Figure of the Earth, and for that purpoſe it was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the Theoriſt.</p>
            <p>We have now done with that ſide of the Queſtion
that reſpects the Oblong Figure of the Earth, and it
remains to conſider the other part: I mean the opinion
of thoſe that make the Earth protuberant about the
Equator,<note place="margin">Diſc. de la Peſant. p. 145, &amp;c.</note> or an oblate Spheroid. This the Learned
Monſieur <hi>Hugens</hi> thinks may be prov'd by experiments
made about the different Vibrations of <hi>Pendulums</hi> in
different Latitudes of the Earth. 'Tis found, he ſays,
by experience that a <hi>Pendulum</hi> near the Equator makes
its Vibrations ſlower than another of the ſame length
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:38607:25"/>
further from the Equator. And gives an inſtance of
it from an experiment made at <hi>Caiene</hi> in <hi>America</hi>
(which is 4 or 5 degrees from the Equator) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
with another made at <hi>Paris.</hi> From this Tryal
he concludes, firſt, that the gravitation is leſs under
and near the Equator than towards the Poles, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their ſeveral degrees of Latitude. Then
he infers by conſequence, that the Land and the Sea
are higher towards the Equator than towards the
Poles. And in concluſion, That the figure of the
Earth is Protuberant and Gibbous in the Middle, and
more flatted or of a ſhorter Diameter betwixt Pole
and Pole.</p>
            <p>In this concluſion you ſee there are ſeveral things
to be conſidered according to the Premiſes. Firſt
matter of Fact, concerning the inequality of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations
in equal Pendulums according to their
different Latitudes: then the following inferences
made from tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> inequality. As to matter of fact,
Monſieur <hi>Hugens</hi> ſeems to be doubtful himſelf. He
does not vouch it from his own experience, but
he takes it from the report of Monſieur <hi>Richer:</hi>
whoſe Perſon or Character I do not know, nor
whether his relation be Extant in Print. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Monſieur <hi>Hugens</hi> ſpeaks dubiouſly of the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,
as ſuch an one whereof we ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
further Confirmation.<note place="margin">Ibid p. 149.</note> For he ſays, <hi>we cannot
Truſt entirely to this firſt obſervation, whereof we have
not any circumſtance noted to us: and ſtill leſs to thoſe
that are ſaid to be made at</hi> Guadaloupe, <hi>(at a greater
Latitude) where the Pendule is ſaid to be ſhorter by two
lines than that at Paris. We muſt expect to be more juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inform'd of theſe different lengths of Pendules,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 166.</note> 
               <hi>as well
under the Line as in other Climates.</hi> And he refers
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:38607:26"/>
us to a further trial by his Clocks rectified for a
ſecond voyage, whereof I have yet heard no report.
If matter of Fact be dubious, or experiments diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordant,
we cannot be aſſured of the Concluſion.
It were to be wiſh'd, That this different gravitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in different Latitudes might be prov'd by other
experiments than that of the Pendulum. Methinks
in ponderous Bodies this difference might become
Senſible: Not indeed by a Balance or Scales, for
the ſuppoſed decreaſe of Gravity would have
the ſame effect upon the Counterpoiſe as upon the
Body weighed, but by other Powers that do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
immediately upon Gravity, as <hi>Springs</hi> or any
other Engines, or by rarefactions, or whatſoever hath
the force to raiſe, ſuſtain, or remove ponderous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
For ſuch Powers muſt have a leſs effect with
us than near the Equator, where the gravitation of
Bodies that make the counterpoiſe, is ſuppoſed
to be much leſſen'd. Neither do I know if they
have try'd the Barometer, whether that will di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
any ſuch elevation at or near the Equator: the
Mercury ſinking there much lower than with us, or
indeed to nothing, if the height be comparatively ſo
great as is ſuppoſ'd. It ſeems ſtrange that the difference
of 17 Miles (call it little, or call it great, compar'd
with the ſemidiameter of the Earth) ſhould have a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
effect upon Pendulums and upon nothing elſe.</p>
            <p>Methinks, that height of the Equator ſhould make
a different Horizon (as to the Heavens, or the Earth
and Sea) Eaſt and Weſt, from North and South; The
figure of the Earth being a Sphere one way and a
Spheroid in the other. The Sea alſo muſt be of a
prodigious depth at the Equator, deeper by Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Miles than at or near the Poles. I would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:38607:26"/>
know what experience there is of this. Then in
reference to our <hi>Rivers,</hi> How ſwift and rapid, upon
this Hypotheſis, muſt the <hi>Rivers</hi> be that riſe at or
near the Equator, or how ſlow the motion of thoſe
that aſcend towards it, if at all they can be ſuppoſed
to clime ſo great an Hill. The great River of the
<hi>Amazons,</hi> in Southern <hi>America,</hi> is in ſome parts of it
four or five degrees from the Equator, others ſay
much more, Yet runs up to the Equator with that
vaſt load of water, and throws it ſelf there into
the Ocean. In the Northern <hi>America, Rio Negro</hi> is
repreſented to us as having a longer courſe againſt
the bent of the Earth, and croſſing the Equator,
falls down Southward ſeveral Degrees. So the <hi>Nile</hi>
in <hi>Africa</hi> croſſes the Line and hath a long courſe
on this ſide of it. <hi>Rivers</hi> do not riſe higher by a
natural courſe than their Fountain's head, and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drographers
uſually aſſign two foot or two foot
and an half in a Mile for the deſcent of <hi>Rivers,</hi>
but upon this Hypotheſis there will be fourteen
or fifteen foot (in reſpect of the center of the Earth)
for every Mile, in Rivers deſcending from the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
which is a Precipitation rather than a Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Stream. Suppoſe a Canal cut from the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
to the Pole, t'would be a paradox to ſay the
water would not flow in this Chanel, nor deſcend
towards the Pole having Fourteen or Fifteen foot
deſcent for every Mile, according to your figure of
the Earth. And alſo it would be as great or a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Paradox to ſuppoſe that Rivers would riſe to the
Equator, and with the ſame celerity (as we ſee they
do) upon an aſcent of ſo many feet. And after all, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the argument, If this difference of Pendulums
be found, it will ſtill bear a diſpute from what Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:38607:27"/>
Cauſes that difference Proceeds.</p>
            <p>Thus far we have conſidered what arguments
have been brought for the oblate figure of the Earth,
from Effects: and have noted ſuch obſervations to
be made as we thought might be uſeful for diſcovery
of Truth, on what ſide ſoever it may fall. We are
now to conſider an argument taken from the Cauſes,
and brought by theſe Authors to prove the ſame
ſpheroidical figure of the Globe. To this purpoſe
they obſerve, as is obvious and reaſonable, that in
the diurnal motion of the Earth the middle parts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the Equator (where the circles are greateſt, and
conſequently the motion ſwifteſt) would fly off with
a greater force, and ſo riſe higher than the other
parts that were mov'd in leſſer circles in the ſame
time, and would have leſs force to remove themſelves
from the center of their Motion. This is agreed on
all hands, and was own'd by the Theoriſt in a fluid
Globe turn'd about it's Axis, in caſe there was no
impediment to hinder the riſing or receſſion of thoſe
middle parts. But before we ſpeak to that, on both
ſides you ſee it muſt be ſuppos'd and granted That
the Globe of the Earth was once Fluid, or the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Orb of it: and we ought to conſider when, or
at what time that was. It muſt have been ſurely at
the firſt formation of the Earth when it riſe from a
Chaos, and before its parts were Conſolidated and
grown Hard. Suppoſing then that the interiour Orb
of the Earth was once cover'd over with an Orb of
water, The queſtion will be, How this Orb of
water came to be cover'd with dry Land, or came
to be divided into Land and Water, as it is Now.</p>
            <p>Let (A) repreſent an Hemiſphere of the Earth, in
its firſt ſtate, when covered with Water: And (B)
<pb facs="tcp:38607:27"/>
               <figure/>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:38607:28"/>
the ſame Hemiſphere as it is now. This Author muſt
tell us, conſiſtently with his Hypotheſis, How the
Earth could paſs out of one of theſe ſtates into the
other without paſſing thorough ſome intermediate
ſtate; or how this change was made in its ſurface,
from what cauſes and in what manner. If the Firſt
Earth was a Concretion upon the face of the Waters,
then indeed it would have the ſame Figure with the
watery Globe under it; but if it was from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in this preſent Form, firm and ſolid as it is now,
Rocky and Mountainous, then the Queſtion is, <hi>How</hi>
the parts or regions of the Earth about the Equator
could be raiſed above a Spherical Figure, or into an
oblate Spheroid, as they ſay the Earth is now. I take
it for granted, that they ſuppoſe the Land raiſed as
well as the Water: for otherwiſe the Ocean would
overflow at thoſe parts of the Earth. Suppoſe then
the Waters raiſed by the circumvolution of the Earth,
how was the <hi>Terra firma</hi> rais'd, or how could it be
rais'd by that or any ſuch cauſe?</p>
            <p>Theſe Queſtions are no matter of difficulty to the
Theoriſt, who ſuppoſes the Firſt Earth to have covered
the Waters, and to have taken their ſhape, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
it was, as upon a mould. Then upon its Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
and Diſruption at the Deluge, to have faln in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that uneven and interrupted Form it hath now. But
ſeeing this method does not pleaſe the Examiner, He
muſt tell us how, upon his Hypotheſis, the Land or
ſolid parts of the Earth could be rais'd above a Sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
Convexity into ſuch a gibbous Figure as he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
them now to have under the Equator.</p>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:38607:28"/>
the Earth to have been the effect of Gravity in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the Earth: the matter whereof being then
turned round, it would, as he thinks, be brought to
ſettle in this Oblate Figure. Very well! but this muſt
be in its very firſt Concretion from a Chaos, before it
was fixt and compact as it is now; For the rotation of
the Earth could have no ſuch effect upon it after it was
hard. Now if you admit the exteriour Globe of the
Earth, to have been in ſuch a ſtate betwixt fixtneſs
and fluidity, it will lead us directly to the Theoriſt's
Hypotheſis, which ſuppoſes a ſoft and tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
at firſt over all the face of the Waters. I ſay,
<hi>over all the face of the Waters,</hi> for it muſt be Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,
both becauſe there is no reaſon why theſe earthy
Particles that made the Concretion ſhould not fall upon
one part of the Globe as well as upon another; and alſo
if they did not fall upon the Equinoctial parts, how
came there to be Land in that part, or that Land rais'd
higher than the reſt, as this Hypotheſis will have it.</p>
            <p>In theſe remarks upon the protuberant Figure of
the Earth, you ſee it is allow'd, that there would be a
greater tendency from the Center in the middle parts
of the Globe, and the Waters would riſe there, if
there was no impediment. But the Theoriſt did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that the Vortex, or circumfluent Orb was
ſtreighter, or of a ſhorter diameter there than tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
the Poles: and conſequently the Waters having
leſs room to dilate, would be preſs'd and detruded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Poles. Theſe Authors, it may be, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
no Vortices to the Planets, but then they muſt
aſſign ſome other ſufficient cauſe to carry the Planets
in their periodical motions (and with the ſame velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
for innumerable ages) about their common Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and the ſecondary about their primary. As alſo
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:38607:29"/>
what gives them their diurnal rotation, and the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
poſition of their Axes. Neither would it be eaſie
to conceive how a great maſs of fluid and volatile
matter, having no current, or determination any one
way, and being often checkt in its progreſſive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſhould not fall into circular motions, or into Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices
of one ſort or other. Eſpecially if you place in this
maſs ſome great ſolid Bodies turned about their Axes.</p>
            <p>Theſe are more general Problems, and when they
are determin'd with certainty, we ſhall better judge
of the particulars that depend upon them. But I ſay
ſtill, that neither Figure of the Earth, Oblong or Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
can be prov'd from the rotation of the Earth and
its gravity, without ſuppoſing the Globe form'd into
that ſhape before it came to be hardned, before it came
to be loaded and ſtifned by Rocks and ſtony Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
Therefore upon both Hypotheſes it muſt be
allow'd that there was ſuch a time, ſuch a ſtate of the
Earth, when its tender Orb was capable of thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
and modifications; and that Orb muſt have
lain above the Waters, not under them, nor radica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the bottom of them, for then ſuch Cauſes could
not have had ſuch an effect upon it. And in the laſt
place, This Concretion upon the Waters muſt have been
throughout all the parts of the Earth, or all the parts of
the Land which are now rais'd above a Spherical Surface:
and no reaſon can be given, as we noted before, why
the reſt ſhould not be cover'd as well as thoſe. So that in
effect both the Hypotheſes ſuppoſe that all the watery
Globe was at firſt cover'd with an earthy Concretion.</p>
            <p>Now this being admitted, you have confirm'd the
main point of the <hi>Theory:</hi> namely, That the Abyſs was
once, or at firſt cover'd with a terreſtrial Concretion,
or an Orb of Earth. Grant this and we'll compound
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:38607:29"/>
for the reſt, let the Earth at preſent be of what Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
it will. If there was ſuch an original Earth
that cover'd the Waters, both the form and equili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
of that Earth may eaſily appear, and how by
a diſſolution of it a Deluge might ariſe. But as to
the preſent Earth, the Theoriſt never affirm'd that
its Figure was Oval,<note place="margin">Lat. Theor. lib. 2. p. 185.</note> but he noted ſuch obſervations
made or to be made, as he thought might be proper
to determine its Figure: and ſtill deſires that they
may be purſued. He added alſo that he would be
glad to receive any new ones, that would demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
the preciſe Figure of the Earth. And accordingly
he is willing to conſider in this particular and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
the Arguments and Remarks of ſuch Eminent
Authors, as have lately given a new light to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem
of the World.</p>
            <p>This may ſuffice to have ſpoken in general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
theſe two ſpheroidical Figures of the Earth.
We muſt now conſider what particular objections
are made by the Examiner againſt its Oval Figure.
He ſays,<note place="margin">p. 103, 104, &amp;c.</note> admitting the Oval Figure of that firſt
Earth, it would not be capable however to give a
courſe to the Rivers from the Polar Parts towards
the Equinoctial. And his reaſon is this, becauſe
the ſame Cauſes which caſt the Abyſs or the Ocean
towards the Poles, would alſo keep the Rivers from
deſcending from the Poles. But there is no parity of
reaſon betwixt the Abyſs or the Ocean and the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
We ſee in the flux and reflux of the Ocean,
let the Cauſe of it be what it will, it hath not that
effect upon Rivers, nor upon Lakes, nor upon leſſer
Seas: Yet the circumrotation of the Earth continues
the ſame. And his confounding the Ocean and Rivers
in the Antediluvian Earth is ſo much the worſe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:38607:30"/>
there never was an Ocean and Rivers together
in that Earth, While there was an open Ocean there
were no Rivers, and when there were Rivers there
was no open Ocean, but an inclos'd Abyſs. So
'tho he makes large Tranſcripts there and elſewhere
out of the Theory, he does not ſeem always to have
well digeſted the method of it.</p>
            <p>After this objection, th' Examiner charges the
Theoriſt with want of Skill in Logick: but his charge
is grounded upon another Miſunderſtanding or Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation.
He pretends there, that the Theoriſt
hath made ſuch a Ratiocination as this.<note place="margin">P. 107.</note>

to be; let every one be Tryed by their own Words,
and if there be any falſe Logick or nonſence in the

(which follows indeed from his own words, but
not from thoſe of the Theoriſt) <hi>Becauſe all Bodies
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:38607:30"/>
do endeavour to recede from the Axis of their motion,
therefore they will endeavour to go to the Axis of their
motion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Theoriſt's argumentation was plainly this, See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the rotation of the Earth Bodies tend from the
Center of their motion, if they meet with an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment
there, they will move laterally in the next,
eaſieſt and openeſt way: and therefore the Waters
under the Equator being ſtop'd in their firſt tendency,
would divert towards the Poles. Wherein, I think,
there is no falſe Logick. That there was no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
there, he muſt prove by other Arguments than
his own dictates or bare aſſertion, which will not paſs
for a proof.</p>
            <p>He proceeds now to diſcourſe of the Centrifugal
force and the effects of it, together with gravity. But
he ſhould have given us a better notion of the Centri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugal
force than what he ſets down there; for he ſays,
<hi>(p. 110. l.</hi> 24.) <hi>A Centrifugal force, is that force by which
a Body is drawn towards the Center.</hi> This is a ſtrange
ſignification of that word.<note place="margin">P. 11</note> And in the next page <hi>(l.</hi>
22.) he ſays, by this Centrifugal force Bodies <hi>endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to recede from the Center of their motion,</hi> which is
true, but contrary to what he ſaid juſt before. I
think 'tis Gravity not Centrifugal force, that brings
Bodies towards the Center.</p>
            <p>But to paſs by this contradiction, and to proceed:
What he ſays, from other Authors, about the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
of the Centrifugal force and Gravity in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
turn'd round, and particularly in Fluids, how
they would fly off more or leſs according to the Circles
of their motion, was always (as hath been mention'd
before) ſuppos'd and allow'd by the Theoriſt, if there
was no reſtraint or preſſure upon one part more than
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:38607:31"/>
another of the fluid Globe. So that he might have
ſpared here ſix or ſeven pages.</p>
            <p>In like manner, he might have ſpar'd what he hath
tranſcrib'd in his following Pages from thoſe excellent
Authors we referr'd to before, about calculating the
diminutions of Gravity made by the Centrifugal
force, in different Latitudes: with other ſuch excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
Theſe, I ſay, might have been ſpar'd, as need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
upon this occaſion, or to the confutation of the
<hi>Theory,</hi> till the principal point, upon which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend,
be better prov'd. I made bold to ſay, they
were tranſcrib'd from thoſe Authors, as any one may
ſee that pleaſe to conſult the Originals <hi>Newt. Philoſ.
Nat. princ. math. l. 3. prop. 18, 19, 20. Hugens Diſcourſ.
de la cauſe de la Peſanteur, p. 147, 148, &amp;c.</hi> And this
<hi>French</hi> Diſcourſe of Monſieur <hi>Hugens,</hi> he hath not ſo
much as once nam'd, tho he hath taken ſo much from
it. And after all, when theſe things are determin'd
in Speculation, it will ſtill be a queſtion what the
True Phyſical Cauſes of them are.</p>
            <p>At laſt, for a further confirmation of the broad
Spheroidical Figure of the Earth, he adds an Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
from the Planet <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which is found to be
of ſuch a Figure.<note place="margin">137, 138.</note> And <hi>therefore,</hi> he ſays, <hi>We need not
doubt</hi> but that the Earth, <hi>which is a Planet like the reſt,
and turns round its Axis, as they do, is of the ſame Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</hi>
He might as well conclude that every Planet,
as well as the Earth, is of the ſame Figure. And what
reaſon can he give, why all the Planets that have a
Rotation upon their Axis, are not broad Spheroids as
well as thoſe two which he ſuppoſes to be ſo? If that be
a ſufficient Cauſe and be found in other Planets as
well as thoſe, why hath it not the ſame effect? Or he
might as well conclude, That the Earth hath a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:38607:31"/>
Equinox becauſe <hi>Jupiter</hi> hath ſo. This is the
ſame fault which he hath ſo often committed, of
meaſuring all the Works of God by one or two. If
a Man was tranſported into the Moon, the neareſt Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net:
or into <hi>Mercury</hi> that is ſo near the Sun, or into
<hi>Saturn,</hi> (or any of his <hi>Satellites)</hi> that is ſo remote
from it: would he not find, think you, a much diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
face and ſtate of thoſe Planets, from what we
have upon this Earth? Inhabitants of a different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
the furniture of every World different,
Animals, Plants, Waters, and other Inanimate Things.
As alſo different viciſſitudes of Days and Nights, and
the Seaſons of the Year; according to their different
Poſitions, Revolutions and Forms. Therefore not
without reaſon we noted before, how much the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs
of ſome Mens Spirits, Thoughts and Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
confine them to a particular Pattern and Model,
not conſidering the infinite variety of the Divine
Works, whereof we are not competent Judges.</p>
            <p>Now comes in his rude cenſure of Dr. <hi>Eiſenſmidius,</hi>
both for his Mathematicks and bad Logick, or want
of <hi>common Sence;</hi> But to this we have ſpoken before.
He alſo in the ſame Paragraph wonders at the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt's
ſtrange Logick,<note place="margin">P. 142.</note> to make the Centrifugal force of
Bodies upon the Earth to be the cauſe of its Oblong
Figure. That indeed would be ſtrange Logick if it
was made the proximate cauſe of it. But that is not
the Theoriſt's Logick but the Examiner's, as it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorted
and miſrepreſented by him. The Theoriſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
the preſſure of that tumour of the Waters oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd
by the Centrifugal force (as its original Cauſe)
to be the immediate Cauſe of the Oblong Figure of
the Earth; and that preſſure ſuppos'd there is nothing
illogical in the inference. He had formerly taken
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:38607:32"/>
notice of this reaſon from the ſtreightneſs of the Orb
in that part,<note place="margin">P. 102, 103.</note> when he gave the Theoriſt's account of
that Figure, but he thought fit to forget it now, that
his charge might not appear lame.</p>
            <p>This, <hi>Sir,</hi> is a ſhort account of this Author's Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections;
But there are ſome things ſo often repeated
by him, that we are forc'd to take notice of them
more than once: As that about Miracles and Final
Cauſes. He truly notes that to be <hi>a much eaſier and
ſhorter way of giving an account of the Deluge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">P. 31.</note> or other
Revolutions of Nature: But the queſtion is not, which
is the ſhorteſt and eaſieſt way, but which is the trueſt.
No Man in his ſences can queſtion the Divine Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
God could do theſe things purely miraculouſly,
if he pleas'd, but the thing to be conſider'd is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
according to the methods of Providence in the
Changes and Revolutions of the Natural World, the
Courſe of Nature and of Natural Cauſes is not made
uſe of ſo far as they will go. Both <hi>Moſes</hi> and S. <hi>Peter</hi>
mention Material Cauſes, but always including the
Divine Word and Superintendency. The Theoriſt
does not think (as is ſufficiently teſtified in ſeveral places)
that purely Material and Mechanical Cauſes, guided
only by the Laws of Motion, could form this Earth,
and the furniture of it: and does readily believe all
Miracles recorded in Holy Writ, or elſewhere well
grounded. But Miracles of our own making or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining,
want Authority to ſupport them. Some Men
when they are at a loſs in the progreſs of their work,
call in a Miracle to relieve them in their diſtreſs.<note place="margin">Plat. Cratyl. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

As to Final Cauſes, the Contemplation of them is
very uſeful to moral purpoſes, and of great ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the Mind where we can attain to them. But we
muſt not pretend to prove a thing to be ſo or ſo in
Nature, becauſe we fancy it would be better ſo. Nor
deny it to be in ſuch a manner, becauſe to our mind
it would be better otherwiſe. Almighty Power and
Wiſdom that have the whole complex and compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Univerſe in View, take other meaſures
than we can comprehend or account for. Even in
this ſmall Earth that we inhabit, there are ſeveral
Plants and Animals which to us appear uſeleſs or
noxious, and yet no doubt would be found proper
for this ſtate, if we had the whole proſpect and Scheme
of Providence. As to Efficient Cauſes, they muſt be
either Material or Immaterial: and whatſoever is
prov'd to be the Immediate Effect of an Immaterial
Cauſe is ſo much the more acceptable to the Theoriſt
as it argues a Power above Matter. But as to purely
Material Cauſes, they muſt be Mechanical: There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no other Modes, or Powers of Matter (at leaſt in
the opinion of the Theoriſt) but what are Mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.
And to explain Effects by ſuch Cauſes is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
Natural Science.</p>
            <p>We have taken notice before of this Author's ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous
uſe of words without declaring in what ſence
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:38607:33"/>
he uſes them. And he is no leſs ambiguous as to his
opinions. When he ſpeaks of the Origin and Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the WORLD, he does not tell us what he
means by that word: whether the great Compound
of the Univerſe, or that ſmall part only where we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.
His <hi>Centrifugal</hi> force he interprets in contrary
ſences, or in contrary words, and reſerves the ſence to
himſelf. Sometimes he ſpeaks of the motion of the
Sun, and ſometimes of the motion of the Earth, and
ſticks to no Syſtem. Neither does he tell us what he
means by the Moſaical Abyſs, or <hi>Tehom Rabbah,</hi> which
the Theoriſt ſuppoſes to have been broken up at the
Deluge. We ought to know in what ſence and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification
he uſes Words or Phraſes: at leaſt if he uſe
them in a different ſence from that of the Theoriſt's.</p>
            <p>I know, <hi>Sir,</hi> you will alſo take notice of his hard
Words and courſe Language, as, <hi>That's falſe, that's
abſurd, that's ridiculous.</hi> This you will ſay, is not uſual
Language amongſt Gentlemen. But we find it too
uſual with ſome Writers, according to their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
temper and experience in the World. For my
part, I think rudeneſs or diſingenuity in examining
the Writings of another Perſon, fall more heavy (in
the conſtruction of fair Readers) upon him that uſes
them, than upon him that ſuffers them. I am,</p>
