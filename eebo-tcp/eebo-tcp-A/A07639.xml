            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>CHAP. 5. A cenſure vpon his fift, ſixt, and ſeuenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning Election, Praedeſtination, and Reprobation.</head>
            <p>IN the argument of his fift Chapter, his words ſtand ſo as if he meant to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Apoſtles doctrine concerning predeſtination. But his text ſheweth, that he meaneth to diſpute againſt Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in chooſing ſome, and reiecting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and to declare, that God ſaw ſome cauſe in man why he did both: holding part with <hi>Arminius,</hi> part with the <hi>Ieſuites</hi>; who make either faith or works foreſeene, or mans freewill to be cauſe of mans ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and ſaluation; and ſay, that man is not rejected, or not choſen, but for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his will and workes. Which is miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked by all ſound Diuines, not becauſe ſuch enter into Gods ſecrets, but becauſe this is diuine doctrine reuealed in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles writings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:14610:2"/>He praetendeth to conſent with the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans.</hi> But <hi>Zanchius</hi> declareth that they are a baſtard brood of <hi>Lutherans</hi> that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne that doctrine, which is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and was lately taught, by <hi>Luther, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi> and other <hi>German</hi> Diuines.</p>
            <p>As the Pagans did attribute the cauſes of their calamities to Chriſtian Religion, ſo ſaith the <hi>Mountebanke</hi> ſome haue attributed the troubles of the Low Countries <hi>falſly,</hi> to the diſſention wrought by the <hi>Arminians.</hi> But this he ſpeaketh out of his ignorance, not knowing the danger wherein the Low Countries ſtood by the practiſes of <hi>Barne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelt,</hi> and other of that ſect. And abſurdly compareth the falſe doctrine of <hi>Arminius</hi> with the Catholicke doctrine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and Chriſtians, that miſlike the haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of <hi>Arminius,</hi> with Pagans blaſpheming our Chriſtian faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bleſſed be the peace-maker among men,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Mountebanke.</hi> But he is not the peace-maker, that troubleth the peaceable ſtate of the Church, with his intempeſtiue do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of <hi>Popery</hi>: nor is it a fit meanes to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:14610:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
make peace, to betray the truth of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the publike enemies thereof. Many fall away to the Pope, but their apoſtacy maketh the diuiſion the greater, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vp no rents, but renteth the vnity of the faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is neuer a Bible-bearing hypocriticall Puritan in the packe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a better Patriot then himſelfe.</hi> As if <hi>Bible-bearing</hi> were a brand of an hypocrite. By which argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either you or your man will proue hypocrites, or <hi>Puritans</hi> when you appeare in the pulpit, which is very ſeldome. What doe, or can, profeſſed <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay more? Such particoloured <hi>iacket-wearers,</hi> albeit they ſeeme to make a faire luſtre in the packe of cards, yet are they nothing but Canarian pedants, praiſing and pleaſing themſelues, and no man elſe. As for <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> and <hi>Barneuelts</hi> followers, they are Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, and haue forſaken the faith, and ſo would he haue once, if mariage, and hope of preferment had not ſtaid him. His heart is with the enemy, and if any occaſion be offred, it is iuſtly to be ſuſpected, his body
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:14610:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
will not bee long from them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>John Caluin</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>came after in time.</hi> So worthy Maſter <hi>John Caluin</hi> that famous Diuine, with this biting Canarian is but plaine <hi>Iohn Caluin</hi>: and he in his lofty conceit will be called Maſter <hi>Mountebanke,</hi> and <hi>Rabbi,</hi> and that is forſooth, becauſe he teacheth Phariſaicall iuſtice, and ſuch like haereſies. But why noteth he as a defect in <hi>Caluin, that he came after Luther</hi>? Doth not he come after <hi>Arminius,</hi> and betrayeth truth, as <hi>Iudas</hi> betrayed <hi>Chriſt?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He profeſſeth, <hi>he will not be more tied to Caluin, then to Luther, or to either of them, more then to Bellarmine</hi>: As if <hi>Bellarmine</hi> were ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually to bee prized with theſe two Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, that were great diſcouerers of the Popes Antichriſtian haereſie and policy. We ſee indeed he ſtandeth rather with <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine,</hi> then with <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Luther,</hi> or <hi>Cauſabon,</hi> if any way they follow his ſquint-eyed poſitions. But in wars and ſtate, if any falſe traitour be found flying to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, the Marſhall, where lawes are exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, ties him vp as a fugitiue, &amp; ſtops his
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:14610:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
flight. Pag. 40. he telleth vs <hi>he was brought vp a member of the Church of England.</hi> But why then did he once determine to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>urch of England? And why doth he now in ſo many points follow ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>Arminius,</hi> then the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of our Church?</p>
            <p>Explaining his aduerſaries doctrine, he ſaith <hi>they hold, that God primarily, abſolutely, and irreſpectiuely, did from all aeternity decree to make ſome veſſels of honour, and ſome of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; to bring them vnto life, or to caſt them off vnto death; to crowne them with glory, or to plunge them into deſtruction and hell fire.</hi> But if he were not aſhamed of his owne abſurd opinion, he would firſt declare what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe holdeth, and then more truly report his aduerſaries doctrine. That God did not reſpect ſomewhat in himſelfe, &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in his ends, we deny not; neither can any doubt that all the elect were praedeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in Chriſt; only we ſay he reſpected not mans freewill, or faith, or workes, in chuſing ſome, and reiecting others. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly; we diſtinguiſh the decree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:14610:4"/>
from the execution, and deny that God did condemne and deſtroy any but for their euill deeds and deſeruings. Albeit, <hi>he loued Iacob, and hated <gap reason="illegible: torn page" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> they had done either good or euill,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle declareth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>Chap. 9. He inſinuateth, that <hi>Caluin taught, that God is Author of ſinne, that God made the moſt part of the world to periſh euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingly, that the reprobate are incited and prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to ſinne by God, that God was the Author of Iuda's treaſon.</hi> Damnable calumniations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that faithfull ſeruant of God, and borrowed from Papiſts, in whoſe ſteps this man doth commonly and willingly tread. I need not refute them, for that the <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanke</hi> durſt not affirme them. But he that will be reſolued of <hi>Caluins</hi> ſincere dealing, let him read the words as he ſetteth them downe in his owne bookes, and conſider the malice of his aduerſaries, diſtorting his words contrary to all ſenſe and true mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Peter</hi> (being elected) <hi>could not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh,</hi> or that <hi>Iudas</hi> (being a reprobate) <hi>could

            <p>Gods abſolute decree in election and reprobation without reſpect to workes in man, the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Mountebanke, doe abhorre.</hi> But <hi>Zanchius de Na<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>We enter not into ſearch of Gods ſecrets,</hi> as he doth charge vs, but only learne what God hath reuealed vnto vs in his word, &amp; what the Apoſtle teacheth all of vs. And this we may doe without danger; but to conteſt with God, and to deny what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle teacheth, as the <hi>Mountebanke</hi> doth, is not only dangerous, but alſo impious.</p>
            <p>That the doctrine of Gods abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree concerning praedeſtination to life, without reſpect to mens works, is <hi>deſperate</hi>;
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14610:6"/>
no man that is pious and learned will af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme: for it is the doctrine of the Apoſtle, of the Church, and moſt learned Diuines: only ſuch deſperate <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> as this deſperate <hi>Mountebanke</hi> declareth himſelfe to be, deſperatly auouch vntruth. But ſhall we heare the profundity of this <hi>Mountebankes</hi> learning concerning praede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination? Liſten then, firſt, he ſaith <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer God willeth, commeth to paſſe.</hi> A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found piece of worke, which euery naturall man vnderſtandeth: and yet this naturall by conſequence denieth, that they are all ſaued, whom God willeth and decreeth ſhall be ſaued. He doth alſo contradict himſelfe, promiſing before that he would not meddle with the execution of Gods purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He pitcheth vpon creation, and ſaith <hi>it goeth neceſſarily before praedeſtination</hi>; a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine moſt falſe &amp; impious. The Apoſtle <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. ſaith, God hath choſen vs in Chriſt, <hi>ante mundi conſtitutionem,</hi> that is, <hi>before the creation.</hi> The Church of England, likevviſe, <hi>Art.</hi> 17. ſpeaking of praedeſtination, ſaith,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:14610:6"/>
               <hi>it is Gods euerlaſting purpoſe before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world were laid.</hi> He ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if he caſt off all piety, yet remember his ſubſcription to the Articles of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, of which he ſo oft talketh.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, he ſaith, that <hi>all being in the maſſe of perdition, God ſtretched out deliuerance in a Mediatour, the man Ieſus Chriſt; and drew ehem out that tooke hold of mercy, leauing them that would none of him.</hi> But firſt, the <hi>Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banke</hi> forgetteth what he hath in hand, that is, Gods aeternall decree before the world, of ſauing the elect: and ſpeaketh of the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the decree, of which formerly he made promiſe to ſay nothing. Next he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mans will to goe before election, and to be the cauſe of our ſaluation; and not Gods election, which is the prime cauſe of it. <hi>The foundation of God remaineth firme, and hath this ſeale</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>God knoweth who are his.</hi> Thirdly, he contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth the Apoſtle <hi>Romans</hi> 9. who maketh Gods will to be the cauſe of our election, and not our will apprehending Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. 4. He ſaith nothing of faith, obedience
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:14610:7"/>
and works foreſeene, which notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, his conſorts make to be cauſes of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is enough,</hi> ſaith <hi>the Appellant, to free God from being the Author of ſinne.</hi> As if God by the Apoſtle were not freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked imputation, albeit he did chuſe men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation of the world, &amp; did elect or reiect according to the purpoſe of his wil, or men did not ſinne willingly: albeit, he did elect ſome and reiect others. Further, if God did draw out ſuch as would lay hold of his mercy, and damned the reſt; yet ſeeing he knew all things before, and decreed hovv all things ſhould be, God by the inference of this <hi>Mountebanke</hi> ſhould be the Authour of ſin and damnation for it. And if this be fate, then is the <hi>Mountebanke</hi> a teacher not only of fate, but alſo of much fatuity; making man to be the cauſe of his ovvne ſaluation, and God the Author of mans damnation, vvhich he vvould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Juſtine Martyr in his Apology, ſpeaketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt fate,</hi> as he ſaith, and ſo doe vve. But
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:14610:7"/>
if election and reprobation inferre fate, as he praetendeth, then is this fatall <hi>Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banke</hi> a teacher of fate, not daring to deny Gods aeternal decree of election and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, according to his owne purpoſe and wil. <hi>Fulgentius ad Monimu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> ſaith, <hi>iuſtice cannot be iuſtice, if God be ſaid not to find men vniuſt, but to make them vniuſt.</hi> As if any of vs held, that God made man vniuſt, or as if this did follow of Gods decree of reprobation. He addeth <hi>that God doth praedeſtinate none to ſin.</hi> But the man hath loſt both ſhame &amp; wit, if he ſay, that <hi>Caluin taught that man is prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated to ſinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Going about to define fate, the <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanke</hi> ſaith it is this; <hi>that they that chuſe the better part, ſhould receiue worthy rewards, and that they that doe euill, ſhould receiue contrary rewards.</hi> But fate is not only in receiuing rewards, but in the diſpoſition of things by a concatenation of ineuitable cauſes. But if it be fate that men ſhould receiue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes according to workes, then is this talker of fate chained with the bonds of fate; teaching; as others doe, rewards to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:14610:8"/>
be giuen according to works. <hi>Tortullian de ſpectac. cap.</hi> 2, denieth that <hi>God created his works to their deſtruction,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>that the cauſe of damnation, is mens peruerſe adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>: which we alſo confeſſe. And yet ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and reprobation is not for workes foreſeene, as the Popiſh <hi>Mountebanke</hi> would haue it. With <hi>Clement</hi> alſo of <hi>Alexandria</hi> we deny, <hi>that God is cauſe of euill</hi>: and reaſon taught heathen men ſo to ſay. And yet if this <hi>Mountebanke</hi> ſhould praeſume to ſay, that God ſet him on to make this blind Appeale, he ſhould vndoubtedly hold, that God is cauſe of euill. <hi>Eccleſiaſtes chap.</hi> 7. ſaith, <hi>God made man right,</hi> but <hi>he buſied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with many quaſtions,</hi> as this <hi>Mountebanke</hi> doth. <hi>Nazianzen orat.</hi> 42. ſaith, we were made to be well and happy: and <hi>Baſil</hi> in a certaine Homily proueth, <hi>that God is not the Author of euill</hi>: As if it were euill, that God chuſeth ſome, and not others. Againſt vs he praeuaileth no more then if he ſhould caſt feathers againſt the winde. For man originally was made right and to liue well and happily: But falling wilfully from
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:14610:8"/>
God, he incurred Gods wrath. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2 ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>if any man cleanſe himſelfe, hee ſhall bee made a veſſell of honour</hi>: but if the <hi>Mountebanke</hi> ſay he can clenſe himſelfe, and hath it in his power to be made a veſſell of honour, he ſhall diſhonour his <hi>Mountebank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> turning plaine Pelagian. Of any thing that we ſay it followeth not, that man is of neceſſity forced to be euill, as <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith, for he ſinneth willingly. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, <hi>Iudas</hi> ranne wilfully into his treaſon: ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes blind and ignorant men run wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully into Popery and other haereſies. To conclude, <hi>Proſper de vocat. Gent. cap.</hi> 2. ſaith <hi>God damneth no man vniuſtly.</hi> But what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all this long ſpeaking againſt <hi>Caluin</hi>? Doth he ſay, or can the <hi>Mountebanke</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude out of his words, that God damneth any man vniuſtly, or is cauſe of euill?</p>
            <p>Thus he wreſtleth againſt <hi>Caluin</hi> in vaine: But his owne wicked doctrine is quickly ouerthrowne without any great wreſtling. For if election and reprobation of men be made for the good vſe of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, or workes foreſeene, vvhy doth the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:14610:9"/>
Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. ſay, that God did before they had done any workes loue <hi>Iacob</hi> and hate <hi>Eſau?</hi> And vvhy did he deny he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them for their vvorkes? Why doth he aſſigne no cauſe of election, but Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe? In the ſame place he ſaith, <hi>God will haue mercy, on whom he will haue mercy</hi>: and <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. that God made choice of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren before the foundation of the vvorld. Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> goeth a little further <hi>lib.</hi> 15. <hi>de ciuit. Dei c.</hi> 1. vvhen diuiding all mankind into tvvo ſocieties, he ſaith, The one is <hi>praedeſtinated to reigne eternally with God, the other to ſuſtaine eternall puniſhment with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.</hi> And <hi>epiſt.</hi> 105. <hi>ad Sixt. God made ſome veſſels of wrath to deſtruction, that hee might therein ſhew his power.</hi> This is alſo the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Peter Lombard ſent. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>diſt.</hi> 41. <hi>a.</hi> of <hi>Thomas</hi> 1. <hi>q.</hi> 23 <hi>art.</hi> 2. and many Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>Neither is this <hi>a forraine doctrine,</hi> as is his <hi>Foppery, Popery,</hi> and <hi>Arminianiſme</hi>: but the true tenet of the domeſticals of faith yea, of the Church of England, from vvhich this runnegate doth vvilfully diſſent.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:14610:9"/>
               <hi>Art.</hi> 17. The Church ſaith, <hi>predestination is Gods euerlasting decree before the foundation of the world was laid</hi>: The <hi>Mountebanke</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth praedeſtination to follovv the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The Church maintaineth <hi>that we are iuſtified freely</hi>: This Factor for Antichriſt teacheth iuſtification by ſomewhat inhae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in vs. The Church alloweth the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of praedeſtination <hi>to be ſweet, pleaſant, and comfortable:</hi> Deſperate <hi>Dicke</hi> holdeth it to be a deſperate doctrine.</p>
            <p>He refuſeth to be <hi>tied to the concluſions at Dort</hi>: So doth alſo Maſter <hi>Alder</hi> and other <hi>Papiſts.</hi> But what hath he to obiect againſt the concluſions of that reuerend Synode, wherein his Dioceſan, and diuers learned Diuines of England did ſit as iudges? Is not ſuch a blinking bayard aſhamed to controle ſuch authority? And if he can ſay ſomewhat againſt it, he will proue a profounder <hi>Arminian,</hi> then his fellowes. He praetendeth to <hi>follow the determinations of the Synode at London</hi>: yet I haue proued that he directly oppoſeth them. Further, like as <hi>Iudas</hi> betraying <hi>Chriſt,</hi> kiſſed him, ſo
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:14610:10"/>
this treacherous runnegate praetending to praiſe our Engliſh Diuines, that were actors in the Synode of Dort, doth ſecretly buffet them, as confirming deſperate do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and falſe concluſions.</p>
            <p>Rayling againſt our brethren in the Low Countries, he ſaith, <hi>our Churches diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline in the Synode of Dort, and other Dutch Synodes is held vnlawfull</hi>: a ſhameles vntruth. For in the Synode of Dort, nothing was mentioned, that condemned our diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and other Synodes eſtabliſhed their owne orders, and ſpoke nothing of ours. But to him all are <hi>Puritans</hi> and enemies, that are not of his Popiſh cut. This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that neither our Church, nor any Orthodox congregation doth hold, that the reprobate and <hi>veſſels of diſhonour, may be purged &amp; made veſſels of honor,</hi> as he doth <hi>p.</hi> 67. This is to rake hell, and make Gods hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly decrees mutable.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Deodatus</hi> a miniſter of <hi>Geneua</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented from the concluſions at <hi>Dort,</hi> as he affirmeth, is not probable For why then did he ſubſcribe to them? That the Church
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:14610:10"/>
of <hi>Geneua</hi> ſhould diſſent from <hi>Caluin</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> her teachers, I ſhall then beleeue when the <hi>Mountebanke</hi> ſhall ſhew wherein. Let the <hi>Mountebanke</hi> ſhew, if he can, that the learned in Schooles, or the Church in Synods maintained his <hi>Arminianiſme</hi>; or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, or ſharpely reproued the Articles e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed in a Synode at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> as he boldly, blindly, and impudently affirmeth, or elſe he hath for euer loſt his credit. And as for Doctor <hi>Whitaker</hi> of pious memory, he was a man of that ſincerity and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that none of his <hi>Arminian</hi> conſorts, if he were aliue, durſt encounter him in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation or otherwiſe. As for this <hi>Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banke</hi> he dares not declare all his opinions, but ſpuing forth his poiſon here and there by fragments, hideth himſelfe in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of his other diſcourſes. Returning backe to talke of iuſtification, he ſaith, a iuſtified man may become like <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Judas.</hi> But the Church of England teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not ſo, nor doth it hold that <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> were truly iuſtified: nor if he were once iuſtified, ſhould he be ſo like <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Judas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:14610:11"/>He inueigheth againſt our brethren of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> as not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to vs in their diſcipline: Bu<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> his hatred is more to their doctrine of faith, then of diſcipline. This is only to make a diuiſion, and to ſtirre vp mens hatred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, that in the end they and we may haue our throats cut for our doctrine of faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of ſauing by abſolute neceſsity, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of repentance,</hi> he talketh idlely.

And albeit he conferreth grace vpon men, yet he doth not grace them, but he changeth their will, and maketh them conformable to his lawes. But this is not the cauſe, either of mans election, or iuſtification; but the effect rather. Of the deſtruction of the reprobate, he diſputeth contrary to the doctrine of Saint <hi>Auſtine lib.</hi> 15 <hi>de civit.
