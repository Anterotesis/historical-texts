                  <note>A Lover of the Truth = Carew Raleigh. Sometimes also attributed to Peter Heylyn.</note>
                  <note>Carew Raleigh was the only surviving son of Sir Walter Raleigh. This work is in reply to "A compleat history of the lives and reigns of Mary Queen of Scotland, and of her son and successor, James the Sixth, King of Scotland; and (after Queen Elizabeth) King of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, the First, (of ever blessed memory.)" by Sir William Sanderson (Wing S647). In his observations, Carew Raleigh notes that his father had loaned "great sums of money" to Sanderson's father. On his release from the Tower the elder Raleigh requested repayment and was forced to file suit against the elder Sanderson. Sanderson was "found in arrears to Sir Walter Raleigh in very great sums, was cast into prison, and there dyed a poor contemptible beggar".</note>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is one Mr. <hi>Sanderſon,</hi> who hath lately written a booke which he calls a Compleat Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>James</hi> (her ſon) the ſixth of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and firſt of <hi>England:</hi> In which, he hath compiled, not a Hiſtory, but a Libel againſt all the good men and good actions of thoſe times, and with moſt ſervile flattery, praiſed and exalted the bad, both men and matters. His whole book is a rapſody of notes and ſcattered papers, from other men, collected without either order or method; being exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly defective both in time, place and nominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and written in ſo unſeemly and disjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a ſtile, that you may eaſily perceive he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up other mens words, without underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their matter; and unleſſe it be where he rails on perſons of honour (which he doth plainly, and often, though ſometimes very falſly) his language is dark, harſh, and unintelligible. But
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:152698:3"/>
that you may the better know what ware you are like to have out of this mans ſhop, I ſhall give you his character, and trace him from his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. His father was a Gentleman, though poor, (but that I take to be no ſin, though this man doth, and how he can clear himſelf from that offence, I know not) he was of kin to Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> and in the time of his proſperitie and greatneſſe was his ſervant, and intruſted with receiving great ſums of money for him, out of his Office of Wines, and other his places, by which he became in arrears to Sr. <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers great ſums: which after his troubles (being a priſoner in the Tower) Sr. <hi>Walter</hi> ſent unto <hi>Sanderſon</hi> for; But he was ſo far from paying them (preſuming that <hi>Raleigh</hi> was there friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe) that he pretended Sr. <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> ſhould owe him 2000 <hi>li.</hi> Whereupon Sir <hi>Walter</hi> in great anger, commenced a ſuit againſt <hi>Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> which was managed by his ſervant and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitor, <hi>John Shelbury;</hi> And <hi>Sanderſon</hi> being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown and found in arrears to Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> in very great ſums, was caſt into priſon, and there dyed a poor contemptible beggar. And hence originally ſprang all the ſpleen and malice of this man to Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh.</hi> For this man himſelf, he lived, for ought I could ever hear, at firſt very obſcurely, and (as I conjecture by ſome paſſages
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:152698:3"/>
in his book) ſtudied Hiraldry, for he often brings in many impertinent digreſſions to ſhew his skill that way. But afterwards, he tells us he was ſervant to the Lord <hi>Roſs,</hi> in his Spaniſh Embaſſie; a fit ſervant, no doubt, for ſuch a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter: For what that Lord was, I ſhall not need to mention, it being ſo notoriouſly known to moſt men yet living. After this he tells us, he was at the ſiege of <hi>Breda,</hi> under the Earl of <hi>Oxford;</hi> to whom in his book he was pleaſed to give the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of a deboyſt Lord; with many other unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Epithites. But I cannot learn that this man had ever any relation to the Court (more then at large) until he became Secretary to the Earl of <hi>Holland,</hi> when he was Chancellor of <hi>Cambridg,</hi> where he behaved himſelf ſo corruptly, that he was with great diſgrace and ſcorn, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of his place, for taking Bribes of divers Scholars to make them Doctors, and Batchelors of Divinity, when the King came to an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment at <hi>Cambridg:</hi> So that for a long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, theſe men were by every boy called, <hi>Sanderſons</hi> Doctors. A pretty while after this, he married the late Queens Landreſſe, and ſo might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance creep again into her chamber below ſtairs; but for any other imployment in Court, after his Secretary-ſhip, I could never hear he had any: And now you may gueſſe what liquor you are like
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:152698:4"/>
to draw out of a veſſel thus ſeaſoned.</p>
            <p>I ſhall proceed to examine ſome particulars in his book, wherein I ſhall abſolutely decline ſaying any thing concerning the Queen of Scots, or that part of the Story, both the errors, and excellencies of that Lady, and the inevitable cauſes of her deplorable deſtinie, being ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently known to all. Only I ſhall obſerve, that in ſome paſſages of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Raigne, he gives a harſher cenſure upon <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and his offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then any writer heretofore. As likewiſe in <hi>fol.</hi> 128. he ſeemes to intimate out of ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between <hi>Daviſon</hi> the Secretary, and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> That ſhe would have had the Queen of Scots poyſoned, by <hi>Paulet</hi> and <hi>Drury</hi> her keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; which they refuſed. But is it likely Kings ſhould want fit miniſters for ſuch miſchiefs, when common men can hire them daily? I think not; and if they refuſed, others might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have bin had; But this is a ſcandal raiſed upon that excellent Princeſſe, which I never heard, or read of before. There is no Innocence ſo clear, which this mans pen will not ſlubber: For what need ſhe have gon ſo fouly to work to take away her life, whom the whole Parliament of <hi>Eng.</hi> petitioned her to execute? which this Author confeſeth, <hi>fol.</hi> 117. and I hope it is no ſecret, that her death proceeded even fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Scots themſelves;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:152698:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
yea even from thoſe whom K. <hi>James</hi> ſent to ſolicit for her: Witneſs that ſpeech of the Maſter of <hi>Gray, tua non mordet.</hi> As for her Son, King <hi>James,</hi> truly I believe none will deny him to be a Learned Prince, and of great experience, which the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and vexations he had endured in his youth, by his own undutiful and head-ſtrong Scots ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, had well taught him. But it cannot be denyed, that he failed even in that which he moſt boaſted of, his King craft; for he never treated with any Prince, or State in Chriſtendome, that he was not over-reached; he ſpent more in frivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Embaſſies, then would have raiſed an army to have ſetled his Children in their inheritance: and being wooed, and courted to have been head of all the Proteſtant Princes in Chriſtendome, (which would have impowred him to give the Law to all this part of the world) he refuſed; and inclined to their enemies, whereby (as much as in him lay) he ruined the one, and advanced the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>And whereas his acceſſion to this Kingdome hath been thought by ſome the greateſt happineſſe that ever befel the Nations, it hath proved (by what ſecret predetermination of the allſeeing God no man knoweth) the greateſt miſfortune to both. For after a miſerable and waſting civil war, we ſee his poſterity (deſerving Princes in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:152698:5"/>
their own perſons) overthrown, and caſt out of their inheritance, and (according to humane reaſon) very unlikely to repoſſeſſe it.</p>
            <p>And for his own haereditary Kingdome (who were a people famous in war, and high in repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,) they are become the moſt deſpicable conquered people, upon the face of the whole earth. They who within this twenty yeares looked upon themſelves as conquerors of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they who in the laſt two Kings Raignes had all the power, riches, offices, mariages, wealth and greatneſſe, within their command in both Kingdomes, are now ruined at home, both in Kirke and State. The former (unto which by faire or foul play, they endeavoured to model all the Reformed Churches of the Weſt) hath now, no where a being: And the latter ſubjugated to a forreign power. All their great and Ancient Families (of which they ſo much boaſted) even plucked up by the roots, and thoſe few remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo poor, as they can not ſhew their faces. <hi>This is the Lords doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes;</hi> but according to humane judgment, much of this may be attributed to the greatneſſe, power, and prodigality of that nation, in their acceſſe to <hi>England,</hi> (whereby they became inſolent and proud, apted thereby for any undertaking; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance, for ſome falſhoods and treacheries, even
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:152698:5"/>
to their own native Princes;) to King <hi>James</hi> his dying in diſtaſt with the Parliament; to his often deſerting the Proteſtant cauſe, both at home and abroad: And to his leaving the Crown poor, and in debt, whereby his Succeſſor was often put to his ſhifts, and forced to open the purſ-ſtrings of his Subjects, whereby he ſhut their hearts towards him, and encouraged them to demand ſuch things, as nothing but extreme poverty and neceſſity, could enforce a Prince to grant.</p>
            <p>But enough of this, I ſhal only novv take notice of ſuch aſperſions as this Author is pleaſed to beſtow on particular perſons of honour and worth, as if he meant throughout his whole book, to make it his buſineſſe to raile at good men, and defend the bad.</p>
            <p>And firſt we light upon <hi>Cobham,</hi> and <hi>Raleighs</hi> Treaſon: where in the character of <hi>Raleigh,</hi> he allows him <hi>a grand enemy to the Spaniard, and oppoſer of the peace;</hi> yet immediately after, believes him a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirer with the <hi>Spaniard;</hi> but tells us not in what particular he ſhould have ſerved him. <hi>Fol.</hi> 284. <hi>he tells us that the ſeventh of</hi> Novemb. 1603 <hi>was the day of</hi> Raleighs <hi>arraignment, and the Jury called to the Bar, being a</hi> Middleſex <hi>Jury, againſt whoſe perſons he did not except.</hi> Tis true, he did not, for he knew not any one of their faces; and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:152698:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of his own innocence, onely wiſhed they might have honeſty, and underſtanding; both which they wanted. But there was appointed for him another Jury, the foreman of which was Sir <hi>Michal Stanhope,</hi> the next, Sir <hi>Edward Darcy,</hi> the next, Sir <hi>William Killegrew,</hi> all men of honour, and near ſervants to the late Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> But theſe being found not for their turn, they were all changed over night, and thoſe others put in their places. The arraignment is in Print, therefore I ſhall not trouble my ſelf with the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of it. I ſhall only demand why <hi>Cobham</hi> was not brought face to face to accuſe <hi>Raleigh,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the ſame roof with him, in ſo much, that King <hi>James</hi> himſelf taking notice of it, ſaid, that if <hi>Cobham</hi> could have ſaid any thing againſt <hi>Raleigh,</hi> they would have brought him from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> to have accuſed him. And I would fain know, what it was that ever <hi>Cobham</hi> accuſed <hi>Raleigh</hi> of; for yet I never could. Likewiſe, whether ever any man was condemned by a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle witneſſe, and he not preſent neither. And it is certain, that letter of <hi>Cobhams</hi> under his own hand written the night before his tryal, wherein upon his ſalvation he clears <hi>Raleigh</hi> from all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Treaſons, againſt the King or State, is yet extant, and was produced at a Committee of Parliament, by Mr. <hi>Carew Raleigh.</hi> But you may
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:152698:6"/>
perceive the ſpleen of this Author to <hi>Raleigh,</hi> in that he ſaith, <hi>he tired the Court and Jury with imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencies,</hi> when as all other men preſent at his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment, thought never man ſpake better for himſelf; nay divers which came thither his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, went away with pity, and commiſerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his injuries and misfortunes; and even <hi>Cook</hi> the Attorney himſelf, being retired into a garden to take ſome ayre, when his man brought him word that the Jury had condemned <hi>Raleigh</hi> of Treaſon, anſwered, ſurely thou art miſtaken; for I my ſelf accuſed him but of miſpriſion of Treaſon; and this relation upon the word of a Chriſtian, I have received from Sir <hi>Edward Cook's</hi> own mouth.</p>
            <p>And ſince we are now fallen upon this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, we will take it all together, and ſee what he ſaith concerning <hi>Raleighs</hi> laſt voyage, and death, though it happened 14 years after. <hi>Fol.</hi> 459 and <hi>Anno.</hi> 1617 <hi>he tells us, that Sir</hi> Walter Raleigh, <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with long impriſonment, and having there ſpent his time well in the Hiſtory of the World, made his petition more paſſable to the K. whoſe love to learning, granted him now at laſt his liberty, and not long after gave him leave to wander after a deſign, to the Weſtern world, where be had been in ſeveral Climats before.</hi> Whereas it is well known, King <hi>James</hi> forbad Sir <hi>Walter Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leighs</hi> book, for ſome paſſages in it which offended
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:152698:7"/>
the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and for being two plain with the faults of Princes in his Preface. Sir <hi>William</hi> St. <hi>Johns,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Villiers,</hi> the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inghams</hi> half-Brother, procured Sir <hi>Walter Raleighs</hi> liberty, and had 1500 <hi>li.</hi> for their labour, and for 700 <hi>li.</hi> more, offered him his full pardon, and liberty not to go his Voyage, if he pleaſed; both which he refuſed; and the rather, becauſe he was told by the Lord Chancellor <hi>Verulam</hi> (who was no fool, nor no ill Lawyer) That his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the King under the great ſeal of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (wherein the King made him General of his forces by Land and Sea, and gave him Marſhal law over his people) was as good a pardon for all former offences, as the law of <hi>England</hi> could afford him.</p>
            <p>And for the aſperſions which he lays upon his Voyage; <hi>as that it was a trick only to get his liberty, and that he knew of no Mine;</hi> If ſo, <hi>Raleigh</hi> was a mad man to hazard his life in ſuch a long Sea journey, and to expend above 10000 <hi>li.</hi> of his own eſtate (as tis well known upon oath he did) vvhen he might have avoyded that trouble and ſtayd at home for the disburſing 700 <hi>li.</hi> But it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that <hi>Raleigh</hi> did really and truly believe in the mine, and ſo did <hi>Kemiſh</hi> too, upon good and juſt grounds, having had a true trial of the ore, and not with falſe and Chymical tricks, as this
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:152698:7"/>
trifling lyar would intimate.</p>
            <p>But for the particulars of theſe paſſages, and the true cauſe of the fayling of that Voyage, I ſhall refer you to Sir <hi>Walter Raleighs</hi> own Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, now in print, and to be had every where; upon the verity of which he took his death. And for this Authors baſe aſperſion, and ſurmiſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the death of <hi>Kemiſh,</hi> it was ſo well known to all thoſe who were in the ſhip, how, and in what manner he killed himſelf, (firſt ſhooting himſelf with a Piſtol, and then ſtabbing himſelf with a knife, to diſpatch, leſt he ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented upon the noyſe of the Piſtol, his Cabbin door being locked on the in ſide,) that there can be nothing more plain and evident, then that he killed himſelf: But this unworthy Author will ſeek ſcandals from every thing. So he ſaith, <hi>he ſet out this Voyage with other mens money;</hi> when it is well known (though he had many adventures) that he received 8000 <hi>li.</hi> from the Counteſſe of <hi>Bedford</hi> in ready money, which he had lent her; that he ſold a houſe and land at <hi>Micham</hi> in <hi>Surry,</hi> for 2500 <hi>li.</hi> all which money, and more, he ſpent every farthing in this Voyage; for ten ſhips (and he had no leſſe) with their men, ammunition, and victuals, would not be ſet out with the adventures of a few fifty, and hundred pounds alone.</p>
            <p>This Author likewiſe ſaith; <hi>That Raleigh had</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:152698:8"/>
               <hi>but a mean fortune, which he meant to advantage by this Voyage.</hi> He may thank K. <hi>James</hi> for the meanneſſe of his fortune, who took away <hi>Sherborne</hi> from him for want of a word, after he had been 7 years in the Tovver, and gave it to his favourite, <hi>Summerſet;</hi> But vvhen K. <hi>James</hi> came into <hi>England, Raleigh</hi> vvas Lord Warden of the <hi>Stanneries,</hi> Lord Leivetenant of <hi>Devonſhire</hi> and <hi>Cornwall,</hi> Captain of the Guard, and Governor of <hi>Jerſey;</hi> he had a long leaſe of the Office of Wines; he had moſt of the Earl of <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> eſtate in <hi>Ireland;</hi> he had the daughter and heyre of <hi>Baſſet</hi> to his vvard, to marry to his ſon; her eſtate vvorth 3000 <hi>li. per. an.</hi> vvho vvas taken from him, and married to Mr. <hi>Henry Haward,</hi> vvho dyed ſuddainly at the table; and ſhe after married to the Earl of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> vvho profeſſed he vvould never have married her, if young <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> had been alive; conceiving her before God to be his vvife, for they vvere married as much as children could be; he had likevviſe <hi>Sherborn,</hi> vvhich vvas lately valued by the State at 5000 <hi>li. per-an.</hi> and this vvas no beggerly eſtate, all vvhich he loſt for his ſuppoſed treaſon: And it is certain that many years after, he and <hi>Cobham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing priſoners, upon the ſute of <hi>Q. Ann</hi> (being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto preſſed by Sr. <hi>W. R.) Cobham</hi> vvas re-exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned before ſome of the Lords of the Councel at the Tovver, and did clear Sir <hi>W. R.</hi> from all treaſons vvhatſoever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:152698:8"/>
Tis likewiſe true, that the whole deſign and intention of his Voyage, was by K. <hi>James</hi> (under <hi>Raleighs</hi> own hand) delivered to <hi>Gondomare,</hi> and thereupon there was 300 <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſent to St. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae,</hi> which made that reſiſtance there that was: and <hi>Raleigh</hi> found his own letter, under his own hand, in the Governor of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> Cloſet, which letter he brought back, and ſhewed it to the Lords of the Counſel.</p>
            <p>Now whereas he ſaith, <hi>They had matter enough to take away his life in this his laſt buſineſſe,</hi> why did the Lords of the Councel then, for a whole year together examine him at the Tower every week, to pick out what they could to condemn him? and yet, when all was done, they were fain to tell the King, that if he would take away his life, he muſt take advantage of his former condemnation, which was accordingly done.</p>
            <p>The next ſcandalous paſſage we meet with, is <hi>fol.</hi> 365. concerning <hi>Will.</hi> Earl of <hi>Pembrook,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> Earl of <hi>Montgomerie</hi> his brother, <hi>who he ſaith were men of conſiderable deſcents, though of no fame in their merits;</hi> when all men know <hi>William Pembrook</hi> was a man of Honour, Valour, and Learning; and as well beloved as any man in this Nation. But he leaves not the other brother ſo, but farther ſaith, <hi>though the King was no quarreller, yet he hated a coward.</hi> (Strange! that the King ſhould hate that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:152698:9"/>
in his favourite, which was ſo predominant in himſelf) <hi>and turned</hi> Montgomery <hi>out of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, for being ſwitcht by a mean Gentleman</hi> (Ramſey) <hi>a Scot, at a publick horſe-race. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ough this favourite was urged to revenge, and backed by the</hi> Engliſh, <hi>forty to one, to defend him: he baſely put it up to his death, and the diſhonor of a Gentleman.</hi> That this paſſage in the main parts of it is true, cannot be denyed; but aggravated with theſe circumſtances, moſt ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous and baſe, and in every part of it moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to be left to poſterity in Print, being a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and malicious blot upon a noble family, and no way fit to be recorded by a Chronicler: &amp; it is moſt notoriouſly falſe that the King deſerted <hi>Montgomery</hi> for this action; for though he were then in fancy with <hi>Carr,</hi> yet after this he gave <hi>Montgomery</hi> greater gifts, and was kinder to him then ever he had been before in all his life; and the rather, for putting up this injury, leſt it ſhould have bred a national quarrel (which it had like to have done) and which King <hi>James</hi> dreaded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things in the world; for it is certain there was a ſword put into <hi>Montgomeries</hi> hand (being in an hunting poſture without weapon) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himſelf; and he ſought for <hi>Ramſey</hi> all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the field, but he was conveyed out of the way by the Scots; and Mr. <hi>Pinchback</hi> by name, ſaid to <hi>Montgomery,</hi> My Lord, let us break our faſt with
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:152698:9"/>
them here (meaning the Scots) and ſup with them at <hi>London.</hi> For which ſpeech King <hi>James</hi> ever hated <hi>Pinchback</hi> to his dying day. <hi>Ramſey</hi> was committed cloſe priſoner to the Tower, and there lay until he had made all poſſible ſubmiſſions that could be invented; and it is well known that King <hi>James</hi> was alwayes kind to <hi>Montgomery</hi> to the very laſt, as this Author himſelf confeſſeth in another place of his book, <hi>fol.</hi> 592 therefore a falſe and malicious ſuggeſtion, meerly brought in to brand <hi>Montgomery</hi> with a laſting diſgrace.</p>
            <p>The next buſineſſe we ſhall take notice of, is, the poyſoning of <hi>Overbury,</hi> wherein he ſtrives all he can to extenuate that foul murther, both in <hi>Summerſet</hi> and his Wife; and magnifying the juſtice which was done therein, forgets that <hi>Summerſet</hi> and his Wife, who were principals, and drew in all the reſt (for money and rewards) were pardoned, and only the poor acceſſaries hanged. And what an unworthy character doth he give of that poor unfortunate Gentleman <hi>Overbury,</hi> ſaying, <hi>That he was of an impudent and Thraſonical diſpoſition, that he had little in him that was ſolid, for religion or moral ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and that he was naught, and corrupt, making him the baud to</hi> Summerſets <hi>luſt with</hi> Eſſex <hi>his Wife; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him brag of that imployment?</hi> when as all men that ever I met with, have ever held <hi>Overbury</hi> to have been a ſober, religious, and learned Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:152698:10"/>
and ſo it appeareth by what hath come out in publick of his writing; beſides, he doth in this diſparage <hi>Summerſet,</hi> whom he would defend, by making him chuſe ſo weak, and vitious a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for his moſt intimate friend, and indeed his governor. Haply <hi>Overbury</hi> might have ſome tincture of pride in him, (as indeed who would not, that had the power and intereſt of ſuch a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite at his command; that commanded the King himſelf, and often was known to threaten him if he denyed what he deſired?) But that he ſhould be his baud to <hi>Eſſex</hi> his Wife, is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, when all the world knows he was her greateſt enemy, and that his hatred to her, and the Houſe of the <hi>Hawards</hi> was his ruine. How doth this paſſage agree with that which follows after, wherein this Author ſayes <hi>(in the relation of this Ladies Divorce from</hi> Eſſex) <hi>that ſhe was a pure Virgin, and ſo delivered in upon oath from the inſpection of divers Ladies?</hi> But this Author often forgets and contradicts himſelf: Haply <hi>Overbury</hi> had hindred, or thwarted this Gentleman in ſome il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal projects (of which they ſay, he had alwayes ſtore) which he had offered to <hi>Summerſet,</hi> and therefore he is not only contented his body ſhould have been poyſoned whilſt alive, but he will (as far as in him lyes, if any would believe ſuch a fellow) murther his fame too, after his death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:152698:10"/>
I ſhall next only mind you of a letter which he ſets down <hi>fol.</hi> 421 of <hi>Summerſets</hi> to the King, wherein there is this paſſage, ſpeaking concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his eſtate, which he deſired the King to ſpare. <hi>And I may ſay further, that the Law hath not bin ſo ſevere upon the ruine of innocent poſterity, nor yet cancelled nor cut off the merits of Anceſtors, before the politick hand of State had contrived it into theſe ſeveral forms, as fitted to their ends and government.</hi> And yet this man <hi>(Summerſet)</hi> could begg all the lands of <hi>Raleigh,</hi> could begg the 10000 <hi>li.</hi> fine of the Earl of <hi>Northumberlands,</hi> and could enjoy the greateſt part of the forfeited Lands of the Earl of <hi>Weſtmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> without any ſcruple. But we are alwayes blind in our own affaires.</p>
            <p>And in <hi>fol.</hi> 429 I take notice of another ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal which he throws upon his <hi>quondam</hi> Maſter, <hi>Henry Ritch, Baron Kenſington,</hi> and Earl of <hi>Holland, ſcoffing at him for imitating the Earl of</hi> Carlile, <hi>in his expenſive wayes, and calling him the natural ſon of the then Earl of</hi> Warwick; which why he ſhould do, I can not imagin, for certainly, the Lady <hi>Ritch</hi> was the then lawful wife of the Lord <hi>Ritch,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and if any of her children were to be ſtiled natural, it were thoſe which ſhe had by the Earl of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> not theſe by <hi>Ritch:</hi> For as this Author ſaith in another place, King <hi>James</hi> told <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> that he had gotten a faire
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:152698:11"/>
Wife, with a foul ſoul; But no doubt this Author had a pick at <hi>Holland,</hi> for turning him out of his ſervice, as is mentioned before.</p>
            <p>I omit his ſlight character of <hi>Abbot</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> ſcoffing at his judgment in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of <hi>Eſſex</hi> his Divorce, calling him Puritan, and a fomentor of factions: His deſpiſing our Nation in the expedition of the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with the fag end of an old Ballad; <hi>ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they went abroad to fight, and ſo came home againe; as if they had only danced a morice thither;</hi> when it is well known, they defended <hi>Manheinu,</hi> and <hi>Frankendale</hi> nobly, and <hi>Hydelburge</hi> with ſo much honour, that Sir <hi>Gerard Herbert</hi> (Commander in chiefe there) loſt his life at puſh of Pike.</p>
            <p>How contemptuouſly doth he ſpeak of the Earls, <hi>Oxford,</hi> and <hi>Eſſex,</hi> terming them <hi>young men, apprehending no danger, and ſo ignorant, they knew not how to avoid any?</hi> How improbably doth he caſt the compiling of the Hiſtory of the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> upon a Proteſtant, thereby to vilifie the work, as partial? <hi>fol.</hi> 471 And how doth he throughout his whole book, contemne and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie, both the Reformers, and Reformation of Religion?</p>
            <p>I ſhall now only give you an Item, of ſome few of his miſtakes. He tells us that King <hi>Hen.</hi> 8 was a Lutheran, when all Story aſſures us, he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:152698:11"/>
and dyed a Papiſt. Tis true, he put down Monaſteries for his own profit, and he declyned the Popes Supremacy for his own pleaſure; and for defending of theſe, he put Sir <hi>Thomas Moor,</hi> and Biſhop <hi>Fiſher</hi> to death, with many others: But at the ſame time, he put multitudes to death, for not ſubſcribing and ſubmitting to the ſix Articles, which were all of them ranke Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery.</p>
            <p>He tells us, <hi>fol.</hi> 487 <hi>that all our marriages with</hi> Spain <hi>have been unfortunate to this Crown;</hi> and then ravels into the ſtory of the <hi>Black Prince,</hi> as if he had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in <hi>Spain;</hi> but if he will read our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles, he ſhall find, to ſpeake the truth, (though I love not the nation) that the Spaniſh wives were good; and that it was the French wives which proved ſo unfortunate to our Kings. Such was <hi>Elenor,</hi> Wife to <hi>Hen.</hi> 2, who ſet all his Sons toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the eares with him. Such was <hi>Iſabel,</hi> Wife to <hi>Ed.</hi> 2, who for the love of <hi>Mortimer,</hi> ſuffered her husband to be miſerably, and cruelly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered. And ſuch was <hi>Margaret,</hi> Wife to <hi>Hen.</hi> 6, who by her pride, perverſneſſe, and evil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was one of the chief cauſes in the ruine of that meek and gentle Prince; vvhom ſhe lived to ſee murthered in the Tovver, and her onely Son, the Prince, ſtabbed to death at <hi>Tewxbury</hi> field, and her ſelf ſent home poor and miſerable, to her
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:152698:12"/>
more poor and beggarly Father, in <hi>Provence:</hi> I need name no more.</p>
            <p>Another miſtake he hath concerning the Duke of <hi>Buckinghams</hi> talking with <hi>Yelverton</hi> in the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; which ſurely the Duke never did: But that Sir <hi>William Balfore</hi> ſhould tell him ſo, as being then Lieutenant of the Tower, can not be, for <hi>Balfore</hi> came in to be Lieutenant, after Sir <hi>George More,</hi> which was long after this time.</p>
            <p>Another ſuch miſtake he hath in point of time, relating the publick combat, which ſhould have bin between the Lord <hi>Rey,</hi> and <hi>David Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey,</hi> which he ſaith, <hi>was in the time of King</hi> James; when in truth, it was in the Reign of King <hi>Charles,</hi> and after the Marquis <hi>Hamiltons</hi> expedition into <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Speaking of the troubles of the Earl of <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex, he tells us, that to his knowledg the Duke bought</hi> Chelſey <hi>houſe;</hi> for the truth of this, I refer my ſelf to the Widow Counteſſe of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> now living, who hath told me many times, that the Duke had <hi>Chelſey</hi> for nothing, and that her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band never received one peny for it.</p>
            <p>In another ſtory, he inverts the ſame juſt upon <hi>Middleſex;</hi> ſaying, <hi>that he bought</hi> Copthall <hi>of the Counteſſe of Winchelſey,</hi> when I my ſelf know very well, that the Lady gave <hi>Copthall,</hi> furniture and all, to <hi>Middleſex</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> to be made
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:152698:12"/>
Counteſſe; and <hi>Middleſex</hi> indeed bought out the Dukes eſtate; but his miſtakes, ignorances, and wilful errors, are infinite, both in the language, and the matter. I ſhall therefore conclude with that wholſome advice, which once that Grave and Learned Lord Chancellor <hi>Elſemore,</hi> gave to Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond Scony,</hi> preſenting him with a book, in hope he would have given him ſomething, (being then very poor, his father yet alive) which book, the Chancellor having read over, ſaith to Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond:</hi> Sir <hi>Edmond Scony,</hi> you gave me a book, for which I will give you [I humbly thank your Lordſhip, cryes Sir <hi>Edmond]</hi> I will give you good counſel; Read more, and write leſſe, Sir <hi>Edmond;</hi> for indeed it is a very fooliſh book: So ſay I, Read more, and write leſſe, Mr. <hi>Sanderſon;</hi> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is not only a very fooliſh, but a very falſe, and ſcandalous book, far fitter for the fire, then for the Preſſe.</p>
