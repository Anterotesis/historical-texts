            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OF this most Honorable Convocation, my bounden duty commandeth me to bee a Speaker, which as yet have alwayes bin silent, and which is not concerning any meane matter, or the affayres of so little conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, but that it concernes both Kingdomes, and my owne particular affront at my first comming to this Assembly.</p>
            <p>But first, I begin in my Kings behalfe, who hath beene present here so long, that others bemoane to my knowledge, his absence.</p>
            <p>You cannot but thinke my Lords, that <hi>England</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:96384:3"/>
will be contented without their Soveraigne, for a body without a head, what is it but dead, Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssioners are left behind it is true, but yet the Land receives the more courage while their King is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, concerning State affayires, then is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived they can, he being absent.</p>
            <p>I very well know, that when his Majestie came first hither, it was not his Royall intent to stay so longe, but promised a speedy returne, which is well known unto your selves, as others, and yet doe I perceive that you are all sicke of a lingring di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease, that I am forced to confesse that there have many great disturbances concerning the State, and many Treacheries are daily discovered, but yet my Lords consider, distractions are as well in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as in this Kingdome, Religion there claymes its due, which is to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a private danger, which is both wicked &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to the Common wealth.</p>
            <p>The one may destroy some perticular persons, but the other destroyes a whole Commonwealth, where but in part a Kingdome halts concerning Religion, great danger must needs hang over the head of the whole, as long as errour is crowned, truth must consequently be dispossessed of its right and it behoves a King to defend the right.</p>
            <p>Why is our Soveraigne stiled the defender of the faith, but to defend the righteous &amp; just, for where there is neither right nor justice, Faith cannot sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96384:3"/>To bring the first part of my intents to a period, it is requisite that the returne of the King be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger delayd.</p>
            <p>Let not <hi>England</hi> be deceived any longer of its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnall expectation, least danger be heaped on your heads, for why it is already suspected, that you keepe him here for no Loyall intents.</p>
            <p>Although I must confesse that his Entertayne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath beene such amongst you; that Envy it selfe, can finde no just cause to complaine, and ever since his Majestie hath beene here, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny, but that he hath beene willing to condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to your Demands.</p>
            <p>The Castle of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> is discharged of all it's forces, the Souldiers are disbanded, and the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances dismounted, although <hi>Carleile</hi> as yet have not yeelded to doe the like, yet no wtong is offered by them, but they wish well to both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and the Soveraigne thereof.</p>
            <p>His Majestie subscribes to any thing that is Lawfull, and hath yeelded to all things hitherto according to justice, and he being absent hath given his power into your hands, wherefore it is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite my Lords, that he returne home into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> all delay being put aside, so shall you
<pb facs="tcp:96384:4"/>
stop the mouthes of all which be apt to report the worst.</p>
            <p>Now my Lords, give me way to speake for my selfe, for I have hitherto spoken in the behalfe of my Soveraigne the King.</p>
            <p>When first I intended, according to my degree, to take my place in this house of Parliament, both my selfe, and the Marquisse of <hi>Hamilton</hi> were disturbed, and must not be permitted hither with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a subscribing to the Covenant, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of yours wee seemed not to disobey.</p>
            <p>And yet daily doe I heare mutterings and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murings, as if both of us were unworthy to receive such honours, and blame me not, if at this time you perceive me untongue-tyed, so much as now at length I am forced to speake.</p>
            <p>Can it bee the lowlinesse or basenesse of our births, which doe force such ill conjectures of us, or have you knowne us to be either Traytors or Rebels to our King or Countrey, from whence I wonder then doth issue, such unheard of Rumors, I thinke, nay I dare avouch it, that neither of us in a just and right cause would be Tymerous to loose our bloods in your defence.</p>
            <p>My Lords, let not Loyall hearts be accounted as those which be treacherous, let <hi>Caesar</hi> have his due, and let not the just be wronged, I know that there be some here present, which wonder how my exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated passion, could be so long cohibited, I have now
<pb facs="tcp:96384:4"/>
utteedr my mind, judge of it as your Lordships shall please; my Conclusion shall bee as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that <hi>Caesar</hi> may have his due, and that the just may not be wronged.</p>
