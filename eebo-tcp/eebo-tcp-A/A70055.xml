            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>I have been much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided
with this burning of the
Temple of <hi>Epheſus;</hi> all <hi>Greece</hi> rung
of it; but 'tis a ſad thing, in earneſt,

                  <speaker>Demet.</speaker>
                  <p>I think you had beſt to
complain of the injuſtice has been
done you in deteſting ſo brave an
Action, and of the Law whereby
the <hi>Epheſians</hi> forbad that no one

of <hi>Heroſtrates.</hi>

down-right People, they were not
ſenſible, that in prohibiting me to
be named, was the only way to
render my Name immortal. But
what ground was there for this
Law? I was deſirous beyond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
to make my ſelf ſpoken of,
and I ſet their Temple on fire.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:39462:4"/>
Ought not they to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
happy, that my Ambition
was not more expenſive to them.
They could not have come off at
an eaſier rate. Another would have
perhaps deſtroyed their whole
Town, State and all.</p>

                  <speaker>Demet.</speaker>
                  <p>To hear you, one would
ſay, you had a Right to ſpare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that might make you be
ſpoken of, and that People ought
to take (as a favour) all the Evils
you have not committed.</p>

                  <speaker>Heroſt.</speaker>
                  <p>It is eaſie to prove the
Right I had to burn the Temple
of <hi>Epheſus.</hi> Why did they Build
it with ſuch Art and Magnificence?
Did not the Architect deſign to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate
his Name?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Demet.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis like enough.</p>

                  <speaker>Heroſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Well then, 'twas to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate
my Name too, that I burnt
this Temple.</p>

                  <speaker>Demet.</speaker>
                  <p>A fine Argument! is it
lawful for you to deſtroy, for your
Glory's ſake, the Works of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:39462:4"/>
                  <speaker>Heroſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes. Vanity which built
this Temple by the Hands of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
has been able to deſtroy it
by the means of mine. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered
with a Right over all the
Works of Mankind; Vanity made
them all, and Vanity can reduce
them again to nothing. The grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
States of all, have no reaſon to
complain that ſhe ſubverts them,
when ſhe has her ends therein;
they could not make out an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal
Independent of Vanity. A
King, who, to Honour the Funerals
of an Horſe, ſhould cauſe the Town
of <hi>Bucephalia</hi> to be razed, would
he deal unjuſtly with it? I think
not, for there was no thought of
building up this Town, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
the Memory of <hi>Bucephalus;</hi>
and ſo by conſequence, it is affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Honour of Horſes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Demet.</speaker>
                  <p>In your Judgment, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
would be ſafe. I know not
whether Men would.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Heroſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Vanity ſports her ſelf
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:39462:5"/>
with their Lives, as with all things
elſe. A Father leaves as many Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
as he can, to keep up his
Name. A Conquerour deſtroys as
many Men as he can, to perpetuate
his.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Demet.</speaker>
                  <p>I do not wonder that you
make uſe of all manner of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to juſtfie Deſtroyers; but in
fine, if pulling down the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of anothers Glory, is a
means to ſet up ones own, it is at
leaſt the meaneſt of all means.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Heroſt.</speaker>
                  <p>I know not whether it
be meaner than the other; but I
very well know that it is requiſite
there ſhould be ſuch Perſons as do
uſe it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Demet.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Heroſt.</speaker>
                  <p>Moſt certainly. The
Earth is like a great Table-Book,
where every one will Write his
Name. When this Book is full,
thoſe Names which are already ſet
down in it muſt needs be blotted
out, for new ones to be writ. What
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:39462:5"/>
would it be, if all the Monuments
of the Ancients were in being?
The Modern People would have
no room to ſet up theirs in. Could
you hope that your three hundred
and ſixty Statues would be of any
long ſtanding? Did you not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that there was ſcarce place
enough for your Glory?</p>

                  <p>'Twas a pleaſant kind of

                  <p>FOR my part, I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that a Woman is
in danger ſo ſoon as ſhe is beloved
with eagerneſs. What does not a

of to compaſs his Deſigns? I ſtood
it out a long time with <hi>Mundus,</hi>
a handſome young <hi>Roman;</hi> but in
fine, he got the Victory by a ſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem.
I was very devout to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubis</hi>
the God. One day a ſhe
Prieſt of this God came and told
me from him, that he was in love
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:39462:6"/>
with me, and that he deſired I
would give him the meeting in his
Temple. Miſtreſs to <hi>Anubis!</hi> Judge
you what an Honour. I failed not
to be at the Rendez-vous, I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with great manifeſtations
of kindneſs; but to tell you the
truth, this <hi>Anubis</hi> was <hi>Mundus.</hi> See
whether I could withſtand him.
They ſay indeed, that ſome Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
have yielded to Gods that
were diſguiſed like Men, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
like Beaſts; much more ought
one to yield to Men diſguiſed like

                  <p>Truly, Men are full of Guiles.
I ſpeak by experience, and the ſame
chance almoſt has happened to me
as to you. I was a <hi>Trojan</hi> Laſs,
and juſt upon the point of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
I went, according to the
uſual manner of the Country, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by a vaſt number of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
and finely dreſſed, to offer
up my Virginity to the River <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander.</hi>
Having made my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:39462:7"/>
out comes <hi>Scamander</hi> from
amongſt the Ruſhes, and takes me
at my word. I thought my ſelf
very much honoured, and ſo did
every one elſe perhaps, I will not
except my Betrothed. All kept
a reſpectful ſilence; my Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
did ſecretly envy my happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and <hi>Scamander</hi> retired into
his Ruſhes when he would him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.
But how ſurprized was I, one

walking up and down in a little

he was an <hi>Athenian</hi> Captain,

                  <speaker>Paul.</speaker>
                  <p>What would you have?
I heard all the Wiſer ſort ſay, that
if we did not help to deceive our
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:39462:8"/>
own ſelves, our Pleaſures would be
but few.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Call.</speaker>
                  <p>That's a good one; help
to deceive ones ſelf! in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
they took it not in that ſenſe.
Their meaning was, that the moſt
delightful things of the World, if
throughly look'd into, had ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
in them, that they would make
but ſmall impreſſion, if People did
make the leaſt ſerious reflection on
them. Pleaſures are not deſigned
for a ſtrict Examination, and we
are every day reduced to befriend
them in many things, wherein it
would be improper for us to make
any difficulties. This is what your
Wiſe-Ones—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Paul.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis what I would ſay too;
if I had ſtood upon Tearms with
<hi>Anubis,</hi> I ſhould even have found
that he was no God; But I owned
his Divinity, being unwilling to
examine it with over much curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.
And where is the Lover that
would be entertain'd, if he were
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:39462:8"/>
obliged to undergo an Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our Reaſon?</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Call.</speaker>
                  <p>Mine was not ſo ſtrict. Such
a Lover might be found, as my
Reaſon would conſent I might love;
and 'tis in fine, more eaſie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
one is beloved of a ſincere
and faithful Man, than of a God.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Paul.</speaker>
                  <p>In earneſt, 'tis one and the
ſame thing. I ſhould have been

was true and conſtant, as that he
was a God.</p>

                  <p>Ah! there's nothing ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
as what you ſay. If we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that Gods have loved, we
can't, at leaſt, believe that ſuch a
thing has been frequent; but we
have often ſeen faithful Lovers that
did not divide their heart, but did
Sacrifice all to their Miſtreſſes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Paul.</speaker>
                  <p>If you take for true marks
of Fidelity, the diligences, the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs
of Sacrifices, an entire pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
I grant there will be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Lovers enough found out; but
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:39462:9"/>
I don't reckon ſo. I ſtrike out of
the number of thoſe Lovers, all
thoſe whoſe paſſion has not been
of that continuance as to have
had time to ceaſe of it ſelf, or ſo
happy as to have had ſome cauſe
for it. I have no more to reckon,
but ſuch as have held out againſt
time, and againſt favours, and they
are neer as many in number as the
Gods are that have loved Mortals.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Call.</speaker>
                  <p>Still according to this ſame
Idea, there muſt be ſome Fidelity
in being. For let a Man go tell a
Woman, that he is a God, taken
with her Merits, ſhe'l not believe
it; let a Man ſwear he'l be true to
her, ſhe will believe him. Why this
difference? 'Tis becauſe there are
Examples of th'one, and there are
none of th'other.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Paul.</speaker>
                  <p>For Examples, I hold the
matter equal; but the Reaſon why
we fall not into the Errour of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Man for a God, is that this
ſame Errour is not upheld by the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:39462:9"/>
heart. We don't believe that a
Lover is a Divinity, becauſe we
don't deſire he ſhould be ſo; but
we wiſh he may be faithful, and
we believe he is.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Call.</speaker>
                  <p>You jeer now. What Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
would take their Lovers for
Gods, if they did wiſh them ſuch?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Paul.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſcarce doubt it: If this
miſtake were neceſſary for Love,
Nature would have diſpoſed our
heart to inſpire it into us. The
heart is the original of all the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
we need; it denies us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in this Point.</p>

                  <p>What could I do? The

the hidden Beauties of the Queen,
ſhe ſent for me, ſhe told me ſhe
had diſcovered that you brought
me over-night into her Chamber,
and made me a very fair Diſcourſe
upon the offence which her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
had received, the concluſion
of it was, that I muſt reſolve to

her; for, as ſhe pretended, it
concerned her Honour, that I ſhould
either enjoy what I had ſeen, or
that I could never boaſt of having
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:39462:10"/>
ſeen it. I underſtood very well
the meaning of all this. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury
was not ſo great, but the
Queen might have diſſembled it,
and her Honour might have let
you live, if ſhe had been willing;
but to be free with you, ſhe was
out of conceit with you, and ſhe
was overcome with Joy, that ſhe
had a pretence of Glory to rid her
ſelf of her Husband. You ſee
well enough, that in the alternative

The other day I heard one of the
Dead that had been King of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi>
make a Relation, How he was
led Captive, and loaden with
Chains into the Capital City of
a great Empire. The Victorious
Emperour was Seated on a moſt
Stately Throne, and environed of
all his Courtiers; the People were
gathered together in a ſpacious
Square, which was fitted up with
conveniences for the purpoſe. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
was Spectacle attended with
greater Pomp. When this King
appeared in the Reer of a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:39462:12"/>
of Priſoners and Spoils, he
made a ſtop full againſt <hi>the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour,
and cryed out with</hi> a merry
Countenance, <hi>Folly, Folly, and all
is Folly.</hi> He ſaid that theſe words
alone ſpoiled the Emperours whole
Triumph; and I am ſo ſenſible of
it, that I believe I ſhould not have
been willing to triumph at that
rate over the moſt Cruel and moſt
Dreadful of my Enemies.</p>

                  <p>You would not have loved

                  <p>I muſt needs ſay that my

I will not ſay this to another
Dead, but in his Ear; the Vanity
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:39462:12"/>
of gaining Love from a Miſtreſs
is not ſo great. Nature has ſo well
eſtabliſhed the Traffick of Love,
that there is but little left for
Merit to do. She has deſigned to
each heart another heart; and ſhe
has not taken care to match to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
at all times, all ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
as be worthy of eſteem; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
there is a great mixture, and
Experience does make it too well
known, that the choice of a love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Woman is of little or no avail
to him on whom it falls. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks
theſe ſame Reaſons ſhould

all Love concerns. At firſt, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
Honour is concern'd, which
is quite oppoſite to the Intereſts
of Lovers; and then the wrack of
this ſame Honour makes way for
Lovers to deſign another, that is
very much againſt the Intereſts of
Women. See what it is to have
placed Honour on the wrong ſide.</p>

a thing which <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus</hi>
told me of late. Is it true,
that you had a kindneſs for him,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:39462:13"/>
but he making no return, you
encouraged your Husband <hi>Mark
Anthony</hi> to enter into War with

                  <p>Nothing more true, my
Dear <hi>Helene;</hi> for among we Dead
Women, this confeſſion is of no
conſequence. <hi>Mark Anthony</hi> was
mad in Love with <hi>Citherida</hi> the
<hi>Comedian,</hi> and I wiſhed I could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged
of him, by making my ſelf
beloved of <hi>Auguſtus;</hi> but <hi>Auguſtus</hi>
was hard to pleaſe in Miſtreſſes.
He neither thought me young e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
nor handſom enough; and
though I let him underſtand, that
he was engaging himſelf in a Civil
War, meerly becauſe he neglected
me, I could not poſſible make him
comply in the leaſt. Nay, I will
recite you, if you will, ſome
Verſes he made about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

                  <p>You and I then have

were; you, of that betwixt <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi>

                  <p>For amends, you have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
advantage over me; it is that
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:39462:14"/>
your War is far more pleaſant
than mine. My Husband revenges
himſelf of the Affront offered him
in anothers loving me, and that
is pretty natural; your Husband
revenges you of the Affront done
you, becauſe you were not loved
of another, that is not very or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
with Husbands.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fulvia.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, but <hi>Anthony</hi> knew
not that he made War upon my
account, and <hi>Menelaus</hi> knew well
enough that it was for you he
Warred. In this particular he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable;
for whereas <hi>Menelaus</hi>
being followed by the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of <hi>Greece,</hi> did lay. Siege to
<hi>Troy,</hi> for the ſpace of ten years,
that he might recover you from
out of the Arms of <hi>Paris,</hi> is not
it true, that if <hi>Paris</hi> would have
yielded you up, <hi>Menelans</hi> had been
obliged to withſtand a ten years
Siege in <hi>Sparta,</hi> for not receiving
you? In earneſt, I ſee they had
all loſt their Senſes, both <hi>Greeks</hi> and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:39462:15"/>
                     <hi>Troians.</hi> The firſt were Fools ſo
demanding you again. The other
were yet greater Fools for retaining
you. How chance ſo many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of Honour did Sacrifice them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the Pleaſures of a young
Man that knew not what he did?
I could not forbear laughing, as
I read that paſſage in <hi>Homer,</hi> where
after a nine years Siege, and a
late Battel, wherein a world of
Men were loſt, a Council is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
before <hi>Priamus</hi>'s Palace. There,
<hi>Antenor</hi> is for yielding you up,
and methinks there was no doubt
in the caſe; all is, they ought to
blame themſelves they did not
ſooner think of this Expedient.
Yet <hi>Paris</hi> ſeems diſpleaſed at the
Propoſition; and <hi>Priamus</hi> who, as
<hi>Homer</hi> relates, is equal to the Gods
in Wiſdom, being troubled to ſee
his Council divided upon ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
a Point, and not knowing
which ſide to take, gives Order that
every one ſhould go to Supper.</p>

                  <p>There was, at leaſt, this
of good in the <hi>Trojan</hi> War, the
<hi>ridicule</hi> of it was eaſily found out;
but the Civil War of <hi>Auguſtus</hi> and
<hi>Anthony,</hi> appeared otherways than
it was. When ſo many <hi>Roman</hi> Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
were ſeen in the Field, People
could little imagine that the thing
that did egg them on ſo cruelly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
one another, was <hi>Auguſtus</hi>
his refuſal to love you.</p>

Their motions are great, but the

                  <p>Ah! you do not think
of what you ſay. I had like to
have died of that ſerious Temper
you covet ſo much. Nothing did
delight me; I did all I could to
laugh, and could not compaſs it. I
took no farther Pleaſure in the <hi>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule</hi>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:39462:17"/>
of the World, this <hi>Ridicule</hi>
was become ſad to me. In fine,
being in deſpair upon my proving
ſo ſober, I went to <hi>Delphos,</hi> and
I begged earneſtly of the God to
teach me a means to laugh. He
turned me off in ambiguous terms,
to the Maternal Power. I thought
that by the Maternal Power, he
meant my native Country. I go
back again into it, but my Country
could not overcome my ſerious
mood. I began to muſe upon it,
as in an incurable Diſeaſe, when
by chance I made a Journy to
<hi>Delos.</hi> There I did contemplate
with admiration, the Magnificence of
<hi>Apollo</hi>'s Temples, and the Beauty
of his Statues. He was all about
in Marble, or in Gold, and made
by the beſt Work-men of <hi>Greece;</hi>
but when I came to a <hi>Latona</hi> of
Wood, that was very ill made, and
had the Countenance of an Old
Woman, I burſt out in laughing,
when I compared the Son's Statues
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:39462:17"/>
with that of the Mother. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
expreſs how much I was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized,
ſatisfied, and taken with my
having laughed. Then I did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the true meaning of the
Oracle. I made not an Offering
to all thoſe <hi>Apollo's</hi> of Gold and
Marble. The Wooden <hi>Latona</hi> had
all my Preſents, and all my Vows.
I made it I know not how many
Sacrifices. I all beſmoaked it with
Incenſe; and if I had been in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to bear the charge of it, I
would have builded a Temple, <hi>To</hi>
Latona <hi>that cauſeth laughing.</hi>

                  <p>Methinks <hi>Apollo</hi> might
reſtore you the faculty of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,

You would have diſcovered but too

the ſame Effect as <hi>Latona</hi> did.</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:39462:18"/>
that takes upon her to be ſo,
that is very wonderful. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<hi>Apollo</hi> in all likelyhood had

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:39462:18"/>

Ambaſſadours, they turned
them into <hi>ridicule;</hi> if they held
the Town Council, the Advices of
the Graveſt Senators, were meer
Buffooniſm; in ſhort, a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Word or Action, would have
been a Prodigy with the <hi>Tirinthians.</hi>
They found themſelves troubled
with this Spirit of merryment, at
leaſt as much as you had been
troubled with your ſadneſs, and
they went and conſulted the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of <hi>Delphos,</hi> as well as you, but for a
very different end, that is, they went
to ask him by what means they
might recover a little ſeriouſneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
The Oracle made anſwer,
that if they could Sacrifice a Bull
to <hi>Neptune</hi> without laughing, they
might have it in their power to be
more wiſe. A Sacrifice is of it ſelf
no pleaſant action; however to the
end they might perform it in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
manner, they uſed many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives.
They reſolved to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:39462:19"/>
admit of no Young People, but
Old People only, and not of all ſorts
of Old Men neither, but of ſuch
only as were either full of Diſeaſes,
or up to the Ears in debt, or very
troubleſom Women. When all
theſe choice Perſons were upon the
Sea ſide, to immolate the Victime,
notwithſtanding the Women, Debts,
Diſeaſes, and Age, they were fain
to ſettle their Countenances, caſt
their Eyes down upon the ground,
and bite their Lips; but by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune
a little Boy had crept in
amongſt them. They would have
driven him away, according to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and he cryed out; <hi>What? are
you afraid I ſhould eat up your Bull?</hi>
This folly put them quite out of
thoſe counterfeit gravities. They
burſt out into laughing, the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
was interrupted, and the <hi>Tirin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
remained void of Reaſon.
They were much to blame, after
they had miſcarried in their Bull,
they did not bethink themſelves
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:39462:19"/>
of this Cave of <hi>Trophonius,</hi> that had

They exerciſe it in Marriage, that

When they require a Miſtreſs
to be faithful to them; by faithful is

I have heard ſay, that about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years after your Death, a <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi>
Philoſopher did beg of the then
reigning Emperour, a ſmall ruined
Town of <hi>Calabria,</hi> that he might
build it up again, eſtabliſh the Laws
of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Common-wealth in it,
and call it <hi>Platonopole;</hi> but the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
would not by any means
grant the Philoſopher his deſire, and
had not ſo much confidence in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<hi>Plato</hi>'s reaſon, as to give him
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:39462:27"/>
the Government of this petty Town.
See by this, how much Reaſon is
cried down. If it did deſerve to be
eſteemed ever ſo little, who ſhould
eſteem it but men; however, Men
themſelves value it not.</p>

                  <p>It is true, that the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers

but it is fit Men ſhould ſeek for it.
In ſeeking for it, there are many

                  <p>All Sciences have their
Chymera, they hunt for it, and
are not able to lay hold of it; but
they pick up by the way other ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

her Philoſophers Stone, Geometry
hath its Circular ſquare, Aſtrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
her Longitudes, the Mechanicks
their perpetual Motion; 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to find all this out, but 'tis uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to look for it. I ſpeak to you
of things which perhaps you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
not very well, but you may
at leaſt, underſtand that Moral Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
has its Chymera too: and
that is, <hi>a waving of ones private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,</hi>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:39462:30"/>

                  <p>Once more, I ſhould be

                  <speaker>R. Lullus.</speaker>
                  <p>Would you believe it?
In all things Men muſt propoſe to
themſelves a degree of Perfection,
which does not ſo much as come
within their reach. They would
never ſettle to any thing, if they
believed they ſhould attain no more,
than what they will really attain to;
it is neceſſary they ſhould propoſe
to themſelves an imaginary ſcope of
things to egg them on. Whoever
ſhould have told me, that Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
could not have taught me to
make Gold, I would have forbore
it. Whoever ſhould have told you,
that the extream Fidelity, you ſo
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:39462:30"/>
much ſtood upon, in reference to
your Husband, was not Natural,
you would not have taken the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Memory with ſo ſumptuous a
Tomb. Men would be out of heart,
if they were not ſupported by falſe
Ideas.</p>

                  <p>How? Should each Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

But you, that blame my advice,
it concerns you more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

were new pleaſures, how would
you ever be contented, ſince you
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:39462:34"/>
were not reſerved to live in the

have made your Advantage of
the Diſcoveries of all former Ages?

believed. I perceive the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of Notions is no great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ſince they are left to any
that will catch them up; and ſince
that Nature has not troubled her
ſelf to make Men of former and
future Ages equal upon this account;
but Pleaſures are of greater value,
it would have been a very unjuſt

                  <p>I aſſure you, if I am
for Prejudications, 'tis not for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
ſake; on the contrary, whilſt
I was in the World, they were a
great <hi>Ridicule</hi> to me. They were
trying at <hi>Rome</hi> to ſave ſome Statues,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:39462:40"/>
that were fallen under the Ruins,
and I being a good Carver, and a
good Painter, I was made choice of,
to judge whether they were Pieces
of Antiquity or not. <hi>Michael An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelo,</hi>
my Competitor, did private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
make a Statue of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> and
rarely well he made it. Having fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
it, he broke off one of the
Fingers, and buried it in a place,
where he knew they would dig.
They had no ſooner found it, but
I declared it to be a piece of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
<hi>Michael Angelo</hi> maintained
it was a Modern Piece. I grounded
my Judgment chiefly upon the
Beauty of the Statue, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the principles of Art,
might paſs for the Workmanſhip of
ſome <hi>Greek</hi> Hand; and being ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
oppoſed, I run this <hi>Bacchus</hi> up
to the time, wherein <hi>Polycletes</hi> and
<hi>Phidias</hi> did flouriſh. At laſt <hi>Micha-An<gap reason="illegible: missing" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>gelo</hi>
ſhews the broken Finger,
which was an Argument not to be
oppoſed. I was laughed at for my
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:39462:41"/>
preoccupation; but what I could I
have done without this preoccupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
I was Judge, and that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
forceth one to a Deciſion.</p>

                  <speaker>R. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin.</speaker>
                  <p>And does Reaſon decide
things? By conſulting her, I ſhould
never have known, whether the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
had been a piece of Antiquity or
not, I ſhould only have known that it
was a very fine piece. But Prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
comes and tells me, that a
fine Statute muſt be a piece of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity;
here's a Deciſion, and I Judge.</p>

                  <p>It is very probable, that
Reaſon might not ſupply Men with
undeniable Principles in matters of
ſo little Conſequence, as this is; but
in reference to all that concerns the
Conduct of Men, ſhe is ſure in her
Deciſions; the miſchief is, they do
not conſult her.</p>

                  <p>Let us conſult <hi>her</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

how ſhe concludes. Let us ask <hi>her,</hi>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:39462:41"/>
whether we ſhould cry or laugh at
the Death of Friends, and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Here ſhe'll tell you, they can
do you no farther good, you muſt
Weep. Again, they are freed from
the miſeries of Life, Rejoyce then.
Theſe are the Anſwers of Reaſon;
but the cuſtom of our Country tells
us, what we muſt do in this caſe.
We Weep, if the Cuſtom be ſuch,
and that ſo bitterly, that we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
it to be impoſſible we could
laugh, upon that ſcore; or elſe we
Laugh, and that ſo heartily, that we
think it impoſſible we could weep.</p>

but how exact are the Ideas,

               <sp>
                  <speaker>R. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin.</speaker>
                  <p>Becauſe the infallible
Maxims, which Reaſon propoſes
to us, are too few in number, and
our mind is made to believe more.
Thus the ſurpluſage of <hi>her</hi> Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to believe redounds to the
profit of Prejudications.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Stra.</speaker>
                  <p>And may not a Man ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
his Judgment? Reaſon is at a

                  <p>You are in the right;
Reaſon has but one Secret to keep
her ſelf from going aſtray, and that
is, not to move a ſtep. When <hi>ſhe</hi>
finds the way does ſeparate in two,
<hi>ſhe</hi> is at a ſtand; but this is a violent
State for the Mind of Man; it is
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:39462:42"/>
in motion, and muſt have its full
career. 'Tis not every one, that
knows how to make doubts, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to that, a man had need of a
good inſight into things, and
ſtrength to hold there. Moreover
Doubt is void of Action, and Men
are for Action.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Stra.</speaker>
                  <p>Prejudications ſhould not
be cuſtomary neither, if one man
would act like another; but if he
will think as a wiſe man ſhould,
he muſt rid himſelf of the Prejudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Mind.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>R. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbin.</speaker>
                  <p>It is better to keep
them all. I ſee you do not know
the two Anſwers which the Old
<hi>Samnite</hi> made for his Country Men,
when they ſent to know of him
what they ſhould do after they had
ſhut up the whole Army of the
<hi>Romans,</hi> their mortal Enemies, in
the Straits of <hi>Candinium,</hi> and had
it in their power to do with them,
as they pleaſed. The Old Man
made anſwer, that they ſhould put
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:39462:43"/>
all the <hi>Romans</hi> to the Sword. His
Counſel ſeemed too hard and too
cruel, and the <hi>Samnites</hi> ſent to him,
to let him underſtand the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
of it. The Old Man's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
was, that they ſhould ſpare
the <hi>Romans</hi> Lives, without making
any Articles. Neither of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
was followed, and they ſmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for it. It is juſt ſo with Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications,
they muſt either be all
preſerved, or all quite laid aſide. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
thoſe, which you have
caſt off, make you begin to miſtruſt
all your other Opinions. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs
of being deceived in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things has no amends from
the pleaſure of being deceived with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowing it; and you neither
enjoy the bright beams of Truth,
nor the delights of Error.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Stra.</speaker>
                  <p>If the Alternative, you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
be unavoidable, a man need
not ſtand ſtudying which ſide he'll
take. Away then with all your
Prejudications.</p>

                  <p>But Reaſon will drive
all former Opinions out of our
mind, without ſupplying it with
new ones. Wiſdom is a kind of
<hi>Vacuum.</hi> And who can maintain
that? No, no, with that little
Reaſon men are indued, they muſt
ſtill have their uſual allowance of
Prejudications. They are the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
of Reaſon. What is wanting
in the one, is made good in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

Emperour, <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, had
an Intrigue with the Princeſs I told
you of, and I was made uſe of for
a Blind; but the concern went far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
beſides this, the Princeſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
me, I would be Mother to a
young Prince newly born; to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
her, I conſented. Now you'll
wonder! Have you not heard ſay,
that whatever our Merit is, we
muſt ſtill be above that Merit,
through the little eſteem we ought
to make of it; that your Wits, for
example, ought in this manner to
be above their Talent in that kind?
For my part, I was above my Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,
I had more than I deſired.</p>

you expoſed yours in great ſtate;
nay, you would not kill your ſelf,

Glory is grounded upon nothing
but the Imagination, and is far
more Powerful Reaſon her ſelf
would not allow that Men ſhould
ſubmit themſelves to her Conduct
alone. She knows but too well,
that ſhe ſtands in need of the help
of the Imagination. When <hi>Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>
was juſt going to ſacrifice him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
for his Country, and was ready
to leap, armed as he was on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
into that Gulf which broke
out in the middle of <hi>Rome,</hi> if one
ſhould have ſaid to him, <hi>You ought in
duty to caſt your ſelf into this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice;
but reſt aſſured, that no body
will ever ſpeak of your Action:</hi> in
earneſt, I am much afraid, <hi>Curtius</hi>
would have made his Horſe go back
again. For my part, I cannot ſay,
that I ſhould have killed my ſelf
upon a bare Conſideration of my
Duty. Why, kill my ſelf? I ſhould
have believed that my Duty was
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:39462:47"/>
not injured through the Violence
that was offered me: at the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt,

my ſelf.</p>

All Duties, if rightly conſidered,

                  <p>You need not doubt it.
Whilſt I was diverting my ſelf the
other day, I made here a little Tale
upon that Subject. A young Gooſe
did fly with that uncomelineſs as is
uſual to the Kind; and during this
Flight, of a moments laſting, which
raiſed it about a Foot high from the
Ground, it inſulted over the reſt of
the Back-yard Inhabitants. <hi>Ah! you
wretched Creatures,</hi> ſays it, <hi>that I ſee
underneath me, and that know not how
to make your way through the Air!</hi>
But at the ſame time the Gooſe fell
down again.</p>

                  <p>What is the Benefit then of
thoſe Reflexions which your Plays
ſtir up in Man, ſince they are like
the Flight of this Gooſe, and ſince
at the very ſame moment he falls
again into all common Follies?</p>

                  <p>'Tis a great matter, that a
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:39462:54"/>
Man mock'd himſelf. Nature has
made us very apt to it, that ſo we
might not become our own Bubble.
How often does it happen, that
whilſt one Part of us is doing any
thing with eagerneſs, another Part
laughs at the former; and, if need
were too, a third Part might be
found out that would laugh at both
the two firſt. Does not Man ſeem
to be a Compound of Contraries?</p>

                  <p>All this will not much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a Mans Brain. Some ſlight Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,
ſome merry Conceits, that
are many times ill applied, ſuch as
theſe indeed deſerve no great eſteem;
but how muſt a Man ſtrain his

ſo expoſed to the Eyes of the whole

Mans Health; he muſt have it

that did aver the ſame, that when

                  <p>There is ſome Reaſon
for People to be always cheated
with the Promiſes of Philoſophers;
there is a diſcovery made from time
to time of ſome ſmall inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:39462:60"/>
Truths, that amuſe the World
a little; but, I confeſs, there is little
Progreſs made into the depth of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy.
I believe alſo, that in ſome
conſiderable <hi>Points</hi> the Truth is
now and then found out; but the
miſchief is, Men do not know they
have found it: For Philoſophy (I
think a dead Man may ſay what he
liſt) is like a Play which Children
uſe, where one amongſt them runs
blindfold after the reſt: If he catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
any of them, he is obliged to
name him, elſe he muſt let him go,
and then run again. Not but that
we Philoſophers, though our Eyes
be very cloſe hid, do ſometimes lay
hold of the Truth: But what? we
cannot juſtifie it to <hi>her</hi> that 'tis <hi>ſhe</hi>
we have laid hold of, then at that
very inſtant <hi>ſhe</hi> gives us the ſlip.</p>

                  <p>It is but too apparent, that
Truth is not made for us: So, at
laſt you'll ſee, there will be no ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after her, Men will be out of
heart, and be at eaſe.</p>

                  <p>I aſſure you, your Predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

eager of thoſe things which they

that which is denied all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
is reſerved for him alone.
Within theſe four and twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Years, there will come Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers,
that ſhall make it their
Braggs, That they will root out all
thoſe Errours that were in being for

                  <p>If I were to begin again, I
would not be a Falſe <hi>Demetrius,</hi> I
would become a Philoſopher: But
how if People ſhould chance to fall
into a diſlike of Philoſophy, and
deſpair of ever finding out the Truth?
I ſhould ſtill fear this.</p>

                  <p>You had far greater reaſon

Believe it, Men will never be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged.
It would be great pity
they could fall into ſuch Deſpair.
Since your Modern People make as
little diſcovery of the Truth as
your Ancient did, it is but juſt, they
ſhould at leaſt have as great hopes
of diſcovering it. This Hope is
pleaſing, though it be but a vain one.
If Truth be no Right of th' one, nor
of th' other, at leaſt, they Both
have a Right to Errour.</p>

                  <p>I will tell you yet more;

                  <speaker>A. of B.</speaker>
                  <p>Me thinks you ſhould
not reckon up, in the number of
your Advantages, ſome Infidelities
you committed againſt your Lover,
and which, in all likelihood, were
very private: They cannot add to
your Glory. But when I began to
be beloved of the King of <hi>England,</hi>
the People who had been made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with my Adventures, did
not keep them ſecret, and yet I got
the better of Reputation.</p>

                  <speaker>Dutch.</speaker>
                  <p>I could perhaps make it
appear to you, if I would my ſelf,
that I was unfaithful to <hi>Henry</hi> the
Second, though not with ſo much
myſtery as to redound to my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;
but I will not inſiſt upon this
Point. The want of Fidelity may
either be hid, or the Breach made
up again; but how is it poſſible to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:39462:64"/>
hide or repair the want of Youth?
However, I overcame it. I was full
of Tongue, and I made my ſelf be
adored; that's nothing; but I was
grown in Years. You, you were
young, and ſuffered your Head to
be cut off. Though I was a Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother,
I ſhould not have ſuffered

you about your Age neither, which
you make ſuch a Buſineſs of, that
was not ſo hard to diſguiſe as my
Courſe of Life was. I muſt needs
diſturb the Brains of him that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved

                  <p>We were very happy in
our not knowing that there were
any Sciences in the World: We
ſhould not perhaps have had ſo much
Reaſon, as to have avoided being
Learned. People are not always in
a capacity to follow the Example of
the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who took ſuch care to
preſerve themſelves from th' infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of their Neighbour's Sciences.
As for Arts, <hi>America</hi> had found out
ſuch ways to live without them, as
were perhaps more wonderful than
the Arts of <hi>Europe</hi> themſelves. When
one can write, 'tis an eaſie matter to
make Hiſtories; but we knew not
how to write, and yet we made Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories.
It is eaſie, for ſuch as can
build in Water, to make Bridges;
but the difficulty is, to build Bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
and not know how to build in
Water. You muſt remember, that
in our Grounds the <hi>Spaniards</hi> met
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:39462:67"/>
with a great many things that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed
their Underſtanding: I mean,
for Example, Stones of ſuch a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
bigneſs, that they did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
how they were rais'd up to
that height as they were, without
the help of Engins for the purpoſe.
What think you of all this? Me
thinks that hitherto you have not
made it very well appear what the
Advantages of <hi>Europe</hi> are over <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</hi>

                  <p>They are ſufficiently
proved by all that may diſtinguiſh
Civilized People from Barbarous
People. Civility reigns amongſt us;
there is no room for Force and Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence;
Power is moderated by Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
Wars are grounded upon law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Cauſes: See beſides how very
ſcrupulous we were; we did not
make War upon your Country, till
we had ſtrictly examined whether
we had any Right to it, and decided
the Queſtion in our own behalf.</p>

                  <p>Doubtleſs you did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:39462:68"/>
treat Barbarians with more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
than they deſerved. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
your Civility and Juſtice to
one another, is anſwerable to your
ſcrupuloſity with us. Take away
from <hi>Europe</hi> her Formalities, ſhe
will differ little from <hi>America.</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
meaſures all your Steps, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates
all your Words, embroils all
your Diſcourſes, and plagues all your
Actions; but no news of her in
your Principles; and all that Juſtice
which ſhould attend your Deſigns,
is no where met with but in your
Pretences.</p>

                  <p>I cannot anſwer for Mens
Hearts; we onely ſee their Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.
An Heir that loſes a Father,
and gets ſtore of <hi>Means,</hi> puts on
Mourning Clothes: Does he grieve
much? In all appearance, he does
not. Yet if he did not put himſelf
into Mourning, he would injure
Reaſon.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mont.</speaker>
                  <p>I underſtand your meaning.
Reaſon does not rule among you,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:39462:68"/>
but ſhe makes a Proteſtation, That
things ſhould be carried on in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manner than they are; That
Heirs, for example, ſhould la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
their Parents: They admit
this Proteſtation; and for better
proof thereof, they clothe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in Black. Your Formalities
ſerve onely to ſhew a Right which
Reaſon has, and which you will not
let her execute; and you do not do,
but you repreſent what you ſhould
do.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F. Cort.</speaker>
                  <p>And is not that very
much? Reaſon bears ſo little ſway
among you, that ſhe cannot ſo much
as come to give you the leaſt hint of
what you ſhould do.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Montez.</speaker>
                  <p>But you think of her to
as little purpoſe, as ſome of your
<hi>Greeks</hi> did think of their firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
They were ſetled in <hi>Tuſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>
a Barbarous Country as they
thought; and they had by little and
little ſo accuſtomed themſelves to
the ways of that Country, that they
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:39462:69"/>
had forgotten their own ways: Yet
they ſeem'd concerned at their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grown Barbarous, and they met
together every year, upon a certain
prefix'd day; they read over their
ancient Laws in <hi>Greek,</hi> which they
had laid aſide, and ſcarce ſo much as
underſtood them; they wept, and
then ſeparated: They no ſooner
came out of that Place, but they
merrily betook themſelves to the
manner of Living of the Country.
They ſtood upon the <hi>Greek</hi> Laws,
as you do upon Reaſon: They
knew there were ſuch Laws in the
World, they ſpoke of them, yet
ſlightly, and without any benefit.
Notwithſtanding, they did in ſome
manner grieve for them; but you
are not concerned that you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
Reaſon; you have taken an
habit to know her, and deſpiſe her.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>F. Cort.</speaker>
                  <p>By this means a Man
may, at leaſt, be more enabled to
follow her, than better'd in the
knowledge of her.</p>

                  <speaker>Montez.</speaker>
                  <p>And herein onely we
yield to you? Ah! How unhappy
were we, that we had not Ships to
go and diſcover your Countries?
And why did not we bethink our
ſelves of determining the Caſe, and
declare, That they belonged to us?
We ſhould have had as much Right
to conquer Them, as you had to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
Ours.</p>
