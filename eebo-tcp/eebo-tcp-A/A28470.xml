         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>THomas Ford,</hi> a known Recuſant b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of <hi>Eliz.</hi> for money lent to <hi>Sheldon;</hi> ſome
before, and ſome after the ſaid 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> took
Recognizance in the Names of others, and
alſo a Rent-charge to them in Fee, with a
Clauſe of Redemption by Deed; the Condition of the
Recognizance, being for performance of the Covenanss
in the Deeds; and afterward was made the Statute of the
28 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which was, That as often as any Failer was
made, in the payment of 20 <hi>l.</hi> a Month, that ſo often the
Queen, by Proceſs out of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> might take and
enjoy all the Goods, and two Parts &amp;c. And after the
ſaid Act, <hi>Ford</hi> lent the ſeveral Sums of Money, and
took the Securities as aforeſaid, amounting in all to
21000 <hi>l.</hi> which being to <hi>Ford</hi>'s uſe, were all forfeited.
Afterwards, 41 <hi>Eliz.</hi> was Convict of Recuſancy, and did
not pay the 20 <hi>l.</hi> a Month: If the King ſhould have
the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nefit of theſe Recognizances and Securities, was

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſtion.</p>
               <p>1. Upon Debate, it was objected by <hi>Ford</hi>'s Councel,
That the Recognizances had not been Forfeited, though
they had been made in <hi>Ford</hi>'s Name; the Statute ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
onely of Goods, which doth not include Debts. As
if the King grant all the Goods of J. S. coming to him
by Attainder, the Patentee ſhall not have Debts: And
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57645:3"/>
a Penal Law ſhall not be extended by Equity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. That three Recognizances are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Intention of the Act, being Savers of the Realty,
and acknowledged to perform Covenants, as to the Rent-charge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> 3. No Fraud was in the Caſe: And then no
Statute being in this Caſe, the Common-Law gives no
benefit to the King. As if <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> had been Attaint
of Treaſon, the Uſe being but a Truſt could not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited
to the King: And it not a Uſe, <hi>A multo fortiori,</hi> a
meer Truſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ob.</hi> 4. What Forfeiture accrues to the King in this
Caſe, muſt be by force of the words <hi>(Goods)</hi> in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
which cannot be, <hi>Ford</hi> having no Goods but a meer
Truſt. Alſo, one Recognizance was taken in the Names
of others before the Stature, and therefore cannot be
thought to defeat the King of a Forfeiture which was not
then in uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſolved</hi> 1. By all the Barons, and <hi>Popham</hi> Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of <hi>England,</hi> and divers other Juſtices, that Perſonal
Actions are as well included within this Word <hi>(Goods)</hi>
in an Act of Parliament, as Goods in Poſſeſſion: But
becauſe by Law, things in Action cannot be granted o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
therefore by General Grant, without ſpecial words,
can never paſs. And where the Statute ſaith, <hi>Shall take,
ſeize, and enjoy all the Goods, and two parts,</hi> &amp;c. the King
may well enjoy a Debt due to a Recuſant, and by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
out of the <hi>Exchequer</hi> Levy it: and ſo <hi>take and ſeize,</hi>
refers to Goods, and two Parts of Lands in Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſolved</hi> 2. That it was Originally for the Loan of
Money, and both the Recognizance and Annuity were to
ſecure the ſaid Money. And Recognizances fotfeited, are
but Chattels Perſonal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſolved</hi> 3. There was Covin apparent; for he being
a Recuſant always as aforeſaid, and ſo chargeable to the
King, his taking the Recognizances in the Name of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57645:3"/>
ſhall be Conſtrued with an Intent to prevent the
King of his Forfeiture: And ſo ſhall all Recognizan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
taken in others Names, after the ſaid Act, be preſumed
to be taken. As to <hi>Ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               <head>Caſe of Forfeiture by Treaſon.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hill</hi> 43 <hi>Eliz.</hi> A Caſe was moved to all the Juſtices:
Tenant in Tayl before the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. made a
Feoffment in Fee to the uſe of himſelf, and his Wife in
Tayl. And after the ſaid Statute, the Husband was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taint
of High Treaſon, 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and dyed. The Wife
continued in poſſeſſion and dyed, their Iſſue enter and
die, and this deſcends to his Iſſue, and all this found by
Office.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion was, if the Iſſue in Tayl or the King
ſhall have the Land.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:57645:5"/>
1. And it was objected, that the antient Eſtate Tayl
cannot be forfeited, becauſe it was diſcontinued, and ſuch
right of Action cannot be forfeited. As was agreed in the
Marqueſs of <hi>Wincheſters</hi> Caſe.</p>
               <p>2. The Feoffor himſelf in this Caſe had not any
right to the antient Eſtate Tayl, (it being extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by his Feoffment) and therefore by his Attaint, could
not forfeit what he had not.</p>
               <p>3. The Iſſue in Tayl in remitted to that antient right
which cannot be forfeited; And the new Eſtate Tayl de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
under the diſcontinuance, which may be forfeited
by the Statute 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. is continued, and by
Act in Law, <hi>viz.</hi> the diſcent and remitter avoided. And
the Kings Eſtate may be diveſted out of the King by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitter.
As if Tenant in Tail grant Land to the King,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the King grant the Land to the Tenant in Tail
for life, the remainder to his Son and Heirs for life: Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
for life dies, the Iſſue by and in Law is remitted,
and the Kings Eſtate is diveſted out of him. This accords
with <hi>Plow. Com.</hi> 489. <hi>Nicols</hi> Caſe.</p>
               <p>1. Reſolved that in this Caſe the Iſſue in Tail is bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
for though right of Action cannot be given to the
King, by the 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. yet when Tenant in Tail diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
his Eſtate to the uſe of himſelf in Tail, and after
is attaint of Treaſon, now by that Statute he doth not
onely forfeit the new Eſtate in Tail, but by this, the
right of the antient Eſtate is barred for ever. And ſo
note, out of the ſaid Statute, a diverſity between a naked
right of Action not forfeitable, and an Eſtate of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
forfei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which the Forfeiture of the poſſeſſion is barred by the

               <p>It was Reſolved this Term in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> That
the King had not the Emption of Tin in <hi>Cornwal</hi> by his
Prerogative; for <hi>Stanni nec plumbi fodina,</hi> &amp;c. or other
saſe Mineb, belong not to the King by his Prerogative,
but to the Subject Owner of the Land. But the Empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Tin in <hi>Cornwal</hi> belongs to the King, as an antient
Right and Inheritance: for though now a Reaſon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
eaſily be rendred of things done time out of mind;
yet it may well be, that all the Land in that County was
the King Demeſne; and upon Grant of the Land, the
King reſerved the Mines to himſelf. Theſe Tin Mines
being of great Antiquity; as appears, <hi>Ex Diodoro Siculo,
Et certo certius eſt.</hi> That all the Land in <hi>England,</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
mediately or immediately from the Crown; and
therefore ſuch a Profit may have a reaſonable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement;

               <p>All the Juſtices, viz. <hi>Popham</hi> Chief Juſtice of <hi>England,
Coke,</hi> Chief Juſtice of the Common Pleas. <hi>Fleming,</hi> Chief
Baron. <hi>Fenner, Searle, Yelverton, Williams</hi> and <hi>Tanfield.</hi>
Juſtices met at Sergeants Inne, to conſult what Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
the King had in digging and taking of Saltpeter to
make, Gunpowder by the Law. And upon conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them, theſe points were reſolved by them all,
<hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> voce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. That in as much as Gunpowder concerns the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of the Realm, and inſomuch as Saltpeter (whereof
Gunpowder is made) is within the Realm: the King
ſhall not be driven to buy it, but may take it according to
the Limitations following.</p>
               <p>2. That, though the King cannot take the Trees of his
Subject growing upon his Freehold; nor Gravel in the
Inheritance of his Subject for reparation of his houſes:
as 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 28. Yet 'tis reſolved, that he may dig for
Saltpeter, becauſe the Kings Miniſters who dig for the
ſame, are bound to leave the Inheritance of the Subject,
in as good plight as they found it, which they could not
do, if they ſhould cut the Timber growing, which would
be to the Subjects diſinheriſon.</p>
               <p>The Caſe of Gravel for reparation of the Kings Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
may not be compared to this: for Saltpeter extends
to the defence of the whole Realm, not ſo the reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on of the Kings Houſes, 13 <hi>H.</hi> 4. The King may charge
for Murage of a Town: And ſo for Portage; but not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57645:8"/>
for making a Wall about his own Houſe: When Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
invade the Realm, it is lawful to come upon any
Land adjoyning to the invaded Coaſt, to make Trenches
or Bulworks, 8 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 23. And in ſuch Caſes they may
dig for Gravel. 3 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>fo.</hi> 15. And in this Caſe the Rule
is true: <hi>Princeps et republica ex juſta cauſa poſſunt rem
mean auferre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Reſolved, That the taking of Saltpeter is a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance
of it, for the making of Gunpowder, for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
defence of the Realm. And therefore is an inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
inſeparable from the Crown, and ought to be taken
onely by the Kings Miniſters, and not converted to any
other uſe then the defence of the Realm: And 'tis not
like Silver or Gold Mines; for there the King hath In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in the Mettall, and may dig, <hi>Quia quando lex ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cui
concedit aliquid, Concedere videtur id ſine quo res ipſa
eſſe non poteſt: Vide: Plow. Com. in le Caſe de Mynes:</hi> ſo
the King may dig for Treaſure <hi>Trove eadem ratione.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. The Miniſters of the King cannot undermine,
weaken, or impair any the Walls of Foundations of any
Houſes or Buildings whatſoever. Nor dig in the Flore
of a Manſion-houſe, which ſerves for the Habitation of a
man: becauſe it is his place of refuge and defence.</p>
               <p>There are two notable Preſidents: that the King by
his Prerogative, had power to prohibit Depopulation,
and provide for Habitation.</p>

                  <hi>The other</hi> An. 21. R. 2. in dorſo claus. par. 1. N. 15.</p>
               <p>Neither may the Kings Miniſters dig in any Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floore
uſed for Corn, Hay, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but they may dig in the
floores of Stables and Oxehouſes, ſo that they leave
room for the Horſes and other Cattel of the Owner, and
put it in convenient time into as good plight as they
found it. Alſo they may dig in Cellars and Vaults: and
and Mud-walls, being not Walls of a Manſion-houſe, and
in the ruines and decayes of any Houſes or Buildings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:57645:9"/>
5. They ought to make the places where they dig, as
commodious to the Owner as before.</p>
               <p>6. They may work in the poſſeſſion of the Subject, but
betwixt Sun-riſing, and Sun ſetting.</p>
               <p>7. They may not place any Furnace or other Veſſels
in any Subjects Houſe, without conſent, nor ſo near it,
as to prejudice the ſame.</p>
               <p>8. They are not to ſtay over long in a place, nor to
return thither again in a long time.</p>
               <p>9. Reſolved, That the owner of the Land cannot be
reſtrained from digging, and making Saltpeter, for the
King hath no Intereſt in it, the property is in the owner
of the Land. Before the 31 <hi>Eliz.</hi> no King or Queen of
this Realm granted any Licence for taking Saltpeter; but
in that 31 year, there were two, the one to <hi>George Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable</hi>

<hi>Abbati de Bruera,</hi> in which the Abbot raſed out this word
<hi>Fittetrida,</hi> and inſtead of it writ <hi>eſt leigh,</hi> and upon
ſhewing it, obtained a confirmation of it from King <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.
And an allowance of it <hi>in Banco R.</hi> And for this Offence,
the Abbot was called before the King and Council in the
<hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> where the Abbot being Convict, it was
part of the Sentence, That the Charter, confirmation,
and allowance of it, ſhould be brought in to be cancelled;
where note,</p>
               <p>1. The Antiquity of the Star-Chamber being then a
Court.</p>
               <p>2. That the raſure was not any Counterfeit of the
Great Seal; for if the Offence had been High Treaſon,
it ſhould not have been determined before the King and
Council.</p>
               <p>3. That Spiritual Perſons were then puniſhable before
Temporal Judges.</p>
               <p>4. That if there be a raſure of a Deed between Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject

naught; ſo if a Patentee raſe his Heirs Patents in
a place material.</p>
               <p>Thence concluded, That if the raſing of a word in the
Kings Patent be not Treaſon, then the raſing of two or
three, or all the words of the Patent, and writing a new
Grant is not Treaſon.</p>
               <p>By the Statute of the 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. it is provided, That
becauſe many other Caſes of like Treaſon might happen
in time to come, which men cannot think or declare at
preſent. That if another Caſe ſuffered Treaſon, and
not ſpecified in the Act, ſhall come before any of the
Juſtices, they ſhall ſtay without going to Judgment of
Treaſon, untill the Caſe be ſhewen before the King in

               <p>

1. That though a Caſe happen like to the Caſes of
Treaſon mentioned in the ſaid Act; yet that the
Judges ought not to judge it Treaſon, but it ought to be
declared in Parliament.</p>
               <p>2. That when a particular Caſe was adjudged High

               </p>
               <p>Afterwards <hi>George Leake,</hi> upon Examination before
the chief Juſtice of <hi>England,</hi> made a clear Confeſſion of
of all the manner and circumſtances of the Fact as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid;
whereupon Two Queſtions were moved,</p>
               <p>1. Whether this Offence were High Treaſon or no:
And in this the Juſtices were divided; my ſelf and divers
others holding, That this Act was not Treaſon; but the

               <head>The Caſe of Foreſts.</head>
               <p>This Term it was informed to the King, that great
wrongs were done in the Foreſt of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> in the County
of <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> and in his Foreſt of <hi>Bowland,</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Warwick,</hi> parcel of his Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter.</hi> And
upon this, by Warrant from the King under his Signet,
all the Juſtices were aſſembled, to reſolve certain Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to be moved concerning Foreſts, by the Attorney of
the Dutchy, and the Councel of the other part; which
were Foreſts and Chaſes: Which being matter in Fact,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57645:12"/>
the Judges could not give their Reſolutions, but by way
of Directions. And it was Reſolved,</p>
               <p>1. That if theſe are Foreſts, it will appear by matter
of Record, as by <hi>Eyres</hi> of Juſtices of Foreſts, Swanni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes,
Regardors, &amp;c. But the calling it a Foreſt in
Grants, &amp;c. proveth it not a Foreſt in Law.</p>
               <p>2. Reſolved by all the Juſtices, That if there be no
Foreſts in Law, but Free-Chaſes; then who hath any
Free-hold in them, may cut his Wood growing upon it,
without view or Licence; leaving ſufficient for Covert to
maintain the Kings Games: ſo a common perſon ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Chace in another Soil, the Owner may not deſtroy
the Covert, nor Browſe-wood.</p>
               <p>3. Reſolved, That in ſuch a Chaſe, the Owner, by
Preſcription, may have Common for his Sheep, and War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
for his Coneys, by Grant or Preſcription: but he
muſt not ſurcharge or make Burrows in other places,
than hath been uſed from the time of which: nor may he
erect a new Warren without Charter.</p>
               <p>4. Reſolved, That who hath ſuch a Warren, may
lawfully build a Lodge upon his Inheritance, for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of his Game.</p>
               <p>5. <hi>Popham,</hi> Chief Juſtice, ſaid, That in the time of

Court of <hi>Star-Chamber;</hi> That when a Grand Inqueſt

yet no Conſpiracy lyes for him againſt the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ictors:
for they are returned by the Sheriff by Law, to
make Inquiry of Offences upon their Oath, for ſervice of
the King and Country, and are compellable to ſerve the
Law, 10 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 265. And their Indictment or Verdict
is matter of Record, and called <hi>Verum dictum,</hi> and ſhall
not be avoided by Surmiſe, and no Attaint lyes: And with
this agrees the Books in 22 <hi>Aſſiſe</hi> 77. 27 <hi>Aſs.</hi> 12.
21 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 17. 16 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 19. 47 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 17. 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 2.
<hi>F. N. B.</hi> 115. a. But otherwiſe of a Witneſs; for if he
conſpire out of the Court, and after ſwear in Court, his
Oath ſhall not excuſe his Conſpiracy before, for he is a
private perſon.</p>
               <p>2. Reſolved, That when the party indicted, is convictd
of Felony by another Jury, upon <hi>Not Guilty</hi> pleaded, there
he ſhall never have a Writ of Conſpiracy: But when he
is upon his Arraignment, <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gitimo modo acquietatus.</hi> But
in the Caſe at Bar, the Grand Jury who Indicted one
<hi>William Price,</hi> for the Murther of <hi>Hugh ap William;</hi> the
Jury, who, upon <hi>Not Guilty</hi> pleaded, convicted him, were
Charged, Indicted, and Convict in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi>
which was never ſeen before: For if the party ſhall
not have a Conſpiracy againſt the Indictors, when Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted,
<hi>a multo fortiori,</hi> when he is lawful Convict, he
ſhall neither charge the Grand Inqueſt nor Jury that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57645:13"/>
convicted him. But when a Jury acquits a Felon or
Traytor, againſt manifeſt Proof, there they may be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the <hi>Star-Chamber, ne maleficia remanerent impunita.</hi>
But if ſuch Suppoſals ſhall be admitted, after ordinary
Judicial Proceedings, it will be a means, <hi>ad detrahendos
Juratores &amp; deterrendos a ſervitio Regis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. Reſolved, That <hi>Barker</hi> who was Judge of Aſſize,
and gave Judgement upon the Verdict of Death againſt
the ſaid <hi>W. P.</hi> and the Sheriff that executed him, nor the
Juſtices of Peace that examined the offender, and the
Witneſſes for proof of the murther before the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
were not to be drawn in queſtion in the Star-Chamber
for any conſpiracy, nor ought to be charged
there with any conſpiracy, or elſewhere, when the party
indicted is convicted, or Attaint of murther or Felony.
And though ſuch perſon were acquitted, yet the Judge,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> being by Commiſſion, and of Record, and ſworn to
do Juſtice, cannot be charged for conſpiracy, for that he
openly did in Court as Judge, Juſtice of Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but
if he hath conſpired before out of Court, this is extraju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall,
but ſubordinations of Witneſſes, and falſe mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
proſecutions out of Court, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> amounts to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull
conſpiracy. And if Judicial matters of Record
(which are of ſo high a nature, that for their ſublimity,
they import verity in themſelves,) ſhould be drawn in
queſtion by partiall and ſiniſter ſuppoſall and averments
of offenders, there will never be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an end of Cauſes, but

doth as a Judge of Record, ought not to be drawn in
Queſtion in this Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Nota bene,</hi> that the ſaid matters at the Bar were not
examinable in the Star-Chamber; and therefore it was
Decreed by all the Court, That the ſaid Bill, without
any Anſwer to it by <hi>Barker,</hi> ſhall be taken off the File,
and utterly cancelled: And it was agreed, That the
Judges of the Realm ought not to be drawn into queſtion
for any ſuppoſed Corruption, which extends to the anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilating
of a Record, or tending to the ſlander of the
Juſtice of the King, except it be before the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
for they are only to make an account to God and
the King, otherwiſe this would tend to the ſubverſion of
all Juſtice, for which reaſon the Orator ſaid well, <hi>Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilandum

hereof is, the King himſelf being <hi>de jure,</hi> to deliver
Juſtice to all his Subjects; and becauſe himſelf cannot
do it to all Perſons, he delegates his Power to his Judges,
who have the Cuſtody and Guard of the Kings Oath.

               <p>The Lords of the Council at <hi>Whitehall, ſedente Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento,</hi>
demanded of <hi>Popham,</hi> chief Juſtice, and my ſelf,
upon motion of the Commons in Parliament, In what
caſes the Ordinary may examine any perſon <hi>ex Officio,</hi>
upon Oath; and upon Conſideration and View of our
Books, we anſwered the ſaid Lords at another day in the
Council Chamber.</p>
               <p>1. That the Ordinary cannot conſtrain any man to
ſwear generally to Anſwer to ſuch Interrogatories as ſhall
be adminiſtred unto them, but ought to deliver them a
Copy of the Articles in writings, that they may know
whether they ought to anſwer them by Law or no, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Courſe of the Chancery and Star-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
               <p>2. No man ſhall be examined upon the ſecret
thoughts of his Heart, or of his ſecret Opinion, but of
what he hath ſpoken or done. No Lay-man may be
examined <hi>ex officio, niſi in cauſis matrimonialibus et Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentariis,</hi>
as appears by an Ordinance of <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. Title
<hi>Prohibition, Raſtal.</hi> See alſo the <hi>Regiſter, fol.</hi> 366. the

but alſo in prejudice of the Crown and Dignity of the

10 <hi>Eliz.</hi> One <hi>Leigh,</hi> an Attorney of the Common Pleas,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57645:15"/>
was committed to the Fleet, becauſe he had been at

               <p>But if a Perſon Eccleſiaſtical be charged with any

               <head> Caſe concerning Pardons.</head>
               <p>The Law ſo regards the Weal-publike, that though
the King ſhall have the Suit ſolely in his Name for the
redreſs of it; yet by his Pardon he cannot diſcharge the
Offender, becauſe it is not onely in prejudice of the
King, but in damage of the Subjects: If a man ought to
repair a Bridge, and for default of Reparation, it fall to
decay; in this Caſe, the Suit ought to be in the King's
Name, and he is ſole Party to it, but for the benefit of his
Subjects: And if the King pardon it, yet the Offence
remains; but peradventure the Pardon ſhall diſcharge
the Fine for the time paſt. And with this agrees 37 <hi>H.</hi>

in caſe of Depopulation: for this is not onely an Offenc:
againſt the King, but againſt all the Realm; for by this
the Realm is infeebled, and therefore Depopulation and
Diminution of Subjects, is a greater Nuſance than the
hindrance of Subjects, in their good and eaſie paſſage
by any Bridge or High-way. And for this, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the King's Pardon, he ſhall be bound to re-edifie the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:57645:16"/>
Houſes of Husbandry which he depopulated; and though
for the time before the Pardon, perchance he ſhall not
be Fined, yet without doubt he ſhall for the time after:
For the Offence it ſelf cannot be pardoned, as in Caſe of
a Bridge or High-way, becauſe it is <hi>malum in ſe.</hi> But
this continues as to the Fine and Impriſonment, at all
times after the Pardon: But the Penalty inſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Caſe was, That Doctor <hi>Wooton</hi> writ to <hi>Edmunds</hi>

               <p>And it was Reſolved by the Lord Chancellor <hi>Egerton,</hi>
the two chief Juſtices, <hi>et per totam curiam,</hi> That this was

               <p>The Doctor thought this could not in any manner

Letter, which in Law is a Libell, ſhall be puniſhed
in the Star-Chamber, being an Offence to the King, and
a motive to breach of the Peace: And in the Caſe at

That in regard by the Act 10 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. all Spiritual

any Spiritual Judge for any cauſe whatſoever; And the
Reaſons ſome of their Profeſſion give to confirm it
are,</p>
               <p>1. That when the Statute of <hi>Premunire</hi> was made, the
Pope uſurped Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, though <hi>de jure</hi> it
belonged to the King: But now ſince the King as well <hi>de

               </p>

                  </gap> Statutes of
27 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 16 R. 2. &amp;c. <hi>de Premunire,</hi> are yet in force. And
all proceedings before any Eccleſiaſtical Judge, that were
in danger of <hi>Premunire</hi> before 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> are now in caſe of
<hi>Premunire</hi> after the ſaid Act, the ſaid Acts of <hi>Premunire</hi>
not being repealed by 1 Eliz.</p>
               <p>1. 2. And as to firſt and ſecond Objections, it was
anſwered, That true it is, The Crown of <hi>England</hi> hath
as well Eccleſiaſtical as Temporal Juriſdiction annex'd
to it, as appears by the Reſolution in <hi>Cawdryes</hi> Caſe from
Age to Age. And though this was <hi>de jure,</hi> yet where
the Pope became ſo Potent, he uſurped upon the Kings
Eccleſiaſtical Power in this Realm, but this was meer
Uſurpation. And therefore all the Kings of this Realm,
<hi>Totis viribus proinde,</hi> for eſtabliſhing of their Temporal
Law, by which they inherit their Crown, and by which,
&amp;c. were alwayes jealous in any part or point it ſhould
be incroached upon; And if the Eccleſiaſtical Law did
uſurp upon the Temporal, it was ſeverely puniſhed, and
the Offender judged an Enemy to the King by the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Statutes; and every one might have killed him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Statute of 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> And this is the Reaſon, the
Crown it ſelf is directed deſcendable by the Common
Law, and Treaſon againſt the Crown is puniſhed by
this Law. And therefore uſurpation by an Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57645:21"/>
Judge upon it, is ſaid to be <hi>contra Coronam et digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem
Regis:</hi> And all Prohibitions ſince 1 Eliz. do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<hi>contra Coronam et dignitatem Regiam;</hi> for as 'twas
reſolved by all the Juſtices, <hi>Paſch.</hi> 4 <hi>Jac. Regis, eſt
contra Coronam, &amp;c.</hi> when any Eccleſiaſtical Judge doth
uſurpe upon the Temporal Law, for the cauſe of the
Subject is drawn <hi>ad aliud examen,</hi> when his Cauſe is not
ended by the Common Law, whereto by Birth-right he
is inheritable.</p>
               <p>3. As to the Third, though the Court by force of
High-Commiſſion is the Court of the King, yet their
proceedings are Eccleſiaſtical: And therefore if they
uſurpe upon the Temporal Law, this is the ſame offence
which was before the Act, 10 Eliz.</p>
               <p>4. As to the Fourth, though it be a new Court, yet
the antient Statutes extend to it, in this word (<hi>Alibi</hi>) and
in <hi>H.</hi> 8. times ſeveral new Biſhopricks were erected; yet
never any queſtion, but the old Acts of <hi>Premuri</hi> did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to them. But to anſwer all Objections at once,
whereas the Act 1 Eliz. repealed the Statute 1 <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 P.
<hi>&amp; M. cap.</hi> 8. yet there is an expreſs <hi>Proviſo</hi> in the ſaid
Act 1 Eliz. That it ſhall not extend to Repeal any Clauſe
or Matter contained in the 1 <hi>et</hi> 2 P. <hi>M.</hi> which in any
ſort concerneth any matter or cauſe of <hi>Premunire,</hi> but
that all of that ſtand in force. See the ſaid two Acts,
and alſo 16 <hi>R.</hi> 2. Alſo the Act of 1 Eliz. revives the
Act 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. which makes a <hi>Premunire</hi> in a
Dean and Chapter, &amp;c. for not electing, certifying, or
admitting a Biſhop elected; by all which, it appears the
ſaid Act of 1 Eliz. never intended to take away the offence
of <hi>Premunire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But note in what Caſes a <hi>Premunire</hi> lyes, and in what
not.</p>
               <p>1. In all Cauſes, when the Cauſe originally belongs
to the Cognizance of the Eccleſiaſtical Court and Suit
is proſecuted there, as belonging to their Cognizance,
(though in truth (if rightly examined) it ought to be
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57645:22"/>
determined <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t Common Law) yet no <hi>Premunire</hi> lyes there,
but a Prohibition. As if Tythes are ſevered from the
nine parts, and are carried away; if the Parſon ſue for
the Subſtraction of theſe Tythes in the Spiritual Court,
this is not in the caſe of Premunire, <hi>Vide</hi> 10 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 2.
agreeing with this Opinion. So if a Parſon ſue for
Tythes of ſurmiſing that they were <hi>Sylvae Caduae,</hi> under
the age of 20 years, where in truth they were above;
yet a Prohibition lyeth, and no Premunire.</p>
               <p>2. But though the Cauſe originally may appertain to
the Cognizance of the Eccleſiaſtical Judge, yet if he
ſue for it in the nature of a Suit, which doth not belong
to the Eccleſiaſtical Court, but to the Common Law,
there a Premunire lyeth: As in the former Caſe, If the
Parſon after ſevering of Tythes, will in any Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Court ſue for carrying away his Tythes from the
9 parts, which Action pertains to the Common Law:
In ſuch caſe both the Actor and Judge incurr the danger
of Premunire. And ſo it was adjudged 17 <hi>H.</hi> 8. as

against a Parſon, that convened him into the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Court, and there libell'd againſt him for taking of
Ty hes which were ſever from the nine parts, and the
Parſon was condemned to be out of the protection of the

               <p>1. Becauſe the Act of the 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> doth not take away

               <p>2. Becauſe the words in the 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> are [which by
any manner of Spiritual Juriſdiction can or lawfully

extend to Crime only, and not to Caſes of Intereſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Party and Party.</p>
               <p>3. Becauſe this Juriſdiction was given to the Biſhops
by Act of Parliament, <hi>viz.</hi> 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. which is more
Temporal than Spiritual, as all of Parliament are.</p>
               <p>4. It was not the intent of the Act 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived

                  <hi>Note,</hi> It was moved to the Juſtices this Term, upon
conſideration of the Acts of 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and 18 <hi>Eliz.</hi> If
the Juſtices in <hi>Wales</hi> may be Conſtituted by Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and it was conceived they could not, but that it
ought to be by Patent, as hath been ever uſed ſince 34
H. 8. Then it was moved, If the King by force of a
Clauſe there in might do it; which Clauſe is, That the
King's moſt Royal Majeſty ſhall and may at all times
hereafter change, adde, alter, miniſh, and reform all
manner, &amp;c. And it ſeemed to divers of the Juſtices,
that this Power given to the King, determin'd by his
Death for divers Cauſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:57645:27"/>
1. Becauſe it wants theſe Words, <hi>His Succeſſors;</hi> and
to draw it in Succeſſion, by Conſtruction, would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Intention of the Maker of the Act: For they
gave this high Power of Alteration, &amp;c. of Laws, to the
King, as to his moſt Excellent Wiſdom ſhall be thought
moſt meet; which words want <hi>His Succeſſors:</hi> For they
well knew, his Wiſdom did not go in Succeſſion, ſo the
Power went not in Succeſſion: And for this that <hi>Eorum
progreſſus oſtendent multa quae ab initio provideri non poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunt:</hi>
And what enſues upon this, concerning this uniting
of <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>England</hi> none could divine. But it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Intention of the ſaid Act, to give Power to the
King and his Succeſſors for ever to alter, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>2. Power of Alteration of Laws, &amp;c. is a Point of
Confidence, concerning the Adminiſtration of Juſtice;
which the Act, by omitting of his Succeſſors, intended
to unite this Confidence to the Perſon of H. 8. and not
to extend it without Limitation of time to his Succeſſors,
1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 5. 1. 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 1. 14 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 44. All Commiſſions
concerning Adminiſtration of Juſtice, determine by the
King's Death: Not ſo, if he make a Leaſe <hi>durante bene pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cito,</hi>
or preſent one to a Church; theſe are not void by
his Death, untill revoked by his Succeſſor. And upon
Certificate of the Juſtices Opinion, That the Juſtices of
<hi>Wales</hi> cannot be Conſtituted by Commiſſion, Baron <hi>Snig</hi>
had a Patent for the Circuit of <hi>Wales,</hi> as others before
him had.</p>

their Juriſdiction, to anſwer to any matter before them:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57645:28"/>
But they ought to proceed according to Eccleſiaſticall
Law by Citation: And in the Circuit of <hi>Northampton,</hi>
when the Lord <hi>Anderſon</hi> and <hi>Glanvile</hi> were Juſtices of
Aſſize, a Purſivant was ſent by the Commiſſioners to
Arreſt the Body of a Man to appear before them; and in
reſiſtance of the Arreſt, and ſtriving among them, the
Purſivant was killed. And if this was Murther, or not,
was doubted: and it was Reſolved, that the Arreſt was
<hi>tortious,</hi> and by conſequence, that this was not Murther,
(though the killing of an Officer of Juſtice (whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
is lawful) in Execution of his Office is Murther.
But they may ſend Citation by a Puiſivant, and upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault
proceed to Excommunication, and then to have a

               <p>1. After the Suppreſſion of all Religious Houſes,
<hi>Anno</hi> 27. <hi>H.</hi> 8. in <hi>October</hi> 28. <hi>H.</hi> 8. there was an Inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

And all theſe Rebellions were between the 28. of

were Executed. And the King having effected in the 31

               </p>
               <p>Alſo it was obſerved, that at firſt the Commiſſion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
onely when one or both Parties were ſo poor, as
they were not able to proſecute at Law. Alſo they had
no power to grant Injunctions: and laſtly, their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
was a Patent under the Great Seal, and enrolled
in <hi>Chancery.</hi> And thus much was ſaid concerning the firſt
Inſtitution of the Court:</p>
               <p>2. That our Proceedings in granting Prohibitions, is
for matter juſtifiable by Law.</p>
               <p>As to this, whereas at firſt their Authority was Patent,
it is now private; for the Letters-Patent refer to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Inſtructions, which are no where of Record, <hi>Et de
non apparentibus &amp; non exiſtentibus eadam eſt ratio:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
the danger to the Subject is great; for if they loſe
their Inſtructions (which hath and may happen) all is
<hi>Coram non Judice.</hi> The ſecond Reaſon is drawn from
the contumacy of the Party, ſuppoſed to be grieved by
the Prohibition, and againſt whom it is granted: for if
the Authority of the Councel be never ſo good, yet being
a late Juriſdiction, the Party muſt of neceſſity plead it,
ſo as it may appear judicially; for as we are Judges of
Record, ſo muſt we be informed of Record: And no
party prohibited, ever yet moved in Court to have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation,
by which might be ſet forth the Juriſdiction
of that Court and Councel; ſo as the granting of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions
hath been juſt. The third Reaſon is drawn
from the great Injury offered to the Defendants, for it
is a true Rule, <hi>Miſera ſervitus ubi jus eſt vagum aut in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certum.</hi>
The Defendants by Law may in all Courts plead
to the Juriſdiction of the Court: but how can they do
ſo, when no man can poſſibly know what Juriſdiction they
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57645:30"/>
have: And the keeping of them in ſuch Secrecy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrayeth
that the Councel are afraid, that they would not
be juſtified if they were known.</p>
               <p>3. That the manner of our Proceedings was reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:
for a Jury of Officers and Attorneys of our Court
being according to an antient Cuſtome, time out of
mind uſed, ſworn to preſent, among other things, all
Defaults of Officers and Miniſters, in not executing the
Proceſs of this Cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t, and all Impediments of the due
Proceedings thereof: And finding upon their Oaths,
divers unjuſt Impediments of the ſaid Proceedings by the
ſaid Councel in particular, thereupon a motion being
made in open Court in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term laſt, by the
King's Serjeant <hi>Philips,</hi> of many Grievances done there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
prayed the Court, according to Law and Juſtice, to
grant ſeveral Prohibitions, in all thoſe ſeveral Cauſes,
which we could not deny. Yet firſt we conferred with Sir
<hi>Cuthbert Pepper,</hi> Attorney of the Wards, and one of that
Councel, to let him underſtand the part<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who, upon Motion, came to us to Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>geants Inne,
with whom we conferred, who would not take upon him
to juſtifie the ſame in no ſort, but ſaid he would acquaint
the Preſident and Councel therewith, and return their
Anſwer. Which for that it was neglected, upon further
Motion in Court, we granted Prohibition, as in Juſtice
we ought.</p>
               <p>4. Now to anſwer all Objections: And firſt, where
it was objected, more Prohibitions had been granted of
late, than in many years before: To this a Sixfold An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
was made.</p>
               <p>1. That they had exceedingly multiplyed the number
of Cauſes; they in five Counties, and three Towns, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
at one ſitting 450 Cauſes at Hearing: whereas the
<hi>Chancery</hi> that extends into all <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> had in
<hi>Eaſter</hi> Term, but 95. and in <hi>Trinity</hi> Term but 72. to be
heard. So that it is no wonder, it in ſuch a Multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Cauſes, the number of Prohibitions be increaſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:57645:30"/>
2. Beſides the Multiplication they have innovated and
taken upon them, to deal in Cauſes which we know ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

reſpect as well of the Multiplications of Suits, as Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of others, it may very well be, that more Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> have been granted of late, than in

more antient than is ſuppoſed: For which, ſee <hi>Mich.</hi> 7

               </p>
               <p>3. The Judges never grant either Prohibition, or <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beas
Corpus,</hi> but upon Motion or Complaint by the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
grieved; and therefore as the Subject hath more cauſe
to complain, there muſt needs be more Prohibitions, and
<hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> than heretofore.</p>
               <p>4. The Proceedings there are by abſolute Power, and
their Decrees uncontrollable and finall, more than in a
Judgment in a Writ of Right, which makes them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
too much upon their Authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:57645:31"/>
5. Theſe Suits grow more prejudicial to the King
than ever, becauſe thereby the King loſeth his Fines,

               <p>6. Remedy for the time paſt; if the Common-Bench
erre, Writ of Errour lies in <hi>Banco Regis;</hi> if the Kings-Bench
erre, a Writ of Errour lyes in the Upper-Houſe of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>7. For the time to come: 1. That the Inſtructions
be inrolled in <hi>Chancery,</hi> that the Subject may ſee and
know their Juriſdiction. 2. That the Preſidents and
Councels, have ſome Councel Learned in the Court, to
inform us judicially of their true Juriſdiction, and we will
give them a day to ſhew cauſe, that Juſtice may be done
on both ſides; and if we erre, the Law hath provided a
Remedy by Writ of Errour: And we are ſworn to do
Juſtice to all, according to the Laws.</p>
               <p>Upon this Anſwer of the Judges, the Lords of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
upon Conference among themſelves, gave (by the
Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> then Lord Treaſurer) this Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>1. That the Inſtructions ſhould be Recorded, as far as
they concerned Criminal Cauſes, or Cauſes between
Party and Party: But as to State-Matters, not to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.</p>
               <p>2. That both Councels ſhould be within the Survey

               </p>
               <p>3. The Motion was well allowed, that the Preſidents

               <p>And concerning the remoteneſſe of the place, the

               <p>In <hi>Langdales</hi> Caſe this Term, in a Prohibition to the
High Commiſſioners, two Points were moved: 1. If
a <hi>Feme Covert</hi> may ſue for Alimony before the High-Commiſſioners.
2. If the Court of Common Pleas
may grant a Prohibition when there is no Plea pendant
there: This concerning the Juriſdiction of the Court was
firſt debated, and divers Objections were made againſt
it.</p>
               <p>1. That this Court hath not Juriſdiction to hold Plea,
without an Original, unleſs by Priviledge of an Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57645:32"/>
Officer, or Clerk of the Court, and unleſs it be in
a ſpecial Caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> when there is an Action there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
for the ſame Cauſe; then it was agreed, that
a Prohibition ought to recite, <hi>Quod cum tale Placitum
pendet, &amp;c.</hi> And it was ſaid, That <hi>F. N. B.</hi> 43. <hi>g.</hi> agrees
with this. But a man ought to have his Prohibition out
of <hi>Chancery,</hi> or the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> upon ſurmiſe that he is
ſued in <hi>Court Chriſtian</hi> for a Temporal Cauſe, and the
2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 11. 6. was cited.</p>
               <p>To this it was anſwered and <hi>Reſolved</hi> by <hi>Coke,</hi> chief
Juſtice, <hi>Warberton, Daniell,</hi> and <hi>Foſter,</hi> Juſtices, That the
Common Pleas may award a Prohibition, though no
Suit be there pendent; for it is the principal Court of
Common Law for Common Pleas, <hi>Quia Communia Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cita
non ſequantur Curiam noſtram,</hi> as it is Enacted by
<hi>Magna Charta,</hi> thirty times confirmed by Parliam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>;
then if the Eccleſiaſtical Judges incroach upon the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Common Pleas, there the Court ſhall
Grant a Prohibition, and that without Original Writ,
for divers Cauſes:</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe no Original Writ iſſuing out of Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is retornable into the King Bench or Common Pleas,
but is directed to a Judge, or Party, or both, and is not
retornable. And upon contempt of the Prohibition, the
Chancellor may award an Attachment, retornable either
in the Kings Bench, or Common Pleas, which in ſuch
caſe is but a Judicial Writ. And if ſuch Attachment be
retornable in the Common Pleas, &amp;c. the Plaintiff in
the Declaration ſhall make mention of an Original in
Chancery, and of the contempt, &amp;c. as appears in a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Preſident.</p>
               <p>2. There was great reaſon that no Original Writ
of Prohibition ſhall be retornable, for the Common-Law
was a Prohibition in it ſelf, and incroachment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it incurred a contempt, and with this agrees our
Books, 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 56. And there 'tis held, That the Statute
of the 45 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. and the Common Law alſo was a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57645:33"/>
in it ſelf: and thus the Rule of the Book, 19 <hi>H.</hi>

That if a Plea be held in <hi>Court-Chriſtian,</hi> which belongs
to the Court of the King, without a Prohibition <hi>in facto,</hi>
the Plaintiff ſhall have an Attachment upon a Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;

112. A Conſultation is as much an Original, as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition:
And the Court hath granted a Conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>ergo</hi> Prohibitions. <hi>Qui habet jurisdictionem abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendi,
habet juris dictionem Ligandi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are ſeveral ſorts of Prohibitions; one ſort with
this word, <hi>Probibemus vobis,</hi> and Letters in nature thereof,
as <hi>Superſedeas.</hi> And Injunction is a Prohibition; and
Prohibition of Waſt out of <hi>Chancery</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Expreſs Prohibition are in two manners; the one,
founded upon a Suggeſtion; the other, upon Record:
Upon Suggeſtion, where Plea is pendent, and yet the Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion
is the Foundation; but it is founded upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
where no Plea is pendent: for Prohibitions found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon Record, <hi>Ne admittas,</hi> ought to recite the Plea
pendent. So a Writ to the Biſhop, to admit a Clerk, is
a Judicial <hi>Latitat,</hi> as <hi>Dyer</hi> defends it. As to the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of a Plea, or not pendency, it is not material for
divers cauſes.</p>
               <p>1. The pendency of the Plea may give a priviledge to
the party, but no Juriſdiction to the Court in a Collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Suit; between which there is great diverſity.</p>
               <p>2. The Prohibition, where Plea is pendent, is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
Judicial upon Record, for it is a Collateral Suit.</p>

King, upon Complaint made by <hi>Bancroft,</hi> Arch-Biſhop

That when Queſtion was made of what matters

Caſe in which there is not expreſs Authority in Law,
the King himſelf may decide in his Royal Perſon, the
Judges being but his Delegates, &amp;c. And the Arch-Biſhop
ſaid this was clear in Divinity. To which it
was anſwered by <hi>Mee,</hi> in the preſence, and with the clear
Conſent of all the Juſtices of <hi>England,</hi> and Barons of the
Exchequer, that the King in his own perſon cannot ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge
any Caſe either Criminal, as Treaſon, &amp;c. or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
party and party, concerning Inheritance, Goods,
&amp;c. But it ought to be determined in ſome Court of
Juſtice, according to the Law and Cuſtome of <hi>England,</hi>
and all Judgments are given <hi>Ideo conſideratum eſt per Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium.</hi>
And the King hath his Court in the Upper Houſe

Judge over all Judges. And in this reſpect, the

that the King may ſit in the <hi>Star-Chamber;</hi> but this was

out of any of his Courts, and give Judgment upon it; but
in his own Cauſe he may ſtay it, as appears 11 H. 4. 8.
And the Judges informed the King, that no King after

<hi>Fuller</hi> further ſaid, That though he had alledged theſe
matters were determinable at Common Law, yet they
gave Sentence: The Defendants to have a Conſultation
pleaded, That <hi>Fuller</hi> proved the delivery of the Deed
by <hi>Clere</hi> and <hi>Mouſe,</hi> but could not prove <hi>Livery and
Seiſin</hi> according to the Deed; and that therefore Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
was given without that, that the Judges would not
admit the proof without other Witneſſes; upon this
<hi>Fuller</hi> demurred, and his Council objected.</p>
               <p>1. That <hi>Wiskard</hi> pleads matter determinable meerly at
Common Law, <hi>viz</hi> Letters Patents, &amp;c. and on the
other part <hi>Fuller</hi> Claims an Eſtate in the Rectory, by
conveyance at Common Law: And the Queſtion in the
Court Eccleſiaſtical being? Who hath the beſt Eſtate in
the Rectory; this ought to be tryed by the Common
Law, for this is the Birth-right of the Subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:57645:37"/>
2. It was Objected, That all matters in Law ought
to be determined by the Judges of the Law: And in this
Caſe matters of Law ariſing, as if a Rectory be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by Deed with all Tythes, &amp;c. and no Livery is made.
If the Tythes may paſs with any Livery; this is a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be decided by the Judges of the Common Law:
<hi>Quod quiſque novit in hoc ſe exerceat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. It was objected, That <hi>Wiskard</hi> was a meer ſtranger
to the Suit, and all his Allegation is Temporal; and
for that it is a ſtronger Caſe to maintain a Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>4. It was Objected, That <hi>Fuller</hi> had but one Witneſs to
prove the delivery of the Deed, and in the Eccleſiaſticall
Law <hi>Unus Teſtis et nullus Teſtis,</hi> for which cauſes it was
prayed the Prohibition might ſtand.</p>
               <p>To which it was anſwered by Sir <hi>Chriſtopher Wray,</hi> chief
Juſtice, <hi>Et per totam Curiam,</hi> to the firſt Objection,
That;</p>
               <p>1. Where the original belongs to the Eccleſiaſtical
Court, the determination of all that depends on it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to the ſame Court, though the matter be tryable at
Law; but where the Original matter belongs to the
Common Law, and there commenced, and iſſue taken
upon matter tryable by the Eccleſiaſtical Law, there the
Judges of our Law ſhall write to the Judges of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical

Anceſtral, if Baſtardy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be pleaded in the Demandant,
and upon this Iſſue is joyned, this ſhall be tryed by the

Conſultation with men learned in the Law, they
give Sentence according to Law; this is well done, and
no Prohibition ought to granted: but if they draw the
intereſt of any man <hi>ad alîud examen,</hi> there Prohibition
lyes. And in the Caſe at the Barr, they well reſolved
the Law; for by the ſaid Livery of the Charter, the
Tythes do not paſs as in groſs, becauſe the intention of
Parties was to paſs the entire Rectory by the Feoffment,
and to paſs the Tythes, and ſo diſmember the Recto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>3. As to the third, <hi>Reſolved,</hi> That by the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal

when they have Juriſdiction of the Original cauſe of

               <p>4. As to the fourth, <hi>Reſolved,</hi> That ſuch a ſurmiſe,
That he hath but one Witneſs, is not ſufficient to have a

Prohibition, becauſe the Court Eccleſiaſtical hath ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction

               <p>It was <hi>Reſolved</hi> upon Evidence, by <hi>Coke,</hi> chief Juſtice,

               <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 20th. of <hi>Sept.</hi> 8 <hi>Regis Jacobi,</hi> I was
ſent for to attend the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer,
Lord Privy-Seal, and Chancellor of the Dutchy;
the Attorney, Sollicitor, and Recorder being preſent.
And two Queſtions were moved to me by the Lord Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer;</p>
               <p>1. If the King by his Proclamation may prohibite
new Buildings in and about <hi>London?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. If the King may prohibite the making of Starch of
Wheat?</p>
               <p>The Treaſurer ſaid, Theſe were preferred to the King
as Grievances, and againſt the Law and Juſtice; To
which the King Anſwered; That he will conferr with his
Privy-Council and Judges, and then he will do them
right. To which I anſwered, That theſe Queſtions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of great Importance, I did deſire, that I might have
Conference with my Brethren the Judges; To which
the Chancellor ſaid, Every Preſident had firſt a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement,
and that he would adviſe the Judges to
maintain the Kings Prerogative, and where there was no
Preſident, to leave it to the King; and all concluded it

ſhould be neceſſary to confirm the Kings Prerogative
with our Opinions.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwered, True it is, every Preſident hath
a Commencement, but when Authority and Preſident is
wanting, there needs great Conſiderations before any
Novelty be eſtabliſhed; For I ſaid, The King cannot
change any part of the Common-Law, nor create any
offence by his Proclamation: But I deſired to Confer
with my Brethren, for <hi>Deliberandum eſt diu, quod Statu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endum

               <p>It is to be underſtood, That the Juriſdiction of the

of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third. But without queſtion, the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Admiralty is more antient; for I find a
notable Book in the time of <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. Title <hi>Avowry,</hi> 192.
which proves it more antient than Mr. <hi>Lambert</hi> ſpeaks:
The Caſe was, <hi>One brought a Replevin of his Ship taken on
the Coaſt of</hi> Scarbrough <hi>upon the Sea, and carryed into</hi>
Norfolk, <hi>and there detained; the plaint of taking in the

That the Peace be kept as well upon the Sea as the Land-And
we find, that you come by due Proceſs, and we ſee
nothing why you ought not to anſwer; upon which Book
I obſerve five things:</p>
               <p>1. That of things done upon the Sea, Judgment is
given to Mariners, <hi>id eſt,</hi> to Admirals, as ſhall appear,
and belongeth not to the King's Court, becauſe no <hi>Paiis</hi>
may be taken there; for where the <hi>Paiis</hi> or Jury may
come, the Admiral hath no Juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>2. This proves directly, That there the Admiral hath
Juriſdiction to adjudge things done upon the Sea, from
whence no <hi>Paiis</hi> may come. And this did nor begin then,
for queſtionleſs ever ſince there was Trade or Traffick
(which is the Life of every Iſland) there was Marine
Juriſdiction, to redreſſe Depraedations, Piracies, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and other Offences upon the Sea.</p>
               <p>3. The third thing is, That if part of the matter be

Commiſſion in Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical was publiſhed in

with the Chief Juſtice, Chief Baron, Juſtice <hi>VVilliams,</hi>

divers Biſhops, Attorney and Sollicitor, and divers Deans
and Doctors in the Cannon and Civil Laws: And I was
commanded to ſit by force of the ſaid Commiſſion, which
I refuſed for three Cauſes.</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe neither I nor any of my Brethren of the
Common-Pleas, were acquainted with it.</p>
               <p>2. Becauſe I did not know what was contained in the
new Commiſſion; and no Judge can execute any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
with a good Conſcience, without knowledg; for
<hi>Tantum ſibi eſt permiſſum, quantum eſt Commiſſum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. That there was not any neceſſity of my ſitting, who
underſtood nothing of it, ſo long as the other Judges,
whoſe adviſe had been had in this new Commiſſion, were
there.</p>
               <p>4. That I have endeavoured to inform my ſelf of it,
by a Copy from the Rolls, but it was not enrolled.</p>
               <p>5. None can ſit by force of any Commiſſion, till he
hath taken the Oath of Supremacy according to 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi>
and if I may hear the Commiſſion read, and have a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
to adviſe upon, I will either ſit, or ſhew cauſe to the
contrary. The Lord Treaſurer perſwaded me to ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, but
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57645:49"/>
I utterly refuſed it, and the reſt ſeemed to incline. Then
the Commiſſion was openly read, containing divers
Points againſt the Laws and Statutes of <hi>England:</hi> At
hearing of which, all the Judges rejoyced they ſate not
by it. Then the Archbiſhop made an Oration; during
all which, as the reading of the Commiſſion, I ſtood, and
would not ſit; and ſo by my Example, did the reſt of the
Judges. And ſo the Archbiſhop appointed the great
Chamber at <hi>Lambeth</hi> in Winter, and the Hall in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
and every <hi>Thurſday</hi> in the Term at two a clock Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,

were ſealed 16 of <hi>Feb.</hi> 7 <hi>Jac.</hi> And for the performance
of the ſaid Articles, Sir <hi>James</hi> gave Bond of 8000 <hi>l.</hi> to

Sir <hi>James</hi> procures <hi>Mary Rice,</hi> the Widow of the ſaid <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam

Accuſation aforeſaid: Which Petition, the King refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to the Chief Juſtice of the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> who, after
full Examination, certified the King, that he found a falſe
Conſpiracy, to indict Sir <hi>Anthony,</hi> without any juſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57645:50"/>
ground, and certified alſo the effect of the Articles: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the King, by Advice of the Privy-Councel,
thought the matter fit to be ſentenced in the <hi>Star-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;</hi>
Which in the ſame Term, upon ordinary proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
was heard by ſix dayes: And it was objected by
the Defendants Councel, That the Bill, upon the ſaid
Conſpiracy, did not lye; and that it would be dangerous
to maintain it; for it will deter men to proſecute againſt
great Offenders, whereby they will paſs unpuniſhed: And
by the Law, Conſpiracy lyes where a man is indicted, and
<hi>legitimo modo acquietus;</hi> but here he was never indicted,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>But to this, it was Anſwered, and Reſolved, by the
Lord Chancellor, the two Chief Juſtices, and all the
Court, That in this Caſe, the Bill was maintainable,
though the Party accuſed was not indicted and acquitted
before, as it was Reſolved in this Court, <hi>Hill.</hi> 8. <hi>Jac.</hi> in
<hi>Poulter</hi>'s Caſe. Beſides, be Sir <hi>Anthony</hi> guilty or no, the
Defendants are puniſhable, for promiſing Bribes and
Rewards to <hi>Smith,</hi> to accuſe the Plaintiff, and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
to ſhare Sir <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>thonies</hi> Eſtate after Attainder: And
there is a great Indignity offered to the King, in aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to Covenant, that the King ſhall protect or pardon,
or that any man's Eſtate may be ſhared before Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>And it appeared by many Witneſſes, that <hi>William Rice</hi>
dyed not of any poyſoning, but of a horrible Diſeaſe got
by his diſſolute life, which with Reverence cannot be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</p>
               <p>And in this Caſe, it was Reſolved, That if Felony be
done, and one hath ſuſpition upon probable matter, that
another is guilty of it, he may arreſt the party ſo ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to bring him to Juſtice. But in this Caſe, three things
are to be obſerved:</p>
               <p>1. That a Felony be done.</p>
               <p>2. That he that doth arreſt, hath ſuſpition upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:57645:51"/>
3. That he himſelf, who hath the ſuſpition, arreſt the
party.</p>
               <p>Reſolved alſo, That if Felony be done, and common
fame and noiſe is, that one hath committed it, this is
good cauſe for him that knowes of it to arreſt the party:
and with this agrees the Book, 2 H. 5. 15, 16. 15 H. 7.

               <head>Counteſs of Shrewsbury's Caſe.</head>
               <p>In this Term, before a ſelect Councel at <hi>York</hi>-houſe,
the Counteſs of <hi>Shrewsbury</hi> (Wife of <hi>Gilbert</hi> Earl of
<hi>Shrewsbury</hi>) then Priſoner in the Tower, was brought, and
by the Kings Attorney and Sollicitor was charged with
a high Contempt of dangerous conſequence; declaring,
That the Lady <hi>Arbella,</hi> being of the Blood-Royal, had
marryed <hi>Seymor,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Hertford's</hi> ſecond Son, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the King's Conſent, for which he was committed to
the Tower, and had eſcaped and fled beyond the Seas. And
the Lady <hi>Arbella</hi> being under reſtraint eſcaped alſo, and
embarked her ſelf on the Sea, but was taken ere ſhe got o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
of which flight of the Lady <hi>Arbella,</hi> the ſaid Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs
well knew, as is directly proved by <hi>Crompton,</hi> and
not denied by the Lady <hi>Arbella.</hi> And admitting the Lady
<hi>Arbella</hi> had no evil intent againſt the King; yet when
ſhe fled, and ſhould be inviron'd with Evil Spirits, <hi>cum
perverſis perverti poſſit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Charge was in two Parts:</p>
               <p>1. That the Counteſs of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi> being by the
King's Command called to the Councel-Table, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
required by the Lords, to declare her knowledge
touching the ſaid Points; ſhe anſwered, ſhe would not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
particularly; and being again by the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
asked by the Councel at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> ſhe refuſed for
two Cauſes:</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe ſhe had made a Vow, that ſhe would not
declare any thing in particular touching the ſaid Points;
and (ſhe ſaid) it was better to obey God, than Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:57645:52"/>
2. She ſtood upon her Priviledge of Nobility, <hi>viz.</hi> to
anſwer, when Judicially called before her Peers: ſuch
Priviledge having been allowed to <hi>William</hi> Earl of <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke,</hi>
and the Lord <hi>Lumly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. The ſecond Point of the Charge was, That when
the Anſwer ſhe had made was put in Writing, and read
to her, yet ſhe refuſed to ſubſcribe the ſame: Which
Denial was urged by the King's Councel, as a high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
&amp;c. And the Counteſs hearing the Charge, yet
perſiſted in her obſtinate Refuſal, for the ſame Reaſons
the inſiſted on as before: And the Lord Chancellor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
and the Archbiſhop and the other Lords adjudged it
a great and high Contempt: And that no ſuch allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
was to the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> or Lord <hi>Lumly,</hi> as was
ſuppoſed. And the Archbiſhop, and Earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi>
proved by Scripture, that the ſaid Caſe now was againſt
the Law of God.</p>
               <p>All that the Juſtices ſaid was, That they might well
be ſilent; but that <hi>ſilentium in Senatu eſt vitium:</hi> and
therefore they briefly ſpeak of three things:</p>
               <p>1. Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ther the Refuſals aforeſaid were Offences in
Law, againſt the King, his Crown, and Dignity.</p>
               <p>2. What Proceeding this is; and if juſtifiable by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
or Reaſon.</p>
               <p>3. What the Offences are, and how puniſhable.</p>
               <p>1. As to the firſt: It was reſolved by the Juſtices, and
Maſter of the Rolls, that the denying to be examined,
was a high Contempt againſt the King, his Crown, and
Dignity: and upon hope of Impunity, it will be an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to Offenders, as <hi>Fleming</hi> Chief Juſtice ſaid,
to enterprize dangerous Attempts.</p>
               <p>The Maſter of the Rolls ſaid, the Nobility in this
Caſe, had no more priviledge to deny to be examined,
than any other Subject.</p>
               <p>Alſo, if one Noble be ſued, and a Peer be ſued in
<hi>Star-Chamber</hi> or <hi>Chancery,</hi> they muſt anſwer upon their
Oaths: And if produced as a Witneſs, they ought to be
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57645:52"/>
ſworn: And therefore for maintaining of Order, the
Chief Juſtice ſaid he would recite ſome of thoſe Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Priviledges, which the Law of <hi>England</hi> attributes to
Nobility.</p>
               <p>1. If a Baron Viſcount, Earl, &amp;c. be Plaintiff in
any Action, and the Defendant will plead, that the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff
is not a Baron, &amp;c. this ſhall be tryed onely by the
Record in <hi>Chancery,</hi> which imports by its ſelf ſolid
truth.</p>
               <p>2. Their Perſons have many Priviledges in Law.</p>
               <p>1. At a Subjects Suit they ſhall not be arreſted.</p>
               <p>2. Their Bodies are not ſubject to Torture, <hi>in cauſa
criminis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aeſae Majeſtatis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. They are not to be ſworn in Aſſiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s, Juries, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts.</p>
               <p>4. It is Felony in any Servant of the King, named in
the <hi>Checquer</hi> Roll, to compaſs or intend to kill any Lord
of Parliament, or of the King's Councel.</p>
               <p>5. In the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> a Lord ſhall have Knights
returned of his Jury.</p>
               <p>6. He ſhall have Day of Grace.</p>
               <p>7. Shall not be Tryed in caſe of Treaſon, Felony, or
Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>priſon of them, but by thoſe that are Nobles and
Peers.</p>
               <p>8. In Tryal of a Peer, the Lords of Parliament ſhall
not ſwear, but give their Judgment, <hi>Super Fidem &amp; Lige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antiam
Domino Regi debitam.</hi> And the King honours with
Nobility for two Cauſes.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Ad conſulendum;</hi> and therefore he gives them a
Robe.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>Ad Defendendum Regem &amp; Regnum;</hi> and therefore
he gives them a Sword.</p>
               <p>And therefore, as they derive their Dignities with
thoſe Honourable Priviledges from the King; to deny
to anſwer, being required by the King, is a high Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
accompanied with great Ingratitude.</p>
               <p>This Denial is <hi>contra Ligeantiam ſuam,</hi> as appears by
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57645:53"/>
the Antient Oath of Allegeance: And the Law hath
greater account to a Noble-mans Allegeance, then one of
the Commons, becauſe the breach of their Allegeance
is more dangerous; for <hi>Corruptio optimorum eſt peſſima.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. As to the ſecond Point, <hi>viz.</hi> concerning the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Proceedings.</p>
               <p>1. Privative: It is not to fine, impriſon, or inflict cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
puniſhment; for that ought to be aſſeſſed in ſome
Court Judicially.</p>
               <p>2. Poſitive: The Fine is <hi>ad monendum;</hi> or at moſt,
<hi>ad minandum:</hi> it is, <hi>ad inſtruendum non ad deſtruendum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This ſelected Councel, is to expreſs what puniſhment
this Offence juſtly deſerved, if judicially proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
in the <hi>Star-Chamber:</hi> Therefore this Proceeding
is out of the King's Mercy to this Lady; that ſeeing
her Offence, ſhe might ſubmit to the King, without any
Judicial Proceedings againſt her. And though the Law
puts Limits to the King's Juſtice, it doth not ſo to his
Mercy: <hi>Et ideo proceſſus iſte eſt regalis plane &amp; rege dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi>
And this manner of Proceeding, is fortified by the
Preſident of the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> againſt whom ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
were in this very place, 42 <hi>&amp;</hi> 43 <hi>Eliz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the laſt Point, It was reſolved by all, <hi>quaſi una
voce,</hi> that if a Sentence ſhould be given in the <hi>Star Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi>
ſhe ſhould be fined 20000 <hi>l.</hi> and impriſoned during
the Kings pleaſure.</p>

               <head> Robert Scarlet's Caſe.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That at the Seſſions of Peace lately holden at
<hi>Woodbridge</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> the Sheriff returned a Grand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
of which one <hi>Robert Scarlet</hi> deſired to be one: But
the Sheriff knowing the malice of the man, refuſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
him: Yet by Confederacy with the Clark, who
read the Pannel, he was ſworn of the Grand Inqueſt; and
being amongſt them of the Grand Inqueſt (though not
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57645:53"/>
returned) as one of them, of his malice, and upon his
own knowledge, as he pretended, indicted 17 honeſt men
upon divers penal Laws: Some of the Juſtices looking
over the Bills, and ſeeing ſo many honeſt men indicted, as
they ſuppoſed, malitiouſly, demanded what Evidence they
had to find the ſaid Bills; and they anſwered, By the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
and Cognizance of one of themſelves, <hi>viz. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Scarlet:</hi> And upon Examination it appeared, that
the ſaid <hi>Robert Scarlet</hi> was not returned, but had procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
himſelf to be ſworn by Confederacy, as aforeſaid: For
which Offence, he was indicted at the Summer Aſſizes
following, 10 <hi>J c.</hi> held at <hi>Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

4. <hi>c.</hi> 9. And he pleaded not guilty: All the eſpeciall
Matter aforeſaid being proved, he was found guilty by a
ſubſtantial Jury. And in this Caſe, divers Points were
conſidered;</p>
               <p>1. Whether Juſtices of Aſſize have power to puniſh
this offence or no? And it was held affirmatively, <hi>ſcil.</hi> by
force of their Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer.</hi> And if the
Act be indefinite, or general, and doth not give Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to any Courts in ſpecial, the general words of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer</hi> extends to it.</p>
               <p>

Courts of Record, are reſtrained to the four ordinary
Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> is not held for Law; as the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute

to be recovered in any Court of Record: And Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

<hi>Terminer,</hi> have always enquired thereof: So the 33 <hi>H.</hi> 8.

               <p>2. The ſecond conſideration was upon the Statute,
11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. and it was held, that <hi>Robert Scarlet</hi> was
an Offender within that Statute; becauſe knowing he
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57645:54"/>
was not returned of the Grand Inqueſt, procured himſelf,
by falſe Conſpiracy, to be ſworn as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>3. The third Conſideration was had of 3 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 10.
which alters the Act of the 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. in part, as to deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination:
But in regard, that ſtill by that Act none can

And for this the Act 3 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 10. hath not altered the Law,
as to the Offence of <hi>Robert Scarlet.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>2. Great Inconveniencies follow, where there is great
State and Dignity, and no means to maintain it.</p>
               <p>3. It is good reaſon to take away ſuch Dignity by Act
of Parliament; and then the Act ſhall be expounded, to
take away ſuch Inconvenience. And though the Earl of
<hi>Shrewsbury</hi> be of great Honour, Vertue, and Poſſeſſions in
<hi>England;</hi> yet it was not the Intention of the Act to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
him Earl in <hi>Ireland,</hi> when his Poſſeſſions there were
taken away.</p>

               <head> Parliament in Ireland.</head>
               <p>The Lords of the Councel did write to the two Chief
Juſtices, and Chief Baron, to look into <hi>Poynings</hi> Act made
10 H. 7. in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and to conſider thereof, and certifie
what ſhall be fit to be held concerning the ſame; their
Letter bore date, <hi>Ultimo Janii</hi> 1612. Upon which, in
this Term, the ſaid Chief Juſtices, Chief Baron, Attorney
and Sollicitor General, were aſſembled two days at Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geants
Inne: And they conſidered not onely of the ſaid
Act 10 H. 7. <hi>c.</hi> 4. called <hi>Poynings</hi> Act; but alſo of an Act
made in <hi>Ireland,</hi> 3 &amp; 4 <hi>P.</hi> &amp; <hi>M. c.</hi> 4. Entituled, An Act
declaring how <hi>Poynings</hi> Act ſhall be expounded and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
for by the ſaid Act 10 H. 7. it is provided, That no
Parliament be hereafter holden in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but when the
Kings Lieutenant and Councell there firſt certifie the
King, under the Great Seal of that Land, the cauſes, &amp;c.
and ſuch cauſes, &amp;c. affirmed by the King and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel,
to be good and expedient for the Land, and his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
thereupon, &amp;c. A Parliament to be holden after
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57645:59"/>
the former before, &amp;c. And any Parliament holden con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
&amp;c. to be void in Law. Upon which Act, divers
Doubts were conceived.</p>
               <p>1. And firſt, Whether the ſaid Act 10 H. 7. does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the Succeſſors of H. 7. the Act ſpeaking onely of
the King generally, and not his Succeſſors.</p>
               <p>2. If the Queen <hi>Mary</hi> were within the word <hi>King,</hi> and
both were held affirmatively: for the word <hi>King</hi> being
ſpoke indefinitely, does extend in Law to all his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors:
And this is ſo expounded by the Act 3 and 4 <hi>P.</hi>
and <hi>M. viz.</hi> That the ſaid Act 10 H. 7. ſhall extend to
the King and Queens Majeſty, her Heirs and Succeſſors.
Secondly, where <hi>Povnings</hi> Act ſayes the Kings Lieutenant
and Councel, the ſaid Act 3 and 4 <hi>P.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> explains it to
extend to all other Officers the King ſhall Depute, by
what Name ſoever.</p>
               <p>3. The greateſt Doubt was upon theſe words of <hi>Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi>
Act; <hi>And ſuch Cauſes, Conſiderations, and Acts, affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the King and his Councel, to be good and expedient for
the Land, &amp;c.</hi> Whether the King may make any change
or alteration of the Cauſes, &amp;c. which ſhall be tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
hither from the Lieutenant and Councel of <hi>Ireland:</hi>
for that it is not affirmative, but correction and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them: and therefore it was neceſſary to explain,
that the Act 3 and 4 <hi>P.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> was in theſe words; <hi>Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the paſſing of the ſaid Acts, and in ſuch form and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
as they ſhould be ſent into</hi> England; <hi>or elſe for the
change or alteration of them, or any part of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. Another Doubt aroſe from theſe words; <hi>That
d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ne, a Parliament to be had:</hi> If at the ſame Parl. other
Acts, which have been affirmed or altered here, may be
Enacted there, which is explained by the ſaid laſt Act in
theſe words, <hi>viz. For paſſing and agreeing upon ſuch Acts,
and no others, as ſhall be returned, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. A fifth Doubt aroſe from the ſame words; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Lieutenant and Councel of <hi>Ireland,</hi> after the
Parliament begun, and <hi>pendente Parliamento,</hi> may upon
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57645:60"/>
debate there tranſmit any other Conſiderations, &amp;c. the
which ſaid Act 3 and 4 <hi>P.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> is by expreſs words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained,
they may.</p>
               <p>And it was unanimouſly Reſolved, That the Cauſes,
Conſiderations, and Acts, tranſmitted hither under the
Great Seal of <hi>Ireland,</hi> ought to be kept in the <hi>Chancery</hi> in
<hi>England,</hi> and not be remanded.</p>
               <p>2. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>3. If the Acts tranſmitted hither be in any part alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or changed here, the Act ſo altered muſt forthwith be
returned under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> for the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript

the Caſe was, One <hi>William Haynes</hi> had digged up the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

and buryed them again: And it was <hi>Reſolved</hi> by the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices

the Sheets remains in the Owners, that is, of him that
had the property therein, when the dead body was wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
therewith; as in 11 H. 4. If Apparel be put upon a
Boy, this is a Gift in Law, for the Boy hath Capacity to
take it; but a dead Body, being but a Lump of Earth,
hath no capacity: Alſo, it is not a Gift to the Perſon,
but beſtowed on the Body, for the Reverence towards it,
to expreſs the hope of Reſurrection. And therefore at
the ſecond Aſſizes he was ſeverally Indicted for taking
theſe Sheets: The firſt Indictment was of Petty-Larceny,
for which he was whipped: And at the ſame Aſſizes he
was Indicted for the Felonious taking the other three
Sheets, for which he had his Clergy, and eſcaped Death.</p>

                  <hi>Walter Chute</hi> Sewer to the King, exhibited a Petition
to the King, That for ſafety of the Realm, &amp;c. that he
would erect a new Office to Regiſter all Strangers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Realm, except Merchant-Strangers, to be kept at
<hi>London,</hi> and to grant it to the Petitioner, with a Fee, or
without. And all Strangers, except Merchant-ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
to depart the Realm in a certain time, unleſs they
take a Billet under the ſaid Regiſters Hand. Which Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,
the Lords of the Councel referred to Me, by their
Letters of the 13 <hi>Novemb.</hi> 1613. to conſider what the Law
is in that behalf, &amp;c. And upon Conference with the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices
of the Common-Pleas, and other Juſtices and Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons
at Sergeants Inne in <hi>Fleetſtreet,</hi> It was <hi>Reſolved,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Erection of ſuch New Offices, for the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of a private man, was againſt all Law, of what nature
ſoever: Therefore when one Captain <hi>Lee</hi> made ſuit to
the King, to have an Office to inventory the Goods of
thoſe that dyed Teſtate or Inteſtate, It was Reſolved by
my Lord Chancellor, and my Self, That ſuch Grant ſhall
be utterly void, being both againſt the Common-Law,
and the Statute 21 H. 8. In like manner, when another
ſued to have the Regiſtring of Birth-dayes, and the time
of death, &amp;c. So <hi>Mich.</hi> 19 <hi>Jac.</hi> To make a New Office
in the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> onely for making <hi>Lattitats,</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
void. So <hi>Littletons</hi> Suit, to name an Officer to be a
Gen. Reg. &amp;c. But the Suit was rejected (notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and others: See <hi>Hill.</hi> 12 <hi>Jac. Regis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Secondly, It was <hi>Reſolved,</hi> That it was inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
for divers Cauſes: 1. For a private man to have
private ends. 2. The numbring of Strangers by a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
man, would in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Princes will take offence at it. 3. It is to be conſidered,
what breach it will be to former Treaties.</p>
               <p>3. As to the third, It may be performed without any
Inconvenience; and ſo it was divided by the Lord <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leigh,</hi>
and other Lords of the Councel, 37 <hi>Eliz.</hi> To write
Letters to the Mayors, Bayliffs, &amp;c. of every City, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,
&amp;c. where any ſtrangers are reſident, to certifie
how many, and of what quality, &amp;c. which they are to
know, in reſpect of their Inhabitants, &amp;c. and this may
be done without any Writing; which being ſhewn to the
Lords, was by them well approved, and the Suits utterly

               <head>Concerning Benevolence.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> The Exaction under the good Name of <hi>Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi>
began thus: When King <hi>Edw.</hi> the 4th had a Subſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
granted him by Parl. in the 12th year of his Reign:
becauſe he could have no more by Parl, and with a Parl.
he could not have a Subſidy, he invented this Deviſe;
wherein obſerve 3 Things:</p>
               <p>1. The Cauſe. 2. The Invention. 3. The Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
               <p>1. The Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> who marryed <hi>Edw.</hi> the 4th
Siſter, ſollicited the King to joyn in War with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the <hi>French</hi> King: whereto he eaſily conſented, to
be revenged of him for aiding the Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> &amp;c.
And this was the cauſe.</p>
               <p>2. The Invention was; The King called before him
ſeveral times many of his wealthieſt Subjects, to declare
to them his Neceſſity and Purpoſe to levy War, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
of each of them a Sum of Money; which by the
King's extraordinary courteſie to them, they very freely
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57645:64"/>
yielded to. <hi>Amongſt the reſt, there was a Rich Widow, of
whom the King merily asked what ſhe would give him for
maintenance of his Wars: By my Faith</hi> (quoth ſhe) <hi>for your
lovely Countenance ſake, you ſhall have</hi> 20 l. <hi>which being
more than the King expected, he thanked her, and vouchſafed
to kiſs her: Upon which, ſhe preſently ſwore, he ſhould have</hi>
20 l. <hi>more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. The <hi>Succeſs</hi> was, That where the King called this
a <hi>Benevolence,</hi> yet many of the People did much grudge at
it, and called it a <hi>Malevolince.</hi>

becauſe it was granted but to parcel of the body, <hi>viz.</hi>

and of divers Lands of <hi>Eaſt-Bradenham,</hi> &amp;c. in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi>
in Fee; by Deed enfeoffed them in the uſe of the
ſaid <hi>Anne,</hi> who took <hi>Hungate</hi> to Husband, and had Iſſue by
him a Son and a Daughter, and he dyed. <hi>Anne</hi> obtained
the Wardſhip of the Son; and after, when the Son was of
the Age of 21 years, wanting onely 6 Weeks, by <hi>Dedimus

of a Fine of the ſaid Son, being of the Age afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
and ſick: And the Bill charged them all with Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
in procu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing the ſaid Son to acknowledge the ſaid
Fine, they knowing him under Age, and in Wardſhip as
aforeſaid; but there was no practice uſed by any of the
Defendants, but the Son of his own good-will levyed it:
And by Ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nture, the uſe was limited to his Mother the
ſaid <hi>Anne</hi> and her Heirs, with power of Revocation by the
Son, upon tender of 10 <hi>s.</hi> And this was in conſideration,
that the Mother had paid the Debts of his Father, which
were very great, and had obtained the Wardſhip of him,
and to confirm her Joynture: And that his Mother, if ſhe
pleaſed, might give it to his Brother, by <hi>Hungate,</hi> who was
but of half-bloud. And it appeared, the Mother knew the
Son to be within Age, but the Commiſſionars were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of it; nor did they ſend for the Church-Book, in
which his Age did appear, being in the ſame Pariſh. And
the Plaintiffs Councel prayed, that the Defendants ſhould
be puniſhed for their Miſdemeanour; And that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
Plaintiffs, who were Coſins, &amp;c. Heirs to the ſaid
Son of the entire bloud, ſhould be diſ-inherited by the
ſaid Fine.</p>
               <p>To which it was Reſolved, by the two Chief Juſtices,
and chief Baron, That there was not any Crime puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by the Law in this Caſe; for the Judges of the
Law, and of this Court, may puniſh Offences, &amp;c. but
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57645:66"/>
they cannot create Offences: nor do as <hi>Hannibal</hi> did, to
make his Way over the <hi>Alps,</hi> when he could find none:
for <hi>Judicandum enim legibus, &amp; ubi non eſt lex ibi nec eſt
tranſgreſſio:</hi> And therefore if a Fine levyed by an Infant,
be not Reverſed during his Minority, 'tis unavoidable in
Law, becauſe the Infants Age is to be tryed, <hi>Non teſtium
teſtimonio, non juratorum veredicto, ſed Judicis inſpectione
ſolummodo.</hi> F. N. B. <hi>ſol.</hi> 21. And for this it was Reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the ſaid Juſtices, That foraſmuch as no Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Circumvention was proved in any of the Parties,
of which they may be Indicted at the Suit of the King, or
puniſhed in this Court, that the Fine ſhall ſtand: And
it was not apparent to the Commiſſioners he was within
Age, ſeeing he wanted but ſix Weeks; but if they had
known it, it had been a Miſdemeanour in them.</p>

               <head>Mansfield's Caſe.</head>
               <p>23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> In the Court of Wards the Caſe was this:
<hi>Henry Buſhly</hi> ſeized in Fee of Lands in <hi>Northmims,</hi> in the
County of <hi>Hartford,</hi> by his Will in writing, demiſed the
ſaid Lands to <hi>Henry Buſhly</hi> his Son in Tail, the remainder
to <hi>William Buſhly.</hi> And becauſe his Son was within Age,
he demiſed the Education of him to <hi>Thomas Harriſon,</hi>
whom he made his Executor. Afterward it hapned, that
<hi>Henry</hi> the Son became a deformed Cripple, and proved
an Ideot, <hi>a Nativitate:</hi> which Ideot, by the practice of
<hi>Nichols,</hi> and others, was raviſhed from his Guardian, and
carryed upon mens ſhoulders to an unknown place, and
there kept in ſecret, till he had acknowledged a Fine of
his Lands to one <hi>Bothome,</hi> before Juſtice <hi>Southcot,</hi> 9 <hi>Eliz.</hi>
and by Indenture, the uſe of the Fine was declared to be
to the uſe of the Cognizee and his Heirs: which <hi>Bothome</hi>
12 <hi>Eliz.</hi> conveyd the ſaid Land to one <hi>Henry Mansfield.</hi>
And 22 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the ſaid <hi>Henry Buſhly</hi> the Son, was by Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
found an Ideot, <hi>a Nativitate:</hi> And upon this, 33
<hi>Eliz.</hi> the Court of Wards took order for poſſeſſion of the
Lands. And it was moved, That though the Fine binds
the Ideot; yet the Indentures are not ſufficient to direct
the Uſes. But it war Reſolved, That foraſmuch as he
was enabled by the Fine as to the Principle, he ſhall not
be diſabled to limit the Uſes, which are but as acceſſory:
The ſame is the Law of an Infant, and a Feme-Court.
And the ſaid <hi>Mansfield</hi> brought an Action of Treſpaſs in
the <hi>Common-Pleas</hi> againſt one <hi>Trott,</hi> Farmer of the ſaid
Lands, and the Iſſue was tryed at the Bar; and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Ideot brought out of the Court of Wards, to be
ſhewn to the Judges of the Common-Pleas, and to the
Jurors: And the Judges hearing that <hi>Mansfields</hi> Title
was under the Fine levyed by that Ideot, the Lord <hi>Dy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and Court cauſed a Juror, by conſent, to be withdrawn;
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57645:67"/>
and the Lord <hi>Dyer</hi> ſaid, That the Judge who took the Fine
was never worthy to take another: yet notwithſtanding:

               <p>In this Term, I moved the Juſtices in <hi>Sergeants</hi> Inne

of Peace may make a ſpecial Warrant to Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
&amp;c. to have the bodies of parties, who are to take
the Oath according to the Statute before them: And it
was Reſolved by all, <hi>unâ voce,</hi> that they may; and that
for two Reaſons.</p>
               <p>1. When the Statute gave power to Juſtices of the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57645:70"/>
Peace, to require any perſons &amp;c. to take the Oath; the
Law <hi>implicite</hi> gave power to make a Warrant to have the

               </p>
               <p>2. It is againſt the Offices of the Juſtices, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
given them by that Statute, that they ſhall go

cannot, becauſe they are not Offenders, till they refuſe
to take the Oath before them, or commit ſome Contempt

theſe two Statutes: And in the beginning of this Term
they were recited and debated; and after good conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and Conference together, It was Reſolved by all,
That if one be indicted for Recuſancy, the Court may
proceed by Proceſs, upon the Stat. 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> or by Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,

was, If the Tenure was by a mean, as of the ſaid Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,

That the Letters-Patents ſhall be conſtrued to the Kings
Intention expreſſed; and in this Caſe, ſome Words ought

words, (<hi>De mancrio noſtro de</hi> Eaſt-Greenwich) for both

               <p>But it was Anſwered, and Reſolved, That the ſaid
Grange was held of the King, as of the <hi>Honor,</hi> and not in
<hi>Capite:</hi> And the Reaſon was, becauſe that Tenure of the
King in <hi>Capite,</hi> is as much as to ſay, Tenure in groſs, or
of the Perſon of the King. And it appears by antient Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
that in Old Time, all Tenures in Groſs, or of the
Perſon of a Subject, were called Tenures in <hi>Capite;</hi> as
in <hi>Clauſ.</hi> 9 <hi>H.</hi> 3. <hi>membr.</hi> 28. and many other Records; but

Inaſmuch, as it is limited to hold of the King who is
Chief, it may be vulgarly ſaid, That the Tenure is in
Chief; inaſmuch as it is of the King, as of a Mannor.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It was Reſolved, That the abundant Words

               <p>IN Treſpaſs brought by <hi>Richard Stallon,</hi> againſt <hi>Thomas

1845.) for breaking his Houſe and Cloſe at <hi>Fendit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
in Com. <hi>Cambridge:</hi> And the New Aſſignment was
in an Acre of Paſture. The Defendant pleads, that the
Place where, &amp;c. was the Land and Freehold of <hi>Thomas
Willowes,</hi> and <hi>Richard Willowes;</hi> and that he, as Servant,
&amp;c. The Plaintiff for Replication ſaith, That the
Place where was parcel of the Mannor of <hi>Fenditton,</hi> and
demiſable, &amp;c. by Copy of Court-Roll in Fee-ſimple;
and that the Lords of the Mannor, granted the Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

ſurrendred them to the ſaid <hi>Willowes,</hi> and <hi>Willowes,</hi> Lords
of the ſaid Mannor, to the uſe of the Plaintiff and his
Heirs, who was admitted, &amp;c. The Defendant rejoyns,
and ſaith; True it is, that the Tenements in which &amp;c.
were parcel of the Mannor, and demiſable &amp;c. and the
ſurrender and admittance ſuch <hi>prout,</hi> &amp;c. But the ſaid
<hi>Bradye</hi> further ſaith, That the Tenements in which, &amp;c.

                  </hi> aforeſaid, requeſted the
ſaid <hi>Richard Stallon</hi> to pay them the ſaid 5 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> which
the ſaid <hi>Richard</hi> utterly refuſed, &amp;c. By which, the ſaid
<hi>Richard</hi> forfeited to the ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Richard Willowes</hi>
all his Right, Eſtate, &amp;c. The Plaintiff ſurjoyneth, and
ſaith, that the ſaid ſum of 5 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> &amp;c. was not <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionabilis
finis,</hi> as the ſaid <hi>Thomas Bradley</hi> above hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged,
&amp;c. Upon which, the Defendant doth demur
in Law, &amp;c. And in this Caſe, theſe Points were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
by <hi>Coke</hi> Chief Juſtice, <hi>Walmeſly, Warberton, Daniel,</hi>
and <hi>Foſter,</hi> Juſtices.</p>
               <p>1. If the Fine had been reaſonable, yet the Lords
ought to have ſet a certain time and place when the ſame
ſhould be paid, becauſe it ſtands <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>on the point of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57645:74"/>
As if a man aſſures Lands to one and his Heirs, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
condition to pay to the Bargainee and his Heirs 10 <hi>l.</hi>
at ſuch a place; or that he and his heirs ſhall re-enter:
there, becauſe no time is limited, the Bargainor ought to
give notice to the Bargainee, &amp;c. when he will tender
the money, and he cannot tender it when he pleaſeth: and
with this agrees 19 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 244. So in the Caſe at
the Bar, the Copyholder is not bound to carry his Fine
alwayes with him, &amp;c. And though that the Rejoynder
is, that the Plaintift refuſed to pay the Fine; ſo he might
well do, when the Requeſt is not lawful or reaſonable:
And he that is to pay a great Fine, as 100 <hi>l.</hi> or more, it
is not reaſonable that he carry it always with him; And
the Copyholder was not bound to do it, becauſe the Fine
was incertain and arbitrable; as was Reſolved in <hi>Hul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barts</hi>
Caſe, in the 4th Part of my Reports, among the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py-hold
Caſes.</p>
               <p>2. It was Reſolved, That though the Fine be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
and arbitrable; yet it ought to be <hi>ſecundum ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrium
boni viri;</hi> and it ought to be reaſonable, becauſe
<hi>Exceſſus in re qualibet, jure reprobatur communi:</hi> for the
Common-Law forbids any exceſſive Diſtreſs, as appears
41 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 26. And this doth appear to be the Common-Law;
for the Statute of <hi>Articuli ſuper Chartas</hi> extends
onely for a grievous Diſtreſs taken for the Kings Debt.
See <hi>F. N. B.</hi> 147. <hi>a.</hi> and 27 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 51. 28 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 50. 11 <hi>H.</hi>
4. 2. and 8 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 16. &amp;c. And ſo if an exceſſive Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciament
be impoſed in any Cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t-Baron, or other Court
not of Record, the Party ſhall have <hi>Moderata miſ ericordia.</hi>
And <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is but an Affirmance of the Common-Law
in this Point. See <hi>F. N. B.</hi> 75. And the Common-Law
gives an Aſſize of <hi>Sovient</hi> Diſtreſs, and multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Diſtreſs found, which is Exceſs. And with this
agrees 27 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 50, 51. F. N. B. 178 <hi>b.</hi> And if Tenant
in Dower, hath Tenants at Will, that are rich, and
makes them poor, by exceſſive Tallages and Fines, this is
waſt, F. N. B. 61. <hi>b.</hi> 16 H. 3. <hi>Waſt.</hi> 135. and 16 H. 7.

terrae in Villenagio in Villa praed. &amp;c.</hi> By all which it
appears, the Common-Law forbids exceſſive oppreſſing
of Villains, &amp;c. So in the Caſe at Bar, though the Fine
is uncertain, yet it ought to be reaſonable; and ſo it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the Cuſtome alleadged by the Defendant. See
<hi>Hubbard</hi>'s Caſe before, in the 4th Part of my Reports.
And when reaſonableneſs concerning a Fine is in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the ſame ſhall be determined by the Court, in which
the Action depend, 21 H. 6. 30. 22 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4 27. and 50
29 H. 8. 32. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. It was Reſolved, That the Fine in the Caſe at the
Bar was unreaſonable, being for the admittance of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py-holder
in Fee-ſimple, upon a Surrender made; for
this is not like a voluntary Grant, &amp;c. for there <hi>Arbitrio
Domini res eſtimari debet.</hi> But when the Lord is compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable,
to admit him to whoſe uſe the Surrender is; And
when <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſtuy que uſe</hi> is admitted, he ſhall be in by him
who made the Surrender, and the Lord is but an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to preſent the ſame.</p>
               <p>4. It was Reſolved, That the Surjoinder is no more,
than what the Law ſaith: And for the Cauſes aforeſaid,
Judgment was given for the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Coke</hi> Chief Juſtice ſaid in this Caſe, That if the
Court of Admiralty amerce the Defendant exceſſively at
diſcretion (as ſeems by 19 H. 6. 7.) the ſame ſhall
not bind the Party; and be it exceſſive or not, it ſhall
be determined in the Court, where the Action ſhall be
brought: And a Writ of Account againſt a Bayliff or

And becauſe the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> hath a

ſaid in the Title, Preamble, and Body of the Act, that
when the Archbiſhop ſitting in his exempt Peculiar in

there the word (<hi>ſuch</hi>) in the Body of the Act, referring

               <p>2. The Body of the Act is, No Perſon ſhall be hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth

And the words (<hi>out of the Dioceſs</hi>) are meant of the
Dioceſs or Juriſdiction of the Ordinary where he dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth.</p>
               <p>3. Obſerve, the Preamble of the Act recites expreſly,
That the Subjects were called by compulſory Proceſs to
appear in the Arches, Audience, and other Courts of the
Archbiſhoprick of this Realm: So that the Intention of
the Act was to reduce the Archbiſhop to his proper Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
unleſs in five Caſes.</p>
               <p>1. For any Spiritual Offence or Cauſe committed, or
omitted, contrary to Right and Duty by the Biſhop, &amp;c.
which word (<hi>omitted</hi>) proves, there ought to be a Default
in the Ordinary.</p>
               <p>2. Except it be in Caſe of Appeal, and other lawfull
Cauſe, where the Party ſhall find himſelf grieved by the
Ordinary, after the matter there firſt begun, <hi>ergo,</hi> it
ought to be firſt begun before the Ordinary.</p>
               <p>3. In caſe the Biſhop or Ordinary, &amp;c. dare not, or
will not convent the Party to be ſued before him.</p>
               <p>4. In caſe the Biſhop or Judge of the place, within
whoſe Juriſdiction, or before whom the Suit by this Act
ſhould be begun and proſecuted, be party, directly, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly,
to the Matter or Cauſe of the ſame Suit.</p>
               <p>5. In caſe any Biſhop, or other inferiour Judge under
him, &amp;c. make Requeſt to the Archbiſhop, Biſhop, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
inferiour Ordinary or Judge; and that to be done
in Caſes onely, where the Law Civil or Common doth
affirm, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>1. Alſo there are two Proviſoes which explain it alſo,
<hi>viz.</hi> That it ſhall be lawful for every Archbiſhop, to
cite any perſon inhabiting in any Biſhop, Dioceſs in his
Province for matter of Hereſie: by which it appears, that
for all Cauſes not excepted, he is prohibited by the
Act.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:57645:77"/>
2. There is a ſaving for the Archbiſhop, calling any
Perſon out of the Dioceſs where he ſhall be dwelling, to
the Probate of any Teſtament: which Proviſoe ſhould be
vain, if notwithſtanding that Act ſhould have concurrent
Authority with every Ordinary throughout his whole
Province: Wherefore it was concluded, That the Arch-Biſhop
out of his Dioceſs, unleſs in the Caſes excepted, is
prohibited by the 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. to cite any man out of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Dioceſſe: which Act is but a Law declaratory of
the antient Canons, and a true Expoſition of them. And
that appears by the Canon, <hi>Cap. Romana in ſexto de Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellationibus,
&amp; Cap. de competenti in ſexto.</hi> And the ſaid
Act is ſo expounded, by all the Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> at a
Convocation at <hi>London, Anno</hi> 1 Jac. <hi>Regis,</hi> 1603. <hi>Canon</hi>
94.</p>
               <p>And whereas it is ſaid in the Preamble of the Act, in
the Arches, Audience, and other High-Courts of this
Realm: It is to be known, that the Archbiſhop of this
Realm, before that Act, had power <hi>Legantine</hi> from the
Pope; By which they had Authority not onely over all,
but concurrent Authority with every Ordinary, &amp;c. not as
Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> &amp;c. but by his Power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
Legantine. <hi>Et tria ſunt genera</hi> Legatorum; 1. <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam

Which Authority Legantine is now taken away and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
utterly.</p>
               <p>3. It was Reſolved, That when any Judges are by
Act of Parliament, if they proceed againſt the Act, there
a Prohibition lyes. As againſt the Steward and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal

               <head> Edward's Caſe.</head>
               <p>The High-Commiſſioners, in Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical,
objected divers <hi>Engliſh</hi> Articles, againſt <hi>Thomas Edwards</hi>
of <hi>Exeter:</hi> As,</p>
               <p>1. That Mr. <hi>John Walton,</hi> being trained up in <hi>Oxferd</hi>
Univerſity, was there worthily admitted to ſeveral De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of Schools, and deſervedly took upon him the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Dr. of Phyſick.</p>
               <p>2. That he was a Reverend and well-practiſed man in
the Art of Phyſick.</p>

you the ſaid <hi>Edwards,</hi> &amp;c. of purpoſe to diſgrace the ſaid
Dr. <hi>Walton,</hi> &amp;c. did, againſt the Rules of Charity, write
and ſend to the ſaid Dr. <hi>Walton,</hi> a leud and uncharitable
Letter, taxing him therein of want of Skill and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in his Profeſſion, &amp;c. And ſo far you exceeded in
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57645:78"/>
your ſaid uncivil Letter; that you told him therein, in
plain terms, <hi>He may be crowned for an Aſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>5. And further to diſgrace the ſaid Mr. Dr. <hi>Walton,</hi> in
the ſaid Univerſity, did publiſh a Copy of the ſaid Letter
to Sir <hi>William Courtney,</hi> and others; and in your Letter
was contained <hi>Sipſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And did you not covertly imply thereby, that
the ſaid Dr. <hi>Waltons</hi> Father (late Biſhop of <hi>Exeter</hi>) was
ſubject to the <hi>French</hi> Pox and Leproſie, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>6. That in another Letter you ſent to Dr. <hi>Maders,</hi> Dr.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n
in your Letter: Whether you meant not thereby, that
they were both Cuckolds; or what other meaning you
had.</p>
               <p>7. You knowing Dr. <hi>Walton</hi> to be one of the High-Commiſſion
in the Dioceſs of <hi>Exeter;</hi> and having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
a Sentence againſt him in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> for
contriving and publiſhing a Libel, did triumphingly ſay,
You had gotten on the Hip a Commiſſioner for Cauſes
Eccleſiaſtical, &amp;c. which you did to diſgrace him, and
in him the whole Commiſſion in thoſe Parts.</p>
               <p>8. That after the Letter Miſſive ſent to you, you ſaid
arrogantly, That you cared not for any thing this Court
can do, for that you can remove this Matter at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>And this Term it was moved to have a Prohibition in
this Caſe; and the matter was well argued: And at laſt
it was Reſolved by <hi>Coke</hi> Chief Juſtice, <hi>Warberton, Daniel,</hi>
and <hi>Foſter,</hi> Juſtices; That the firſt ſix Articles were meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Temporal; and, in truth, is, in the nature of an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon the Caſe, for Scandal of Dr. <hi>Walton</hi> in his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of Phyſick: and therefore, for them a Prohibition
doth lye, for divers Cauſes.</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe the Perſons and Matters are Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:57645:78"/>
2. Becauſe it is for Defamation; which if any ſuch
ſhall be for the ſame, it ought to begin before the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
becauſe it is not ſuch an enormous Offence, which
is to be determined by the High-Commiſſioners; nor
doth Suit lye before them, for calling the Doctor Cuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>old,
as in the ſeventh Article: And 'twas ſaid, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
ought to incur the danger of <hi>Praemunire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It was Reſolved, That the Eccleſiaſtical Judge
cannot examine any man upon his Oath, upon the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Thought of his Heart; for <hi>cogitationis poenam
nemo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>moret:</hi> for the Proverb ſaith, <hi>Thought is free.</hi> And
therefore for the 6th and 7th, were Reſolved, as well for
the Matter, as for the Form, to be ſuch, to which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
was not compelled to anſwer: And that to the
7th, he might juſtifie the ſame; becauſe it appears upon
his own ſhewing, that the Doctor was ſentenced in the
<hi>Star Chamber:</hi> Alſo, the Libel is meer Temporal; and if
it were Spiritual, ſuch a Defamation is not examinable
before the High-Commiſſioners.</p>
               <p>As to the laſt Article, it appeareth now by the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Court, that he might well juſtifie the ſaid
Words: Alſo, the Commiſſioners ſhall not have any
Conuzance of Scandal to themſelves, they being Parties;
and ſuch Scandal puniſhable by the Common-Law, as was
reſolved in <hi>Hales</hi> Caſe in <hi>Dyer,</hi> and in my Book of Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,

The Defendant demurred in Law, upon the Informa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>on,
and Judgment was given againſt him by the Barons. And
now in this Term, upon a Writ of Errour, the Matter
was argued at <hi>Sergeants</hi> Inne before the two Chief Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
And two matters were moved.</p>
               <p>1. One, That a Brewer is not within the ſaid Branch
of the ſaid Act; for the words are, That it ſhall not be
lawful to any Perſons, other than ſuch as now uſe lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
any Art, Myſtery, or Manual Occupation, to ſet up or
uſe any Art, Miſtery, or Manual Occupation, except he
ſhall have been brought up therein 7 years at leaſt as an
Apprentice. And 'twas ſaid, That the Trade of a Brewer
is not any Air, Miſtery, or Manual Occupation within
the ſaid Branch, becauſe it is eaſily and preſently lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and needs not 7 years Apprenticeſhip to learn the
ſam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, it being every Country Houſewifes Work: And
the Act of <hi>H.</hi> 8. is, That a Brewer is not a Handicraft
Artificer.</p>
               <p>2. It was moved, That the ſaid Averment was not
ſufficient; for it ought to be as general, as the Exception
in the Statute is.</p>
               <p>1. To the firſt, it was Reſolved, That the Trade of a
Brewer, <hi>viz.</hi> To hold a Common Brewhouſe, to ſell Beer
or Ale to another, is an Art and Myſtery within the ſaid
Act: for in the beginning of it, it is Enacted, That no
Perſon ſhall be retained for leſs time than a whole year
in any the Services, Grafts, Myſteries, or Arts of Cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57645:79"/>
&amp;c. Bakers, Brewers, &amp;c. Cooks &amp;c. Upon which
words in the ſaid Branch, the Information is grounded:
Alſo, becauſe every Houſewife brews for her private uſe;
ſo alſo ſhe bakes and dreſſeth meat; yet none can hold a
Common Bakehouſe, or Cooks Shop, to ſell to others,
unleſs he hath been an Apprentice, &amp;c. And the Act 22
<hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 13. is explained, That a Brewer, Baker, Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and Scrivener, are not Handicrafts mentioned in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
penal Laws; but the ſame doth not prove, but they
are Arts or Myſteries.</p>
               <p>2. As to the ſecond, it was Reſolved, That the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Act was, that none ſhould take upon him any
Art, but he who hath Skill or knowledg in the ſame: for,
<hi>Quod quiſque norit in hoc ſe exerceat.</hi> And ſo the firſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was affirmed.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sherly</hi> Sergeant moved to have a Prohibition, becauſe
a Parſon ſued to have Tythes of <hi>Sylva Coedua,</hi> under 20
years growth in the Weild of <hi>Kent,</hi> where by the Cuſtom
no Tythes were ever paid of any Wood: And if ſuch a
Cuſtom, <hi>in non Decimando,</hi> for all Lay-people within the
ſaid Weild, were lawful or not, was the Queſtion. And
to have a Prohibition, it was ſaid, That though one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
man ſhall not preſcribe <hi>in non Decimando;</hi> yet ſuch
a general Cuſtom within a great Countrey might well
be; as in 43 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 32. And the 45 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Cuſtome</hi> 15.
where an Abbot purchaſed Tenements after the Statute
&amp;c. and ſaith, That being Lord of the Town, &amp;c. there
was a Cuſtom in the ſaid Town, that when Tenant ceſſeth
for 2 years, the Lord may enter, &amp;c. And that his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
ceſſed for 2 years, and he entred: And the Rule of
the Court is, Becauſe it was an uſage only in that Town,
he was put to anſwer, by which appears, that a Cuſtom
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57645:80"/>
was not good in a particular Town; that perhaps might
be good in a Countrey, &amp;c. See 40 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 21. &amp; 27. 39

<hi>Draycot,</hi> contrary to the Kings Prohibition, &amp;c. and the
Parſon was condemned in 20 Marks, &amp;c. which agrees
with the Rule and Reaſon of the Law, continued unto this
day: For Preſidents in <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. <hi>H.</hi> 3. and King <hi>John,</hi>
and more antient, are not to be now followed, unleſs they
agree with the Law and practice at this day; Statutes
having changed ſome, and <hi>Deſuetudo</hi> antiquated others.
There are two Points adjudged by the ſaid Record.</p>
               <p>1. That ſatisfaction may be given in diſcharge of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Tythes: And if the Succeſſor of the Parſon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the thing given in ſatisfaction of the Tythes, and yet
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57645:80"/>
ſueth for Tythes in kind, he ſhall have a Prohibition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that he chargeth his Layfee with Tythes, which is
diſcharged of them: By which it doth appear, that
Tythes cannot be diſcharged, and altogether taken away
and extin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. And herewith agrees the <hi>Regiſter,</hi> which is
the moſt ancient Law-Book, <hi>fol.</hi> 38. By which alſo it
appears, That Tythes may be diſcharged, and that the
matter of diſcharge ought to be determined by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law,
and not in the Spiritual Court. Alſo by the
Act of <hi>Circumſpecte agatis,</hi> made 13 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. It is ſaid, <hi>S.

28. the Ordinance of <hi>Circumſpecte agatis</hi> is not a

yet then the Prelates acknowledged, That there
were Tythes due by Cuſtome, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>is a <hi>Modus

Cuſtom, may be altered to another thing. See 8 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4.

Lord of a Mannor hath alwayes holden his Mannor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
of Tythes, and the Parſon had before time of

the Lord, of which the Parſon is ſeized at this in Fee; in

the Parſon now ſue for Tythes of the ſaid Mannor, the
Owner of the Mannor may ſhew that ſpecial Matter, &amp;c.
And the Proof, that the Lord of the Mannor gave the
Lands, that Tythes ſhould never be paid, at this day is
good Evidence, to prove the ſurmiſe of the Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

that the Pope, by his Bulls, diſcharged divers from pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

by which appears, one may be diſcharged of Tythes five
wayes.</p>
               <p>1. By the Law of the Realm, <hi>viz.</hi> the Common-Law,
as Tythes ſhall not be paid of Coales, Quarries, Bricks,
Tyles, &amp;c. <hi>F. N. B.</hi> 53. and <hi>Reg.</hi> 54. nor of the after-Paſture
of a Meadow, &amp;c. nor of Rakings, nor of Wood

               <p>2. By the Statutes of the Realm, as 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 13. 45 <hi>Ed.</hi>
3. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3. By Priviledge; as thoſe of St. <hi>Johns</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in

out of the <hi>Regiſter:</hi> By all which appears, That a
man may be diſcharged of payment of Tythes as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.
So as now it is apparent by the Law <hi>of England,</hi>

               <p>The ſecond Point, which agrees with the Law at this

That the Limits and Bounds of Towns and Pariſhes, ſhall
be trayed by the Common-Law, and not by the Spirituall
Court. And in this the Law hath great Reaſon, for
thereupon depends the Title of Inheritance of the Layfee,
whereof the Tythes were demanded; for Fines and Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
are the common Aſſurances of Lay-Inheritances;
and if the Spiritual Court ſhould try the Bounds of
Towns, if they determine that my Land lyeth in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Town, than is contained in my Fine, Recovery, or

could have no Relief, till the Attainder was rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
               <p>As to the other Objection, That the Demandant on

was Reſolved, That it needed not in this Caſe, becauſe the
Title of Dower, ſtood with the Queens Title, and affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it. Alſo, in this Caſe, the Queen was not intitled by
any Office, that the Wife ſhould be driven to traverſe

of Dower, though that Office had been found for the

               <p>And the Caſe put on the other ſide, was utterly denied
by the Court; for it was Reſolved, That if a man ſeized
of Lands in F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

alien his Lands; and after the Wife attains to the Age
of nine years, and afterwards the Husband dyeth, that ſhe
ſhall be endowed; becauſe the Title of Dower being
not conſummate till the death of the Husband, and there
being Marriage, Seizin in Fee, age of 9 years, and the
Husbands death, for that cauſe ſhe ſhall be endowed; it
being ſufficient, that the Marriage, Seizin, and Age hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
during the Coverture. So if a man ſeized of Lands
in Fee take a Wife, and after ſhe elopes from her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
now ſhe is barrable of her Dower, if during the
elopement, the Husband alien; and after the Wife is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled,
ſhe is Dowable: So if a man hath Iſſue by his
Wife, and the Iſſue dyeth, and afterwards Land diſcends
to the Wife, or ſhe purchaſe Lands in Fee, and dyes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
other Iſſue, the Husband (for the Iſſue which he had
before the Diſcent or Purchaſe) ſhall be Tenant by the
Courteſie. But if a man taketh an Alien to Wife, and
afterwards he aliens his Lands, and after that ſhe is made
a Denizen, ſhe ſhall not be endowed; for ſhe was not by
her Birth capable of Dower, but by her Denization it
began. But in the other Caſe, there was onely a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary

being accompliſht, the Temporary Bar ceaſeth.</p>

the Spiritual Court, that he had divided the Tythes from

the 14 <hi>s.</hi> 10 <hi>d.</hi> in the Caſe at Bar, was clearly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Statute; for the Act is in the Negative: And
if the Executor requires the Teſtament to be ingroſſed in
Parchment, he ought to agree with him, that he requires
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57645:88"/>
to do it, as he may. But the Ordinary, Official, &amp;c.
ought not to exact any Fee for the ſame, as due to him,
for divers cauſes.</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe the words of the Act are expreſſed for the
Probation, &amp;c. and for the Regiſtring, Scaling, Writing,
&amp;c. Which word (<hi>Writing</hi>) extends expreſly to this
Caſe.</p>
               <p>2. The words are, (<hi>or any thing concerning the ſame
Probate</hi>) and when the Seal and Probate is put to the
Tranſcript, the ſame (without queſtion) concerns the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate.</p>
               <p>3. Such a Conſtruction would make the Act idle and
vain; for if the Ordinary, Official, &amp;c. might take as
much as he pleaſeth, for the Ingroſſing done by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
as a due to him, all the purview of the Statute,
which is penned ſo preciſely concerning perſons, ſhould
be all in vain, by that evaſion of Tranſcribing it, as well
againſt the expreſs Letter of the Act, as the intention of
it. And the Act ought to be expounded, to ſuppreſs Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion,
which is a great affliction and impoveriſhing of
the Subjects.</p>
               <p>4. As this Caſe is, he annexes the Probate and Seal to
the Tranſcript ingroſſed, which the Plaintiff brought
him; ſo as the Caſe at Bar was with queſtion: And
afterwards the Jury found for the Plaintiff. And of ſuch
Opinion was <hi>Walmeſly, Warberton, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Foſter,</hi> Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices,
the next Term in all things: But upon Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

in the Information, Judgment is not yet given, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>In this Term, a Queſtion was moved to the Court,
which was this: If Tenant in Burgage ſhould pay aid
to the King, to make his eldeſt Son Knight. And the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57645:89"/>
Point reſts upon this: If Tenure in Burgage, be a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure
in Socage; for by the antient Common-Law every
Tenant in Knights Service, and in Socage, was to give to
his Lord a reaſonable Ayd, to make his eldeſt Son a
Knight, and to marry his eldeſt Daughter; and that was
uncertain at Common-Law, and alſo incertain when the
ſame ſhould be paid. And this appears by <hi>Glanvil, lib.</hi> 9.

Chapter it is called <hi>rationabile auxilium,</hi> becauſe then it
was not certain, but to be moderated by Reaſon, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect

Act put thoſe incertainties to a certainty.</p>

               <p>2. That none might levy ſuch Ayd, to make his Son a

                     </gap>t.</hi> 3. And another, in an Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of a Riotous Reſcue by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bill, by the Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-General,
againſt <hi>Chriſtopher Dickenſon,</hi> one of the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs
of <hi>York,</hi> and others, in reſcuing one <hi>William Watſon,</hi>
out of the Cuſtody of the Deputy of one of the Purſey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of the ſaid Councel, who had Arreſted the ſaid <hi>Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi>
by force of a Commiſſion of Rebellion, by the ſaid
Preſident and Councel awarded: Which <hi>Prohibition,</hi>
upon the Information, was (as was ſaid) denyed, upon a
Motion in the <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> the laſt Term; but granted by
Us. And the King ſent for me, to anſwer the Complaint;
and I onely, all the reſt of the Juſtices being abſent,
waited upon the King; who, in the preſence of <hi>Egerton,</hi>
Lord Chancellor, and others of the Privy-Councel, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed
to me the Complaint aforeſaid. And I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
well, that the King had thereupon conceived great
diſpleaſure againſt the Judges of the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> but
chiefly againſt Me: To which (I having the Copy of
the Complaint ſent me by the Lord Treaſurer) an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
in this manner: That I had made ſearch in the
Office of <hi>Prothonotaries</hi> of the <hi>Common-Pleas;</hi> and as to
the Caſes between <hi>Bell</hi> and <hi>Thawpts,</hi> and <hi>Snell</hi> and <hi>Huet,</hi>
no ſuch could be found; but I would not take advantage
of a Miſpriſal: And the truth was, the 6th of <hi>February,</hi>
the Court of <hi>Common-Pleas</hi> had granted a <hi>Prohibition</hi> to
the Preſident and Councel of <hi>York,</hi> between <hi>Lock</hi> Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff,
and <hi>Bell</hi> and others Defendants; and that was a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plevin</hi>
in <hi>Engliſh</hi> was granted by the ſaid Preſident and
Councel, which I affirmed was utterly againſt Law: for
at Common-Law no <hi>Replevin</hi> ought to be made, but by
Original Writ directed to the Sheriff: and the Statute
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57645:91"/>
of <hi>Marlbridge, cap.</hi> 21. and <hi>Weſt.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. authorize the
Sheriff to make a <hi>Replevin.</hi> So 29 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 21. 8 <hi>Eliz.
Dyer</hi> 245. And the King by his Inſtructions neither had
made the Preſident and Councel Sheriffs, nor could
grant them Power to make a <hi>Replevin</hi> againſt Law; which
the Lord Chancellor affirmed for very good Law; and
it may well be, we have granted others in the like Caſe.
Another <hi>Prohibition,</hi> I confeſs, we have granted between
Sir <hi>Bethel Knight,</hi> now Sheriff of the County of <hi>York,</hi> as
Executor to one <hi>Stephenſon,</hi> who made him and another
his Executors, and preferred an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bill againſt
<hi>Chambers,</hi> and others, in nature of an Action of the Caſe,
upon a Trover and Converſion of Goods and Chattels in
the Teſtators Life, to the value of 1000 <hi>l.</hi> And becauſe
the other Executor would not joyn with him, he had no
remedy at Common-Law; but was forced to pray reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
there in Equity. And I ſay, the Preſident and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
have not any Authority to proceed in that Caſe, for
divers cauſes.</p>
               <p>1. Becauſe there is an expreſs Limitation in their
Commiſſion, that they ſhall not hold Plea between Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Party, &amp;c. unleſs both or one of the Parties, <hi>tanta
paupertate ſunt gravati,</hi> that they cannot ſue at Common-Law;
and in that Caſe the Plaintiff was a Knight, She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff,
and man of great quality.</p>
               <p>2. Becauſe by that Suit the King was deceived of his
Fine, which was 200 <hi>l.</hi> becauſe the Damages amounted
to 4000 <hi>l.</hi> And that was one of the Cauſes, that the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff
began his Suit there, and not at Common-Law. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Cauſe was, that their <hi>Decrees</hi> which they take upon
them, are final and uncontroulable, either by Errour, or
any other Remedy; which is not ſo in the Kings Courts,
where there are five Judges: for they can deny Juſtice
to none who hath Right; nor give any Judgment, but
what is controulable by Errou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. And if we ſhall
not grant <hi>Prohibitions,</hi> in Caſes where they hold Plea
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57645:91"/>
without Authority, then the Subjects ſhall be wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
oppreſſed without Law, and we denyed to do them
Juſtice. And their Ignorance in the Law appeared, by
allowing that Suit, <hi>viz.</hi> That the one Executor had no
Remedy at Common Law, becauſe the other would not
joyn in Suit with him; whereas every one Learn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d in
the Law knows, that Summons and Severance lyeth in
any Suit brought as Executors. And this was alſo affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Lord Chancellor.</p>
               <p>Another <hi>Prohibition,</hi> I confeſs, we granted between the
L. <hi>Wharton,</hi> who by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bill, before the Councel,
ſued <hi>Bank S. Buttermere,</hi> and others, for fiſhing in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Fiſhings in <hi>Darwent,</hi> in the County of <hi>C.</hi> in nature
of an Action of Treſpaſs at Common-Law, to his Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
of 200 <hi>l.</hi> and for the Cauſes before recited; and
becauſe the ſame was meerly determinable at Common-Law,
we granted a <hi>Prohibition:</hi> And that alſo was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Lord Chancellor. Then the King asked me the
Caſe of Information upon the Riotous Reſcous: To
which, I anſwered, That one exhibited a Bill there, in the
nature of an Action of Debt, upon a <hi>Mutuatus</hi> againſt
<hi>Watſon,</hi> who upon his Oath affirmed, that he had ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
the Plaintiff, and owed him nothing: yet becauſe
he did not deny the Debt, the Councel Decreed the ſame
againſt him; And upon that Decree, the Purſuyvant
was ſent to Arreſt the ſaid <hi>Watſon,</hi> who Arreſted him;
upon which the Reſcous was made: And becauſe the
Action was in the nature of an Action of D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, upon a
<hi>Mutuatus,</hi> where the Defendant at Common Law might
have waged his Law, the <hi>Prohibition</hi> was granted; and
that was alſo affirmed by the Lord Chancellor. Alſo, I
affirmed it was Reſcous, becauſe the principal cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
not to them; but it might be a Riot, yet not
puniſhable by them, but by courſe of Law, by a Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:57645:92"/>
Alſo, I confeſs, that we have granted divers <hi>Prohibitions</hi>
to ſtay Suits there by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bill, upon penal Statutes,
for the manner of proſecution, as well for the Action,
Proceſs, &amp;c. as for the Count, is to be purſued, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be altered: and therefore, without queſtion, the
Councel, in ſuch Caſes, cannot hold Plea; which was
affirmed alſo by the Lord Chancellor. And I ſaid, no
Court of Equity can be Erected at this day without Act
of Parl, as was Reſolved in Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> time in <hi>Parots</hi> Caſe;
and lately in the Caſe of the Preſident and Councel of
<hi>Wales.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the King was well ſatisfied with theſe Reaſons,
who gave me his Royal Hand, and I departed from
thence in his favour.</p>

               <p>This Term a Queſtion was moved at <hi>Sergeants Inne,</hi>
who, by the Common-Law, ought to repair the Bridges,
common Rivers and Sewers, and the High-ways, and by
what means they ſhall be compelled to it; and firſt of
Bridges. And as to them, it is to be known, that of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
right all the Country ſhall be charged: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
agrees, 10 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 28. <hi>b.</hi> and the Star. 22 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.
was but an affirmance of the Common-Law in that
Point. He that hath Toll of Men or Cattel paſſing over
a Bridge, ought to repair the ſame, when no other is
bound by Law to do it, for he hath Toll to that purpoſe:
<hi>Et quiſentit commodam, ſentire debet &amp; onus:</hi> and with
this agrees 14 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Bar.</hi> 276. Alſo, a man may be bound
to repair a Bridge, <hi>ratione tenurae,</hi> of certain Land, but a
particular perſon cannot be bound by Preſcription: for
if he have not profit by the ſame, his Anceſtors Act ſhall
not bind him: But an Abbot or Corporation may be
charged by Preſcription, and may bind their Succeſſors.

they ſhall be compelled, if time out of mind they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
it, though of Alms; and therewith agrees 10 <hi>E.</hi> 3.
28. So of a High-way, all the Country ought to repair
it; but ſome may be bound particularly, as in the Caſe
of Bridges. As he who hath Land adjoyning, ought to
ſcour and cleanſe the Ditches, next to the way to his
Land; and therewith agrees the Book, 8 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 5. So of a
common River, all who have Paſſage by it, ought to ſcour

               <head> Sir William Reades and
Booth's Caſe.</head>
               <p>In the great Caſe of Forgery in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Sir <hi>William Read</hi> Plaintiff, and <hi>Roger Booth,</hi> and
<hi>Cuthbert Booth,</hi> and others, Defendants; the Caſe was thus:
<hi>Roger Booth</hi> 38 <hi>Eliz.</hi> was Convict in that Court of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
a Writing under Seal, forged in Sir <hi>Thomas Greſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
Name, of a Rent charge of 100 <hi>l.</hi> out of all his
Lands, &amp;c. to one <hi>Markham</hi> for 99 years, dated 21 year
of Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> Reign, knowing it to be forged:
And afterwards the ſaid Sir <hi>William Read</hi> exhibited the
ſaid Bill againſt the ſaid <hi>Boothes,</hi> and others, for forging
another Writing under Seal, dated the 20th of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
in the ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas Greſham's</hi> Name, purporting a
Deed of Feoffment of all his Lands (except certain) to
Sir <hi>Rowland Heyward,</hi> and <hi>Edward Hoogen</hi> and their
Heirs, in effect, to the uſe of <hi>Markham</hi> the younger, and
his Heirs, and for publiſhing the ſame, knowing it to be
forged, was the Bill exhibited. And upon hearing this
Cauſe this Term, theſe Doubts were moved upon the Star.
1 <hi>Eliz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. If one who is Convict of publication of a Deed of
eoffment or Rent-charge, knowing the ſame to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57645:93"/>
again at another day forge another Deed of Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Rent-charge, if he be within the Caſe of Felony
within the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t: which Doubt ariſeth upon theſe words
(<hi>eſt-ſoons</hi>) committed again any of the ſaid Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>2. The ſecond Doubt was, If a man commit two For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries,
one in 37 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the other, in 38 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and he is
firſt convicted of the laſt, if he may now be impeached
for the firſt.</p>
               <p>3. When <hi>Roger Booth</hi> was Convict in 38 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
is charged with a new Forgery, in 37 <hi>Eliz.</hi> If the
Witneſſes moving in truth, that it was forged after the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Conviction, if the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> hath Juriſdiction of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p>4. When <hi>Cuthbert Booth,</hi> who was never Convict of
Forgery before, if in truth the Forgery was done, and ſo
proved in 38 <hi>Eliz.</hi> If he might be convicted upon this
Bill, becauſe the Forgery is alleadged before it was
done.</p>
               <p>1, 2. To the firſt and ſecond Doubts, It was reſolved
by the two Chief Juſtices, and Chief Baron; That if
one be Convict of Forgery, or publiſhing any Writing
concerning Free-hold, &amp;c. within the firſt Branch, or
concerning Intereſt or Term of Years, &amp;c. in the ſecond
Branch, and be convicted, if afterwards he offend, either
againſt the firſt Branch or ſecond, that the ſame is Felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
As if he forge a Writing concerning an Intereſt for
Years within the ſecond Branch, and be convicted; and
after he forgeth a Charter of Feoffment within the firſt
Branch, <hi>et e converſo,</hi> that is Felony, by expreſs words
of the Act. But if one forge a Writing in 37 <hi>Eliz</hi> and
after he forge another in 38 <hi>Eliz.</hi> yet it is not Felony,
though he forge many Writings one after another; for
the Forgery, &amp;c. which is Felony by the Act, ought to
be after Conviction, or Condemnation, of a former Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="tcp:57645:93"/>
3. As to the third Doubt, It was Reſolved, That the
Allegation of the time, by the Plaintiff in the Bill, ſhall
not alter the Offence, but ſhall give to the Court Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction:
But if it appear, that the Forgery or Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was after the Sentence, then the Court ſhall ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe.</p>
               <p>4. As to the laſt Point, It was Reſolved, That the time
of the Forgery is not material, if it be committed before
the exhibiting the Bill. But if the date of ſuch Writing,
ſuppoſed to be Forged, had been miſtaken, there the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
could not be condemned of a Deed of another
Date.</p>

               <head> The Caſe of Sewers.</head>
               <p>The Caſe was, There was a Cawſey or Milſtank of
Stone in the River of <hi>Dee,</hi> and in the City of <hi>Cheſter;</hi>
which Cawſey, before the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the
firſt, was Erected for the neceſſary maintenance of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Mills at the end of the ſaid Cawſey. And now a
certain <hi>Decree</hi> was made by certain Commiſſioners of
Sewers, for a Breach to be made by ten Poles in length,
in the ſaid Cawſey: and if by any <hi>Decree</hi> of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners,
by force of any Statute, any breach may be
made in that Cawſey, was the Queſtion: And it was
referred, by Letters of the Lords of the Privy-Councel, to
the Chief Juſtices, and Chief Baron; who, upon hearing
of Councel Learned, at divers dayes, and good Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
had of all Statutes of Sewers, and Conferences

by inhanſing Mills, Mill-ſtanks, &amp;c. made before <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the firſt's Reign, that Act appoints them to be
ſurveyed; and ſuch as were found to be much inhanſed,
to be corrected. None of which Acts, extend to the Caſe
in queſtion: for that Cawſey was erected before <hi>Edw.</hi> 1.
and never inhanced ſince the Erection. And the 12 <hi>H.</hi> 4.

none of the ſaid Statutes are repealed, as to the Caſe in

Mills, &amp;c. and to correct, repair, or pull down, &amp;c. as
cauſe requireth, according to their diſcretions, &amp;c. after
the effect of the Statute, made before the 1. of <hi>March,</hi> 23
<hi>H.</hi> 8. By which appears, that the Commiſſioners diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
was limited, <hi>viz.</hi> to proceed according to the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
and Ordinances before made, &amp;c. And the ſaid
Act provides, That all and every Statute, Act, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

4. are not contrary to the ſaid Act, nor repealed: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways

and that the Authority given by the Commiſſion of

                  <hi>Richard</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> with the Biſhops of
<hi>London, Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> and <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> divers Doctors of
the Civil and Canon-Law; as Dr. <hi>Dun,</hi> Judge of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
Dr. <hi>Rennet</hi> Judge of the <hi>Prerogative,</hi> Dr. <hi>James,</hi> Dr.
<hi>Martin,</hi> and others, came and attended the King at <hi>White-Hall,</hi>
the <hi>Thurſday, Friday,</hi> and <hi>Saturday,</hi> after <hi>Eaſter</hi> Term,
in the Councel-Chamber; where the Chief Juſtice, and
I my ſelf, <hi>Daniel</hi> Judge of the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> and <hi>Williams</hi>
Judge of the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> by the King's Command at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
alſo; where the King, aſſiſted with his Privy-Councel,
all ſitting at the Councel-Table, ſpake as a moſt
Gracious Soveraign, to this effect: As He would not
ſuffer any Novelties or Innovations in his Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
Eccleſiaſtical and Temporal; ſo he would not have
any the Laws, which had Judicial Allowances, in the
Times of his Predeceſſors Kings of <hi>England</hi> to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.
And foraſmuch as Contentions between the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
and Eccleſiaſtical Courts, cannot but breed great
Inconvenience to the Subjects, eſpecially when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
ariſeth upon the Juriſdiction of his Ordinary
Courts of Juſtice; And becauſe he was the Head of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
immediately under God, and knowing what hurt
may grow to his Subjects, when the Juriſdiction of his
Courts are drawn in queſtion; He thought it concerned
him, as a King, to hear the Controverſies between the
Biſhops and Clergy, and the Judges of his Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and to take Order, that the one do not encroach
upon the other. And He ſaid, The onely Queſtion then
to be diſputed was, If a Parſon or Vicar of a Pariſh, ſues
one of his Pariſh in the Spiritual Court for Tythes, in
Kind, or Layfee; and the Defendant alleadgeth a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom
or Preſcription, <hi>de modo Decimandi;</hi> if that Cuſtom
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57645:95"/>
or Preſcription ſhall be tryed and determined before the
the Judge Eccleſiaſtical, where the Suit is begun, or a
Prohibition lyeth to try the ſame by the Common-Law.
And the King directed, that We who were Judges, ſhould
declare the Reaſons of our Proceedings, and what Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities
in the Law we had to warrant our Proceedings, in
granting Prohibitions in Caſes <hi>de modo Decimandi.</hi> But
the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> kneeled before the King,
and deſired he would hear him, and others, provided to
ſpeak in the Caſe, for the good of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
And the Archbiſhop inveighed chiefly againſt two
things.</p>
               <p>1. That a <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> ſhould be tryed by a Jury,
becauſe they themſelves claim more or leſs <hi>modum Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandi;</hi>
ſo as, in effect, they were Tryers in their own
Cauſe, or in the like Caſes.</p>
               <p>2. He inveighed much the precipitate and haſty Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als
by Juries; and after him Dr. <hi>Bennet</hi> made a large
Invection againſt Prohibitions, <hi>in cauſis Eccleſiaſticis;</hi> and
he made five Reaſons, why they ſhould try <hi>modum Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. The firſt and principal was out of the <hi>Regiſter, fol.</hi>
58. <hi>quia non eſt conſonans rationi, quod cognitio acceſſarii in

principal cauſe is Right of Tythes, and the Plea of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus
Decimandi</hi> ſounds in ſatisfaction of Tythes; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Conuzance of the Original Cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the Right
of Tythes belonging to them, the Conuzance of the Bar
of Tythes belonged to them. And whereas it is ſaid in
the ſecond Part of my Reports, in the Biſhop of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi>
Caſe; and 8 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 14. that they would not accept
of any Plea, in diſcharge of Tythes, in the Spirituall
Court; he ſaid, they would allow ſuch Pleas, and had
allowed them, being duly proved before them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:57645:95"/>
2. There was great inconveniency, that Lay-men
ſhould be Tryers of their own Cuſtoms, for they ſhall be
Jurors in their own Cauſe.</p>
               <p>3. That the Cuſtom of <hi>Modo Decimandi</hi> is of Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Juriſdiction, for it is a manner of Tything, and all
manner of Tything belongs to Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction;
and therefore he ſaid, if the Right of Tythes be of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Conuzance, and the Satisfaction alſo for
them of the ſame Juriſdiction, the ſame ſhall be tryed in
the Eccleſiaſtical Court.</p>
               <p>4. In the Prohibitions of <hi>Modus Decimandi,</hi> Averment
is taken, that though the Plaintiff in the Prohibition offer
to prove <hi>Modum Decimandi,</hi> the Eccleſiaſtical Court doth
refuſe to allow it: but he ſaid they would allow ſuch
Plea; and therefore, <hi>Ceſſante cauſa ceſſabit et effectus,</hi> and
no Prohibition ſhall lye.</p>
               <p>5. He ſaid, he can ſhew many Conſultations granted
in the Cauſe, <hi>de modo Decimandi,</hi> and a Conſultation is of
greater force then a Prohibition. And <hi>Bacon</hi> Sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
General, being (as is ſaid) aſſigned with the Clergy
by the King, ſaid leſs then Dr. <hi>Benn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And We being commanded to proceed, all that was
ſaid by Us the Judges, was to this effect: That the Tryal
<hi>de modo Decimandi,</hi> ought to be by the Common-Law,
by a Jury of Twelve Men, it appears in three Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:
<list>
                     <item>1. By the Common-Law.</item>
                     <item>2. By Acts of Parliament.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:57645:96"/>
3. By infinite Judgments, and Judicial Proceedings,
long times paſt without interruption.</p>
               <p>But firſt, it is to ſee what is a <hi>Modus Decimandi:</hi> Now
<hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> is, when Lands, Tenements, or Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taments,
have been given to the Parſon and his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,
or an Annual certain Sum, or other Profit, alwayes
time out of mind, in full Satisfaction and Diſcharge of
all Tythes in kind in ſuch a place: and ſuch manner of
Tything is now confeſſed by the other Party, to be a good
Bar of Tythes in Kind.</p>
               <p>1. That <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> ſhall be tryed by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law;
and therefore put that which is the moſt
common Caſe: That the Lord of the Mannor of <hi>Dale</hi>
preſcribes to give to the Parſon 40 <hi>s.</hi> yearly, in full Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
and Diſcharge of all Tythes, growing within
the ſaid Mannor of <hi>Dale,</hi> at the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter.</hi> The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſues the Lord of the Mannor of <hi>Dale</hi> for his Tythes,
of his Mannor in kind, and he in Bar preſcribes <hi>ut ſupra.</hi>
The Queſtion is, If the Lord of the Mannor of <hi>Dale</hi> may
upon that have a Prohibition; for if the Prohibition lye,
then the Eccleſiaſtical Court ought not to try it.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt, The Law of <hi>England</hi> is divided into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law,
Statute, and Cuſtoms; and therefore the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms
of <hi>England</hi> are to be tryed by the Tryal, which the
Law of <hi>England</hi> appoints.</p>
               <p>2. Preſcriptions by the Law of the Holy Church, and
by the Common-Law, differ in the times of Limitation:
and therefore Preſcriptions and Cuſtoms of <hi>England,</hi> ſhall
be tryed by the Common-Law. See 20 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>f.</hi> 17. 19 <hi>E.</hi>
3. <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> 28. The Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> brought a
Writ of Annuity againſt the Arch-Deacon of <hi>Surrey,</hi> and
declared, That he and his Succeſſours were ſeized by the
Hands of the Defendant, by Title of Preſcription; and
the Defendant demanded Judgment, iſ the Court would
hold Juriſdiction between Spiritual Perſons, &amp;c. <hi>Stone</hi>
Juſtice, <hi>Be aſsured, That upon Title of Preſcription, we will
there hold Juriſdiction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:57645:97"/>
And upon that, <hi>Wilby</hi> Chief Juſtice, gave the Rule,
<hi>Anſwer:</hi> Upon which it follows, That if a <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi>
which is an Annual ſum for Tythes by Prerſciption, comes
in Debate between Spiritual Perſons, that the ſame ſhall
be tryed here. 32 <hi>E.</hi> 2. <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> 26. There was a
Vicar who had onely Tythes and Oblations, and an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot
claimed an Annuity or Penſion of him by Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and it was adjudged, That the ſame Preſcription,
though between Spiritual Perſons, ſhall be tryed here.

               <p>2. Secondly, By Acts of Parliament.</p>
               <p>1. The ſaid Act of <hi>Circumſpecte agatis,</hi> that gives power
to the Eccleſiaſtical Judge, to ſue for Tythes firſt due in
Kind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or by Cuſtom, <hi>viz. Modus Decimandi.</hi> So as by that
Act, though the Yearly Sum ſoundeth in the Temporalty,
which was paid by Cuſtom, in diſcharge of Tythes; yet
becauſe the ſame comes in the place of Tythes, and by
Conſtitution, the Tythes are changed into Money, and
the Parſon hath not any remedy for the ſame, which is
the <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> at the Common-Law. For that
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57645:97"/>
cauſe the Act is clear, that the ſame was a Doubt at the
Common-Law. And the Stat. of <hi>Articuli Cleri, cap.</hi> 1. If
that corporal puniſhment be changed into <hi>poenam pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niariam;</hi>
for that Pain, Suit lyes in the Spiritual Court:
For which, ſee <hi>Mich.</hi> 8 <hi>H.</hi> 3. <hi>Rot.</hi> 6. <hi>in Theſaur.</hi> And
by the 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. It is Enacted, That all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of the Realm, according to the Eccleſiaſtical Law,
and after the laudable Uſages and Cuſtom of the Pariſh,
&amp;c. ſhall yield and pay his Tythes, &amp;c. and for ſubſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
thereof, may, by due proceſs, &amp;c. compell him to
yield the Duties: and with that, in effect, agrees 32 <hi>H.</hi>
8. <hi>c.</hi> 7. By the 2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 13. it is Enacted, That all
the Kings Subjects ſhall henceforth truly and juſtly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Fraud, &amp;c. divide &amp;c. and pay all their Predial Tythes
in their proper kind as they riſe, &amp;c. And always, when
an Act of Parl. commands or prohibits any Court, be it
Spiritual or Temporal, to do any thing Spiritual or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
if the Stat. be not obtained, a Prohibition lyes; as
upon the Stat. <hi>de artic. ſuper chart. cap.</hi> 4. <hi>Quod communio
Placita non tenentur in Scaccario.</hi> A Prohibition lyes to

2. <hi>H.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 3. and upon that Stat. 4 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 37. the Caſe was;
<hi>Peirce Peckham</hi> took Letters of Adminiſtration, of the
Goods of <hi>Roſe Brown,</hi> of the Biſhop of <hi>London:</hi> afterwards
<hi>T. T.</hi> ſued to <hi>Thomas</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to have Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57645:98"/>
committed to him, becauſe <hi>Roſe Brown</hi> had
Goods in his Dioceſs, and they were granted to him. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>T. T.</hi> Libelled in the Court of the <hi>Arches</hi> againſt
<hi>Peirce Peckham,</hi> to repeal his Adminiſtration; and <hi>Peirce
Peckham,</hi> according to the Stat. prayed a Copy to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel,
and could not have it; and thereupon he ſued a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition,
and upon that an Attachment. And there <hi>Catesby</hi>
Sergeant moved, that a Prohibition did not lye for two
Cauſes.</p>
               <p>1. The Statute ſays, that the Libel ſhall be deliver'd,
but not that the Plea ſhall ſurceaſe.</p>
               <p>2. The Statute is not intended of Matter meerly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual:
And there <hi>Danby</hi> Chief Juſtice; <hi>If you will not
deliver the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bel, according to the Statute, you do wrong,
which wrong is a Temporal matter, and puniſhable at the
Common-Law, and therefore the party ſhall have a ſpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition.</hi>
And always after the ſaid Act, in every Term,
throughout the Reigns of <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>Q. Mary,</hi> and <hi>Q. Eliz.</hi> to
this day, Prohibitions have been granted in <hi>Modo Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mando,</hi>
and Judgments given upon many of them, without
any contradiction; and accordingly all the Judges Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
7 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>Dyer</hi> 79. <hi>Et contemporanea expoſitio eſt optima
et fortiſſima in lege, et minime mutanda ſunt quae certam
habuerunt interpretationem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. As to the firſt, <hi>Objectio,</hi> That the Plea of <hi>Modus
Decimandi,</hi> is but acceſſary to the Right of Tythes; It
was Reſolved, That the ſame was of no force, for three
Cauſes:</p>
               <p>1. In this Caſe, admitting there is a <hi>Modus Decima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,</hi>
then by the Cuſtom; and by the Act 2. <hi>E.</hi> 6. and the
other Acts, the Tythes in Kind are extinct and diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for one and the ſame Land cannot be ſubject to two
manner of Tythes; but the <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> is all the
Tythe with which the Land is chargeable: and it ſhall
be intended, that the <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> began at firſt by
reall Compoſition: So as in this Caſe, there is neither
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57645:98"/>
Principal. nor Acceſſary, but an Identity of the ſame
things.</p>
               <p>2. The Stat. 2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. being a Prohibition in it ſelf, and
that in the Negative; If the Eccleſiaſtical Judge doth
againſt it, a Prohibition lyes; as appeareth clearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>3. Though the Rule be general, yet it appears by the
Regiſter it ſelf, that a <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> is out of it: for
there is a Prohibition, <hi>in cauſa modi Decimandi,</hi> when
Lands are given in ſatisfaction of the Tythes.</p>
               <p>2. As to the ſecond Objection, It was Anſwered and
Reſolved, That that was from, or out of the Queſtion; for
<hi>ſtatus Quaeſtionis non eſt deliberativusſed judicialis:</hi> for
convenient, or inconvenient, is not the Queſtion, but what
the Law is.</p>
               <p>3. As to the third Objection, it was anſwered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved;
Firſt, That <hi>ſatisfactio pecuniaria</hi> of it ſelf, is Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral:
But becauſe the Parſon hath not remedy, <hi>pro
modo Decimandi,</hi> at Common; by force of the Acts cited
before he might ſue, <hi>pro modo Decimandi,</hi> in the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Court: But that proves not, That if he ſue for
Tythes in Kind, which are utterly extinct, &amp;c. that upon
the Plea <hi>de modo Decimandi,</hi> that a Prohibition ſhould not
lye: for the contrary appears, without all queſtion, by
what hath been ſaid before: See alſo 12 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 24. <hi>b.</hi> 39
<hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 22 <hi>E.</hi> 4. <hi>Conſultation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the Objection, That Averment is taken of the
Refuſal of the Plea, of <hi>Modus Decimandi;</hi> It was anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and Reſolved, That the ſame is of no force, for divers
Cauſes.</p>
               <p>1. It is onely to inforce the Contempt.</p>
               <p>2. If the Spiritual Court ought to have the Tryal, <hi>de
modo Decimandi,</hi> then the refuſing to accept ſuch a Plea,
ſhould give cauſe of Appeal not of Prohibition.</p>
               <p>3. From the beginning of the Law, no Iſſue was ever
taken upon the Refuſal of the Plea, <hi>in cauſa modi Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandi,</hi>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:57645:99"/>
nor any Conſultation granted to them; becauſe
they did not refuſe, but allow the Plea.</p>
               <p>4. The Refuſal is no part of the matter iſſuable or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
in the Plea; and therefore the <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> is
proved by two Witneſſes, according to the Stat. 2 <hi>E.</hi> 6.
<hi>cap.</hi> 13. and not the Refuſal; which proves, the <hi>Modus
Decimandi</hi> is onely the Matter of Suggeſtion, not the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal.</p>
               <p>5. All the ſaid five Matters of diſcharge of Tythes,
mentioned in the ſaid Act of 2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. ought to be proved
by two Witneſſes, and ſo have been always, ſince the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the ſaid Act. And therefore it clearly inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that Prohibitions ſhould be granted in ſuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
               <p>6. Though they would allow, <hi>bona fide de modo Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandi,</hi>
without Refuſal; yet if the Parſon ſue there for
Tythes in Kind, when the <hi>Modus</hi> is proved, (the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
expreſly forbidden by that Act 2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. 13.) a Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
lyes, though the <hi>Modus</hi> be Spiritual; as appears by
the Book, 4 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 37.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, the third day of the Debate of this Caſe
before the King, Dr. <hi>Bennet,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Martin,</hi> had reſerved
divers Conſultations granted <hi>in cauſa modi Decimandi,</hi>
thinking they might work upon the King's Opinion:
and thereupon they ſaid, That Conſultations were the
Judgments of Courts had upon Deliberations; whereas
Prohibitions were onely granted upon Surmiſes. And they
ſhewed 4 Preſidents.</p>
               <p>1. One, where three joyntly ſued a Prohibition, in the
Caſe of <hi>modo Decimandi;</hi> and the Conſultation ſaith, <hi>Pro
co quod ſuggeſtio materiaque in eodem content a minus ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
in lege exiſtit, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Another, <hi>in cauſa modi Decimandi,</hi> to be paid to the
Parſon or Vicar.</p>
               <p>3. Where the Parſon ſued for Tythes in Kind, and
the Defendant alleadged, <hi>modus Decimandi,</hi> to be paid to
the Vicar.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:57645:99"/>
4. Where the Parſon Libelled for Tythe-Wooll, and
the Defendant alleadged a Cuſtom to reap Corn, and
make it into Sheaves, and ſet forth the Tenth Sheave at
his Charges: and ſo of Hay, to ſever it from the Nine
Cocks at his Charge, in full ſatisfaction of the Tythes of
the Corn, Hay, and Wooll.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwer'd, and humbly defir'd the King to
obſerve, theſe were reſerved for the laſt and center-point
of their Proof. And herein theſe things may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</p>
               <p>1. That the Kings Courts do them Juſtice, when with
their Conſciences and Oaths they can.</p>
               <p>2. That all the ſaid Caſes are clear, in the Judgment
of thoſe who are Learned in the Laws, that Conſultation
ought by the Law to be granted.</p>
               <p>1. For as to the firſt Preſident, the Caſe upon their
own ſhewing, is, Three Perſons joyned in one Prohibition,
for three ſeveral parcels of Land, each having a ſeveral
ſort of Tything; and their Intereſts being ſeveral, they
could not joyn; and therefore a Conſultation was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>2. To the ſecond, the manner of Tything was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged
to be paid to the Parſon or Vicar, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.</p>
               <p>3. To the third, The <hi>Modus</hi> never came in Debate,
but whether the Tythes did belong to the Parſon or Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car:
which being between two Spiritual Perſons, the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Court ſhall have Juriſdiction; and therewith
agrees 38 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 6.</p>
               <p>4. To the laſt, The ſame was upon the matter of a
Cuſtom of a <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> for Wooll: for to pay the
Tythe of Corn or Hay in Kind, in ſatisfaction of Corn,
Hay, and Wooll, cannot be a ſatisfaction for the Wooll:
for the other two were due of common right.</p>
               <p>The Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> anſwer'd, That the words of the
Conſultation were, <hi>Quod ſuggeſtio praedicta mattriaque in
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:57645:100"/>
eadem cohtenta minus ſufficiens in lege exiſtit, &amp;c.</hi> So as <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria</hi>
cannot be refer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed to Form, and therefore it ought
to extend to the <hi>Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>us Decimandi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I anſwer'd, That when the Matter is inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
or uncertainly alleadged, the Matter it ſelf faileth;
and though the Matter be in truth ſufficient, yet if it
were inſufficiently alleadged, the Plea wanteth matter.
Then the Lord Treaſurer ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d, he wondered they would
produce things that made more againſt them, then any
thing had been ſaid.</p>
               <p>And when the King relyed, upon the Prohibition in
the Regiſter, when Land is given in diſcharge of Tythes,
the Lord Chancellor ſaid, <hi>That was not like this Caſe;</hi>
For there by the Gift of the Land, the Tythes were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged;
but in the Caſe <hi>de modo Decimandi,</hi> an Annual
Sum is paid; yet the Land remains charged, and is to be
diſcharged by Plea, <hi>de modo Decim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ndi.</hi> All which I utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
denied: For the Land was as abſolutely diſcharged of
the Tythes, <hi>in caſu de modo Decimandi,</hi> as where Lands
are given. All which the King heard with patience, and
the Chancellor anſwer'd no more.</p>
               <p>After the King, with all his Councel, had for 3 dayes
together, heard the Allegations on both ſides, he ſaid, He
would maintain the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and that his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
ſhould have as great reſpect from all his Subjects, as
their Predeceſſors. And for the Matter, he ſaid, for any
thing had been ſaid on the Clergies part, he was not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied;
and adviſed Us the Judges to confer among our
ſelves, and that nothing be encroached in the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Juriſd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

what cauſe it was ſo ſaid in the ſaid Books. To which I
anſwer'd, That it appears in <hi>Linwood,</hi> who was Dean of
the <hi>Arches,</hi> and a Profound Canoniſt, who wrote in <hi>Henry</hi>
the Sixth's time, in his Title, <hi>De decimis cap: Quoniam

diminutione.</hi> And in the Gloſs it is ſaid, <hi>Quod conſuetudo
de non Decimando aut de non bene decimando non valet.</hi> And
that being written by ſo great a Canoniſt, was the cauſe
of the ſaid Saying in 8 <hi>E.</hi> 4. that they would not allow
the ſaid Plea <hi>de modo decimandi.</hi> And it ſeemed to the
King, that that Book was a good cauſe for them in <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi>
the Fourth's time, to ſay as they had ſaid. But I
ſaid, I did not rely thereon, but on the Grounds afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, The King ſaid, that the High Commiſſion
ought not to meddle with any thing, but that which is
enormous, and which the Law cannot puniſh; as Hereſie,
Schiſm, Inceſt, and the like great Offences: And the King
thought that two High-Commiſſions, for either Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
one, ſhould be ſufficient for all <hi>England,</hi> and no
more.</p>

               <p>The Attorney of the <hi>Court of Wards</hi> moved the two

man ſeized of Lands in Fee-ſimple, covenants for the

that he will ſtand ſeized of them to the uſe of
himſelf for life, and after to the uſe of his eldeſt Son,

of the body of the Son, and afterwards the Father
dyeth, and after the Son takes a Wife and dyeth; if the
Wife ſhall take an Eſtate for Life. And it was <hi>Reſolved,</hi>
by the ſaid two Chief Juſtices, and Chief Baron, That
the Wife ſhould take well enough; being within the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:57645:102"/>
conſideration, which was for the advancement of his Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity;
and without a Wife the Son cannot have Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Secondly, It was Reſolved, that the Eſtate of the
Son ſhall ſupport the uſe to the Defendant; and when
the Contingent happeneth, the Eſtate of the Son ſhall
be changed, according to the Limitation, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Son
and the Woman, and the Heirs of the Body of the Son.

               <p>1. And firſt, it was objected, Here was no dying ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
found by Office, and therefore the Office ſhall be
inſufficient: But to that, it was Reſolved, That by this
Office the King was not intitled by the Common-Law;
for then a dying ſeized was neceſſary: But this Office is
to be maintained upon the Stat. 32 and 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. by force
of which no dying ſeized is neceſſary; and ſo it was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved

               </p>
               <p>2. The ſecond Objection was, It doth not appear that

for the Husband and Wife had aliened the ſame to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and then no primer ſeizin ſhall be, as is agreed in
<hi>Binghams</hi> Caſe. And to that it was Reſolved, That the
Office was ſufficient, <hi>prima facie,</hi> for the King, becauſe it
is a thing collateral, and no point of the Writ: And if

ſuch Alienation be, the ſame ſhall come in of the other
part of the Alienee, by a <hi>Monſtrans de droit.</hi> And the Caſe

<hi>Richard Hawkins,</hi> Vice-Admiral of the County of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>von,</hi>
and was charged, that one <hi>William Hull,</hi> and others,
were notorious Pyrates upon the High Seas, and ſhewed
in certain what Pyracy they had committed: That the
ſaid Sir <hi>Richard Hawkins</hi> knowing the ſame, did receive
them, and abet, &amp; comfort them, and for Bribes ſuffered
them to be diſcharged: And what Offence that was, the
Court referred to the conſideration of the two Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices,
and Chief Baron, who heard Councel of both ſides
divers days at <hi>Sergeants</hi> Inne: And it was Reſolved by
them,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:57645:104"/>
1. That the Admirals, by the Common-Law, ought
not to meddle with any thing done within the Realm,
but onely with things done upon the Sea: and that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth
fully by the 13 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. and therewith agrees
2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 11. and 15 <hi>H.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3. So alſo, 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. <hi>c.</hi> 6. 5 <hi>Eliz.

399. See <hi>Plo. Com.</hi> 37 <hi>b.</hi> 2 <hi>R.</hi> 3. 12. 30 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 6. by <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. It was Reſolved, That the Statutes are to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
of a Power to hold Plea, not of a Power to award
Execution: for notwithſtanding the ſaid Statutes, the
Judge of the Admiralty may do Execution within the
Body of the County: And therefore 19 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 7. the Caſe
was <hi>W. T.</hi> at <hi>Southwark,</hi> affirmed a Plaint of Treſpaſs in
the Admiralty againſt <hi>J. B.</hi> of a Treſpaſs done upon the
High-Sea: Whereupon <hi>J. B.</hi> was cited to appear at the
common day next enſuing; at which day, the ſaid <hi>J. B.</hi>
made default: And according to the uſage of the Court,
the ſaid <hi>J. B.</hi> was amerced to 20 Marks: Whereupon
Command was made to <hi>P.</hi> as Miniſter of the ſaid Court,
to take the Goods of the ſaid J. B. to make agreement with
the aforeſaid W. T. by force of which, he, for the ſaid 20
Marks, took 5 Cowes, and 100 Sheep, in Execution for
the ſaid Money, in the County of <hi>Ieiceſter.</hi> And there it is
holden by <hi>Newton,</hi> and the whole Court, That the Statutes
reſtrain the power of the Court of Admiralty, to hold
Plea of a thing done within the body of the County; but
they do not reſtrain the Execution of the ſame Court to
be ſerved upon the Lands. In which Caſe, theſe Points
were Reſolved,</p>
               <p>1. Though the Court of Admiralty is not a Court of
Record (ſee <hi>Brooks Error.</hi> 77. <hi>acc.</hi>) yet by Cuſtom of the
Court they may amerce the Defendant for his default, by
their diſcretion.</p>
               <p>2. That they may make Execution for the ſame, of
the Goods of the Defendant, <hi>in corpore Comitatus;</hi> and if
he have not Goods, may arreſt his Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:57645:104"/>
But the great queſtion between them was, If a man
commit Pyracy upon the Sea, and one knowing thereof,
receive and comfort the Defendant in the Body of the
County, if the Admiral, and other the Commiſſioners by
the Act 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 16. may proceed by Indictment and
Conviction againſt the Receiver and Abetter, the Offence
of the Acceſſary having his beginning within the Body of
the County. And it was Reſolved by them, That ſuch
a Receiver and an Abetter, by the Common-Law, could
not be indicted and convicted; becauſe the Common-Law
cannot take Cognizance of the Original Offence,
being done out of the Juriſdiction of the Common-Law;
and where it cannot puniſh the Principal, it cannot pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
the Acceſſary: And therefore <hi>Coke</hi> Chief Juſtice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
to them a Caſe which was in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> 28 <hi>Eliz.</hi>
where <hi>Butler</hi> and others, upon the Sea, next to the Town
of <hi>Iayſtoff,</hi> robbed divers of the Queens Subjects of their
Goods, which they brought into <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and there were
apprehended and brought before Me, then a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of Peace in the ſame County, and upon Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they confeſſed a cruel and barbarous Pyracy, and
that the Goods then in their Cuſtody, were part of the
Goods which they had ſo robbed: And I was of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that in that Caſe it could not be Felony puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by the Common-Law, becauſe the Original Act was
not offence, whereof the Common-Law taketh know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
and then the bringing them into the County, could
not make the ſame Felony puniſhable by our Law: Yet
I committed them to the Gaol, untill the coming of the
Juſtices of the Aſſizes: And at the next Aſſizes, the
Opinion of <hi>Wray</hi> Chief Juſtice, and <hi>Perian</hi> Juſtices of
Aſſize, was, agreeing with Me <hi>ut ſupra:</hi> and thereupon
they were committed to Sir <hi>Robert Southwel,</hi> then Vice-Admiral

Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> by the ſame Indenture, covenants, to make
further Aſſurance to the ſaid <hi>John</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> &amp;c. and
Livery and Seizin was deliver'd accordingly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Sammes</hi> the Father dyeth, <hi>George Sammes</hi> his Son
and Heir within Age; the Queſtion was, Whether <hi>Geo.
Sammes</hi> ſhould be in Ward to the King, or no: And in
this Caſe three Points were Reſolved,</p>
               <p>1. Foraſmuch, as <hi>George</hi> was not named in the Premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
he cannot take by the <hi>Habendum;</hi> and the Livery,
according to the Indenture, gives nothing to <hi>George,</hi> it
being to him as void: but though the Feoffment be
good onely to <hi>John</hi> and his Heirs, yet the uſe limited to
<hi>John</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> and their Heirs, is good.</p>
               <p>2. If the Eſtate had been conveyed to <hi>John</hi> and his
Heirs, by the Releaſe, &amp;c. as it may well be to a Tenant
by Copy of Court Roll, the uſe limited to them is
good.</p>
               <p>3. But the third was of greater doubt, If in this Caſe
the Father and Son were Joint-Tenants, or Tenants in
common: And it was Reſolved, That they were Joint-Tenants,
and that the Son in the Caſe at Bar ſhould
have the ſaid <hi>Grange</hi> by the Survivor: for if at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law
<hi>A.</hi> had been enfeoffed, to the uſe of him &amp; B. and
their Heirs, though that he was onely ſeized of the Land,
the uſe was jointly to A. and B. for a uſe ſhall not be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended
or extinct by a ſole Seizin, or joint Seizin of the
Land: and therefore, if A. and B. be enfeoffed to the uſe
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:57645:106"/>
of A. and his Heirs; And A. dyeth, the entire uſe ſhall
deſcend to his Heirs; as appears 13 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 6. in <hi>Stoner's</hi>
Caſe; and by the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. Of
Uſes.</p>
               <p>And when it was ſaid, that the Eſtate of the Land which
the Father hath in it, as to the moiety of the uſe, which
he himſelf hath, ſhall not be deveſted out of him. To that
it was Anſwered and Reſolved, That, that ſhall well be:
for if a man make a Feoffment in Fee to one, to the uſe
of him and the Heirs of his body, in this Caſe, for the
benefit of the Iſſue, the <hi>Statute of Uſes</hi> deveſts the Eſtate
veſted in him by Common-Law, and executes the ſame
in himſelf by force of the Statute: And it is to be known,
that an Uſe of Land (which is but a pernency of Profits)
is no new thing, but part of that which the Owner of
the Land had: and therefore if Tenant in <hi>Borough-Engliſh,</hi>
or a man ſeized on the part of his Mother, make
a Feoffment to another without conſideration, the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Son in the one caſe, and the Heir, on the part of the
Mother, on the other, ſhall have the uſe, as they ſhould
have the Land it ſelf, if no Feoffment had been made; as
it is holden 5 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 7. See 4 and 5 <hi>P.</hi> and <hi>M. Dyer</hi> 163.
See <hi>Fenwick</hi> and <hi>Milford's</hi> Caſe, <hi>Trin.</hi> 31 <hi>Eliz.</hi> So in 28
<hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dyer</hi> 11. the Lord <hi>Roſſes</hi> Caſe, 13 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 6. by <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So in the Caſe at Bar, the Uſe limited to the Feoffee,
and another, is not any new thing, but the pernancy of the
old profits of the Land, which may well be limited to the
Feoffee and another jointly. But if the uſe had been onely
limited to the Feoffee and his Heirs there, becauſe there
is not any Limitation to anothers perſon, <hi>nec in praeſenti
nec in futuro,</hi> he ſhall be in by force of the Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>And it was Reſolved, That Joint-Tenants might be
ſeized to an uſe, though they come to it at ſeveral times:
as if a man make a Feoffment in Fee to the uſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and to ſuch a Woman which he ſhall after marry,
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:57645:106"/>
for term of their lives, or in tail, or in fee; in this Caſe,
if he marry a Wife after, ſhe ſhall take jointly with him,
though they take the uſe at ſeveral times. See 17 <hi>Eliz.
Dyer</hi> 340. but otherwiſe it is of Eſtates, which paſs by the
Common-Law; as 24 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>Joynder in Action</hi> 10. If a
Grant be made by Deed to one man for life, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to the right Heirs of A. and B. in Fee, and A. hath
Iſſue and dyeth, and afterwards B. hath Iſſue and dyeth,
and then Tenant for Life dyeth; in that caſe, the Heirs
of A. and B. are not Joynt-Tenants; becauſe by the death
of A. the remainder, as to one moiety, veſted in his Heir,
and by the death of B. the other moiety veſted in his
Heir at ſeveral times.</p>
               <p>And upon the whole matter, it was Reſolved, That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
in the principal Uſe, the Father and Son were
Joint-Tenants by the Original Purchaſe, that the Sonne
having the Land by Survivor, ſhould not be in Ward, and
accordingly it was ſo Decreed.</p>

three parts to be divided: and yet it was good as well in

that there remains but one part undivided. But when any
Demand is of other parts in other form, there he ought

a Book of Sorcery in his Mayl; and he was brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

made him ſwear never after to commit Sorcery, and he
was ſent to Priſon; and the Head and Book were burn'd

               <p>The antient Law was, as by <hi>Britton</hi> appears, that who

if one call another Witch, an Action will not lye: But
if one ſay, <hi>She is a Witch, and hath bewitched ſuch a one to

               <p>Sir <hi>John Fitz,</hi> and <hi>Bridget</hi> his Wife, being Tenants for
life, of a Tenement called <hi>Ramſhams,</hi> the remainder to
Sir <hi>John Fitz</hi> in Tail, the remainder to <hi>Bridget</hi> in Tail,
the reverſion to Sir <hi>John</hi> and his Heirs: Sir <hi>John,</hi> and
<hi>Bridget</hi> his Wife, by Indenture demiſed the ſaid Tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to <hi>William Sprey</hi> for divers years yet to come (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
all Trees of Timber, Oakes and Aſhes, and liberty
to carry them away) rendring Rent. And afterwards
Sir <hi>John</hi> dyed, having Iſſue <hi>Mary</hi> his Daughter, now
Wife of Sir <hi>Allen Percy</hi> Knight; and afterwards the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:57645:108"/>
ſaid <hi>William Sprey</hi> demiſed the ſame Tenement to Sir <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi>
for 7 years. The Queſtion was, Whether Sir <hi>Allen</hi>
having the immediate Inheritance in right of his Wife,
expectant upon the Eſtate for the life of <hi>Bridget;</hi> and alſo
having the Poſſeſſion of the ſaid Demiſe, might cut down
the Timber Trees, Oakes, and Aſhes? And it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
he might well do it: for it was Reſolved in <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi>
Caſe, in the 5th Part of my Reports, That if Leſſee
for years or life, aſſigns over his term or Eſtate to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
excepting the Mines or the Trees, &amp;c. that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
is void. But it was anſwered and Reſolved, by
the two Chief Juſtices, and the Chief Baron, that in the
Caſe at Bar, the Exception was good without queſtion;
becauſe he who hath the Inheritance, joyns in the Leaſe
with the Leſſee for life. And it was further Reſolved;
That if Tenant for life Leaſeth for years, excepting the
Timber Trees, the ſame is lawfully and wiſely done; for
otherwiſe, if the Leſſee or Aſſignee cut down the Trees,
the Tenant for Life ſhould be puniſhed in Waſt, and
ſhould not have any remedy againſt the Leſſee for years.
But when Tenant for life upon his Leaſe excepteth the
Trees, if they be cut down by the Leſſor, the Leſſee or
Aſſignee ſhall have an Action of Treſpaſs; <hi>Quare vi &amp;
armis,</hi> and ſhall recover Damages according to his loſs,
And this Case is not like the Caſe of <hi>Sanders;</hi> for there
the Leſſee aſſigned over his whole Intereſt, and therefore
could not except the Mines, Trees, &amp;c. But when Tenant
for life leaſes for years, except the Timber Trees, the
ſame remaineth yet annexed to his Free-hold, and he may
command the Leſſee to take them for neceſſary Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his Houſes. And in the ſaid Caſe of <hi>Sanders,</hi> a
Judgment is cited between <hi>Foſter</hi> and <hi>Miles</hi> Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs,

that Waſt in ſuch Caſe ſhall be brought againſt the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignee:
But in this Caſe, without queſtion, Waſt lyeth
againſt Tenant for life, and ſo there is a difference.</p>

of <hi>Edward Hulme,</hi> then in Ward of the King, as of his

<hi>Robert Male,</hi> by another Office it was found, that <hi>Richard</hi>

as of his Dutchy, &amp;c. his Heir within age: Whereupon
<hi>Richard Hulme,</hi> Cozen and Heir of the ſaid <hi>Richard Hulme,</hi>
preferred a Bill to be admitted, to traverſe the Office
found 4 <hi>Jac. Regis.</hi> And the Queſtion was, Whether the

or if that the ſaid <hi>Hulme</hi> ſhould be firſt driven to Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
that.</p>
               <p>And it was objected, That he ought firſt to traverſe the

To which it was Anſwered and Reſolved, by the two
Chief Juſtices, and Chief Baron, and Court of Wards;
That the finding of an Office is not any Eſtoppel, for
that is but an Inqueſt of Office, and the party grieved
ſhall have a Traverſe to it: But when an Office is found
falſly, that Land is holden of the King by Knights Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<hi>in capite,</hi> or of the King himſelf in Socage, if the
Heir fue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h a general Livery, it is holden 46 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 12. by
<hi>Mowbray</hi> and <hi>Perſey,</hi> that he ſhall not after adde, that the
Land is not holden of the King: But that is not any E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoppel
to the Heir himſelf, and ſhall not conclude his
Heir: for ſo ſaith <hi>Mowbray</hi> himſelf expreſly, 44 <hi>Aſs. pl.</hi>
35. See 1 H. 4. 6. <hi>b.</hi> So 33 H. 6. 7. And there is no
Book that ſaith, that the Eſtoppel ſhall endure longer
than his life; but that is to be intended of a general Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very;
but a ſpecial Livery ſhall not conclude one. And
if a Jury find falſly in a Tenure of the King, the Lord;
of whom the Land is holden, may traverſe that Office.
Or if Land be holden of the King in Socage, &amp;c. the
Heir may traverſe the laſt Office; for by that he is
grieved, and he ſhall not be driven to traverſe the firſt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
And when the Father ſues Livery and dyes, the
Concluſion is executed, and paſt, as is aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>And note, there is a ſpecial Livery, but that proceeds
of the King's Grace, and is not the Suit of the Heir; and
the King may grant it either at full age, before <hi>aetate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banda,</hi>
or to the Heir within age, as appears 21 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 40.
And then is general, and ſhall not comprehend any Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure,
as the ſeveral Livery doth; and therefore it is not
any Eſtoppel without queſtion: See the 33 H. 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 22.
23 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 177.</p>
               <p>It was alſo Reſolved in this Caſe, that the Office of
35 H. 8. was not traverſable; for his own Traverſe ſhall
prove, that the King had cauſe to have Wardſhip by

Lords of Parliament, who not having leiſure to examine

Baron, and the reſt of the Judges and Barons; and it was
unanimouſly by them all Reſolved, That no ſuch Proceſs
could or ought to be made, neither for the Damages, nor
for the Coſts given to the Plaintiff, the Court having no
ſuch power, but onely to keep the Defendant in Priſon till

make no Proceſs to levy it; but they eſtreat it into the

&amp;c. for &amp;c. as to the ſaid two Acres of Land, with the
Appurtenances, in Law or not, the Jury pray the Advice
of the Court.</p>
               <p>Note, This Plea began <hi>Trin.</hi> 5 <hi>Jac. Rot.</hi> 1405. and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Argument at the Bar and Bench,</p>
               <p>1. It was Reſolved, by the whole Court, That it
ought to be found againſt the Defendant, who had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed
the Preſcription: For though all the two Yard-Lands
had been demiſed for years, yet the Preſcription
made by the Plaintiff is true: But if he would take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of the matter in Law, he ought (confeſſing the
Common) to have pleaded the ſaid Leaſe; but when he
traverſeth the Preſcription, he cannot give the ſame in
Evidence.</p>

that the Common, during the Leaſe for years, is not
ſuſpended or diſcharged; for each of them ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

which &amp;c. ſhall not be ſurcharged.</p>
               <p>3. Reſolved, That Common appendant to Land, is
as much as to ſay for Cattel leuant and couchant upon
the Land, in which &amp;c.</p>
               <p>4. There is no difference, when the Preſcription is for
Cattel leuant and couchant, and for a certain numb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r of
Cattel leuant and couchant: But when the Preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is for Common appurtenant to Land, there a certain
number of the Cattel ought to be expreſſed, which are
intended by the Law to be leuant and couchant.</p>

the aforeſaid Meſſuage of the ſaid <hi>Richard Heydon,</hi>
was in decay, &amp;c. upon which the Defendant demurred
in Law.</p>
               <p>The Caſe was often argued at Bar; and now this
Term it was argued at the Bench by the Juſtices, and
therein theſe Points were reſolved.</p>
               <p>1. That the firſt part of the Cuſtom was abſurd and
repugnant, but it extends not to the Caſe; for the laſt
part of the Cuſtom, which concerns the cutting down of
the Trees, concerns the Point in queſtion; and ſo the firſt
part of the Cuſtom is not material. And when it was
objected, that the pleading that the Meſſuage of the
Plaintiff was in decay, was too general, as appears by the
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57645:113"/>
Book, 10 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 3. To that it was anſwered by <hi>Cook</hi> Chief
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uſtice, That the ſaid Book proved the pleading in the
Caſe at Bar was certain enough; and therewith agrees
7 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 38. 34 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 17.</p>
               <p>2. It was Reſolved, That in this Caſe, without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
there needs not to alleadge more certainty; for the
Copyholder doth not here take it according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom;
but the Lord of the Mannor cuts it down, and
preventeth the Copyholder of his benefit; and therefore
he needeth not to ſhew any decay at all, but onely for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
of Damages: for the Lord does the wrong,
when he cuts down the Tree which ſhould ſerve for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations.</p>
               <p>3. It was Reſolved, That of Common-Right, as a
thing incident to the Grant, the Copyholder may take
Houſe-bote, Hedge-bote, and Plough-bote, upon his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py-hold,
<hi>Quia conceſſo uno, conceduntur omnia ſine quibus
id conſiſtere non poteſt:</hi> And with this agrees, 9 <hi>H.</hi> 4.
<hi>Waſt</hi> 59. But the ſame may be reſtrained by Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome.</p>
               <p>4. It was Reſolved, That the Lord cannot take all
the Timber-Trees, but he ought to have ſufficient for
Reparation of the Cuſtomary Houſes, and for Plough-bote,
&amp;c. for otherwiſe great Depopulation will follow.
And it is to be underſtood, that <hi>Bote</hi> being on old <hi>Saxon</hi>

               <p>Firſt, <hi>compenſatio criminis,</hi> as <hi>Frithbote</hi> ſignifies to be

Caſtlebote, Parkbote,</hi> &amp;c. And it is to be known,
that <hi>Bote</hi> and <hi>Eſtovers</hi> are all one. And <hi>Eſtover</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived

Houſebote,</hi> and <hi>Hedgebote.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. It was Reſolved, That the Copyholder ſhall have a
general Action of Treſpaſs againſt his Lord, <hi>Quare clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum
fregit &amp; arborem ſuam ſuccidit:</hi> For Cuſtome hath
fixed it to his Eſtate againſt his Lord. And the Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder,
in this Caſe, hath as great an Intereſt in the
Timber Trees, as he hath in his Meſſuage which he holds
by Copy. And if the Lord break or deſtroy the Houſe,

choſe accordingly: The Parſon, by colour of a new

Officiall of the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
him, upon the Point of right Election, and for
other Cauſes: And upon that, it was moved at the Bar, to
have a Prohibition: And upon hearing of Dr. <hi>Newman,</hi>
and himſelf, and his Councel, a Prohibition was granted
by the whole Court; becauſe the Party choſen is a meer
Temporal Man, And the means of chooſing him, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Cuſtome is alſo meerly Temporal: So as the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial

may diſplace him. And this Office is like that of
a Church-Warden, who though they be choſen for two
years; yet, for cauſe, they may diſplace them: as is held
in 26 H. 8. 5. And though the Execution of the Office,
concerneth <hi>Divine Service,</hi> yet the Office it ſelf is meer
Temporal. See 3 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Annuity</hi> 30. 18 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 27. And
it is to be known, that the deprivation of a man of a
Temporal Office or Place, is a Temporal Thing. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
