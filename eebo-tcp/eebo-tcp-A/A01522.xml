            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the right honorable his sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular good Lord the Lord Gray of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, Knight of the most honorable order of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, George Gascoigne Esquire wisheth long life <hi>with encrease of honour, according to</hi> his great worthinesse.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Ight honorable, noble, and my singular good Lorde: if mine abilitie were any way correspondent too the iust desires of my hart, I should yet thinke al the same vnable to deserue the least parte of your goodnesse: in that you haue alwayes deygned with chearefull looke to regarde me, with affabylitie to heare me, with exceeding curtesy to vse me, with graue aduice to directe mee, with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant loue to care for me, and with assured assistance to protect me. All which when I do reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, yet it stirreth in me an exceeding zeale to deserue it: and that zeale begetteth bashefull dreade too performe it. The dread is ended in dolours, and yet those dolours receiue the very same affection, whiche firste moued in mee the desire to honour and esteme you. For whiles I bewayle mine own vnworthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and therewithal do set before mine eyes the lost time of my youth mispent, I seeme to see a farre of (for my comfort) the high and triumphant vertue called <hi>Magnanimitie,</hi> acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panied with industrious dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. The first doth encourage my faynted harte, and the seconde doth beginne (already) to employ my vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, for (ahlas my good Lorde) were not the cordial of these two pretious Spice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the corrosyue of care woulde quickely confounde me.</p>
            <p>I haue misgouerned my youth, I confesse it: what shall I do then? shall I yelde to mysery as a iust plague apointed for my portion? Magnanimitie saith no, and Industrye seemeth to be of the very same opinion.</p>
            <p>I am derided, suspected, accused, and condemned: yea more than that, I am ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously reiected when I proffer amendes for my harme. Should I therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spayre? shall I yeelde vnto iellosie? or drowne my dayes in idlenesse, bycause their beginning was bathed in wantonnesse? Surely (my Lord) the Magnanimitie of a noble minde will not suffer me, and the delightfulnesse of dilygence doth vtterly forbydde me.</p>
            <p>Shal I grudge to be reproued for that which I haue done in deede, when the
<pb facs="tcp:3024:3"/>
sting of Emulation spared not to touche the worthy <hi>Scipio</hi> with most vntrue sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myses? Yea <hi>Themistocles</hi> when he had deliuered al Greece from the huge host of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> was yet by his vnkinde citizens of Athens expulsed from his owne, and constrained to seeke fauour in the sight of his late professed enemie, But the Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimitie of their mindes was such, as neither could aduersytie ouercome them, nor yet the iniurious dealing of other men coulde kindle in their brestes any least sparke of desire, to seeke any vnhonorable reuenge.</p>
            <p>I haue loytred (my lorde) I confesse, I haue lien streaking me (like a lubber) when the sunne did shine, and now I striue al in vaine to loade the carte when it raineth. I regarded not my comelynes in the Maymoone of my youth, and yet now I stand prinking me in the glasse, when the crowes foote is growen vnder mine eye. But what?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aristotle</hi> spent his youth very ryotously, &amp; <hi>Plato</hi> (by your leaue) in twenty of his youthful yeares, was no lesse addicted to delight in amorous verse, than hee was after in his age painful to write good precepts of moral Phylosophy. VVhat shoulde I speake of Cato, who was o<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>de before he learned lattine letters, and yet became one of the greatest Oratours of his time? These examples are sufficient to proue that by industrie and diligence any perfection may be attained, and by true Magnanimitie all aduersitie are easye to be endured. And to that ende (my verie good lorde) I do here presume thus rudely to rehearse them. For as I can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to confesse the lightnesse wherewith I haue bene (in times past) worthie to be burdened, so would I be gladde, if nowe when I am otherwise bent, my better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuors might be accepted. But (alas my lorde) I am not onely enforced stil to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie on my shoulders the crosse of my carelesnesse, but there withall I am also put to the plonge, too prouide (<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uen nowe) weapons wherewith I maye defende all heauy frownes, deepe suspects, and dangerous detractions. And I finde my selfe so feeble, and so vnable to endure that combat, as (were not the cordialles before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearsed) I should either cast down<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But neither wil Magnanimitie suffer me to become vnhonest, nor yet can In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrie see me sinke in idlenesse.</p>
            <p>For I haue learned in sacred scriptures to heape coles vppon the heade of mine enemie, by honest dealing: and our sauiour himselfe hath encoraged me, saying that I shal lacke neither workes nor seruice, although it were noone dayes before I came into the Market place.</p>
            <p>These things I say (my singular good lorde) do renewe in my troubled minde the same affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which first moued me to honor you, nothing doubting but <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

fauorable eyes will vouchsafe to beholde me as I am, and neuer be so curious as to enquire what I haue bene.</p>
            <p>And in ful hope therof, I haue presumed to present your honour with this Satyre written without rime, but I truste not without reason. And what soeuer it bee, I do humbly dedicate it vnto your honorable name, beseeching the same too accept it with as gratious regarde, as you haue in times past bene accustomed too beholde my trauailes. And (my good Lorde) though the skorneful do mocke me for a time, yet in the ende I hope to giue them al a rybbe of roste for their paynes. And when the vertuous shall perceiue indeede how I am occupied, then shall detraction be no lesse ashamed to haue falsely accused me, than light credence shal haue cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent his rashe conceypt: and Grauitie the iudge shal not be abashed to cancel the sentence vniustly pronounced in my condemnation. In meane while I remaine amongst my bookes here at my poore house in VValkamstowe, where I praye daylie for speedy aduauncement, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall prosperitie of your good Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
