            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A DESCRIPTION OF THE ISLAND AND CITY OF CANDIA. By E. G. Serjeant at Arms.</head>
            <figure>
               <p>This Table ſheweth
wheareabout and how
this Iland Candia lyeth
betwixt Europe &amp; Aſia
and the Venetian &amp; Turke</p>
            </figure>
            <p>THE Commonweal of <hi>Venice,</hi> for the Greatneſs,
Nobility, Riches, goodly Pallaces, Scituation, and
other good parts, is admirable among all the
Towns of <hi>Europe;</hi> the ſcituation thereof being ſo
commodious for all things, as it may be held rather a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
than a humane work. And although many Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monweals
have exceeded it in greatneſs of Empire, in
multitudes of people, and in ſtate; yet there was never any
Town ſo ſtrangely ſcituated nor ſo ſecurely: But not to
detain you here, we ſhall proceed to give you a ſhort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the Iſland of <hi>Creta</hi> or of <hi>Candia.</hi> The Iſland of
<hi>Creta</hi> (anciently ſo called, or of <hi>Candia,</hi> as we now call it)
hath in length, from Eaſt to Weſt about ſixty <hi>French</hi>
Leagues, and not above ſixteen Leagues in breadth, it is
about a hundred and twenty Leagues in circuit, going about
by Sea: Upon the Weſt it hath the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea, to the
North that which carries the name of the <hi>Cretiſh</hi> Sea, to
the South the <hi>Lybick,</hi> and to the Eaſt the <hi>Carpathien,</hi> as <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limey,</hi>
deſcribes it. It was famous in old time for that it
had an hundred Towns, and therefore the Greek Poet called
it <hi>Hecatompolis:</hi> The ſcituation is more Eaſternly than that
of the Countrey of <hi>Morea,</hi> lying betwixt the Counties of
<hi>Artica</hi> and that of <hi>Cyren,</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> being but two dayes
journey by Sea from either Province at this day, according
to <hi>Belonus:</hi> There are but three Towns of note in this
Iſland, that is, <hi>Candia</hi> (in old time <hi>Matium)</hi> the chief of
this Iſland, whereof it takes her name, then <hi>Canea</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<hi>Sidon</hi> and <hi>Rhetinno;</hi> it hath a port which is not very
commodious, but thoſe of <hi>Cania</hi> and <hi>Candia</hi> are very ſafe;
in this Iſland are the Rivers of <hi>Melipotame, Scaſin, Cladile,
Epiſidome, Giffo,</hi> and <hi>Divotro,</hi> towards the North <hi>Populiar,</hi>
towards the Weſt <hi>Lymans,</hi> and to the South the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
of note are <hi>Ida</hi> called by the inhabitants <hi>Philloriti
Luci,</hi> which <hi>Pliny</hi> calls <hi>Caduſſi,</hi> and at this day <hi>Madure,</hi> and
<hi>Dacte,</hi> which they call <hi>Setrie.</hi> This Iſland ſeems to be
made to command all <hi>Greece,</hi> for that it lies not far from
<hi>Peloponneſus,</hi> and may command all the Sea towards <hi>Greece,</hi>
it was ſold to the <hi>Venetians</hi> by the Marquis of <hi>Montſerrat</hi>
in the year, 1194.</p>
            <p>This Iſland of <hi>Candia,</hi> although it be hilly, yet it hath
many Valleys that are fruitful, and yield much, for that
they are watered with many Fountains, Brooks, and Rivers:
Moreover, there is abundance of excellent Wine, which
they of the Countrey call <hi>Malmſey,</hi> they have ſtore of Milk
and Honey, and ſufficient of fleſh, ſo as they anciently did
call it, the happy Iſland: There grows the goodlieſt Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
Trees that can be ſeen; and all other kinds of Timber
fit for the building of Ships. There is not any hurtful or
venemous Beaſts except <hi>Phalanges,</hi> which are like unto Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,

they have long Horns like unto a wild Goat, and are not
much bigger, yet they have as much fleſh as a Stag, the hair
is fallow and ſhort, but they carry a great black Beard; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
they take them, when they are very little, to breed
them up amongſt their troops of Goats, and to have of
their race, as well for their beauty as for the taſte of their
fleſh, his Horns are very great in reſpect of his Body, but
he is ſo nimble as he out-runs any Stag, neither can the dogs
follow him by the ſcent, for that he will wind the Huntſmen about a hundred paces off,
ſo as when they would take him, they tie tame Goats upon the paſſages of the Mountain,
were the <hi>Bouceſlaine</hi> ſmelling them, he goes unto them, and ſtaying there, the Huntſmen
have opportunity to ſtrike him, but if the wound be not mortal, although the Dart be poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd
and remains in his Body, yet he cures himſelf eating the Herb, which the Simpliſt calls
<hi>Dixamum,</hi> the which is good againſt poiſon, as <hi>Dioſcordies</hi> ſaith, for that the only ſcent of it
kills Serpents and other venomous Beaſts.</p>
            <p>This Iſland did flouriſh in former times, when as her King did hold all <hi>Greece</hi> in awe, the
<hi>Cretoies</hi> were held the beſt Archers in the World, they invented the Pyrick Daunce, in the
time of their King <hi>Cydon,</hi> they were all armed when as they danced, and it hath been ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in this Iſland, as the Peſants daunce on Holy-dayes in the hotteſt time of Summer,
not caring for any ſhadow, and with their Arms, that is to ſay, a Bow, a Sheaf of Arrows,
and a Sword, as if without it they could have no good grace in dancing: The moſt famous
Nations among the Grecians have taken their Laws from the Candiots, as <hi>Plato</hi> doth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
eſpecially the <hi>Laced<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>monians,</hi> took their practice from them, they had one which did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn
that all their children ſhould be bred up in publick, to the end that the poor having the
like breeding to the rich, they ſhall have no cauſe to envy them. And it was alſo ordained by the
Laws, that to inure their children not to fear any thing, but to bear all things with patience,
they ſhould be accuſtomed to Arms; and to make them contemn heat, cold, hunger, and
thirſt, they ſhould carry a Bow and Arrows in dancing, and their apparel ſhould be ſit for
War, all the Candiots were forced to marry, being of age, and then they were diſmiſs'd
from the company of young men: they did not preſently conduct their Wives home to their
Houſes, but they attended until they wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

married indifferently one with another. There was a Law, that if the brother did mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
his ſiſter, he ſhould make her a Dowry of half his Patrimony: To raviſh a Maid was more
eſteemed, than if he had obtained his deſire with free conſent. In the end, Candiots lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their ancient Diſcipline, became Pirats, having been always powerful at Sea, and had
carried themſelves ſo valiantly, as they had vanquiſhed them of <hi>Attica,</hi> and led Arms fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
into <hi>Sicily.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Candia</hi> are by nature apt and ready to do evil: the Ancients give them
the title of Lyers: They are ſubtil and courteous, and do hardly endure labour, neither do
they learn any Art or Science perfectly: It is true, that at this day, as <hi>Belonus</hi> ſaith, they do
practice from their Youth, according to their ancient cuſtom, to ſhoot, wherein they excel
even the Turks themſelves, and they are active and valiant at Sea, as much as they have been
in former times.</p>
            <p>This City of <hi>Candia</hi> is exceeding ſtrong, both by Art and Scituation; The Turks being
poſſeſt of the whole Iſland and Maſter of the field, attempted to win the <hi>Metropolis Candia</hi> alſo.
Therefore <hi>Anno</hi> 1648. he beſieged it, and after many furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
onſets, being ſtill beaten, at laſt he was forced to give
over, but raiſed another Town or new <hi>Candia</hi> at three
miles diſtance, which is the place of the Grand Viſiers
Reſidence, by which means the City is blockt up by Land;
and now again the laſt year 1667. and this preſent 1668.
he lyeth before it, uſing all the extremities poſſible to win
it, and that he might the better effect it, the grand Viſier
has demoliſhed the afore mentioned Town that they built,
called new <hi>Candia,</hi> that ſo his Souldiers might be the
more reſolute in the ſiege, having no place for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Candia</hi> is a large and famous City, ſcituated on a
Plain by the Sea ſide, having a goodly Haven for Ships,
and a fair Arſenal with 36. Gallies, it is very populous
and rich, inhabited partly by <hi>Venetians,</hi> and partly by the
natural <hi>Candians,</hi> it is exceeding ſtrong, and in Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
daily guarded with 2000. Souldiers. The Women
wear breeches as men do, and boots after the ſame manner,
and their upper Coats no longer then the middle of their
Thighs; The better ſort of people go after the <hi>Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>
faſhion. <hi>Canea</hi> is the ſecond City of this Realm, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
populous, well walled and fortified, equallizing
any ſtrength in <hi>Europe,</hi> it hath a large Caſtle, where a
<hi>Venetian</hi> Sub-Governour doth reſide; Then is <hi>Retimo,</hi>
this hath no Wall but a Caſtle. The fourth is, <hi>Sithia</hi>
alſo head of a Province. The Iſland of it ſelf is inacceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for ſhips, but in theſe four Cities, and ſome few
other places well gauarded to hinder it. The Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Commodities of this Iſland, are the Excellent
Wines, eſpecially the <hi>Maluaſy,</hi> and the beſt Sugar in the
World, which we commonly call Sugar-Candy, then Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
wood, of which there are vaſt Mountains full, which
they uſe for all things, Joyners and Carpenters work,
Timber for buildings, Maſts for Gallies, the reſt for fuel.
As for variety &amp; plenty of all ſorts of excellent rare fruits,
it doth ſurpaſs all other adjacent Iſlands, eſpecially the
Valley of <hi>Suda,</hi> a ſecond <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> the Grain is brought
from other parts; Of wild and hurtful beaſts, as Lions,
Bears, Wolves, &amp;c. there is none; neither any venomous
Vermine, yet there is a ſort of Serpents, but their ſting
not hurtful, on the contrary their women are ſaid to be ſo
venemous, that being angry, if they ſcratch or bite a man,
and ſetch bloud, without preſent remedy he muſt die. The
Natives are of the Grecian Church, except the <hi>Venetians</hi>
and ſtrangers.</p>
