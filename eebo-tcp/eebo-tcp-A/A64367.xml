            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN obedience to Your commands, I have made this Discourse Publick; and I humbly offer it to Your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable acceptance. There is need of such candour in reference to the manner of handling this Argument; it being so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
<pb facs="tcp:63399:3"/>
to speak discreetly of Discretion, and with perfect Charity, of the lavish Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of it. But, touching the Argument it self, I forbėar to use any Apologie; it being (as I think) agreeable enough to the design of a <hi>Spittle-</hi>Sermon.</p>
            <p>There is another branch of Charity which equally needeth Prudence, and is as necessary to be consider'd, though, at that time and place, it was not a subject so proper for me. I mean, that Discreet Charity which moderates our Censures. It is too common a practice to leap from bare Report to uncharitable Opinion and unchristian Language; without staying at all in the mid-way, to examine the grounds of ordinary Fame. And so, by publick Clamour, and by private Discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, as by Winds aloft and Earthquakes beneath, the frame of Civil Polity is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered. And it may be taken up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, as a Proverb of Reproach,
<pb facs="tcp:63399:3"/>
That <hi>England</hi> is a Creature which, if it finds no other way of dying, will kill it self with jealousie and fretfulness. We make <hi>others</hi> our Enemies, by thinking them to be so, and by giving scandalous Characters of them, before we truly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand their merits. And I hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thank God, that I have found, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, so much of good temper and real Piety in many Men, upon whom rashness had fixed names of Infamy. God grant that we may, on all hands, avoid Extreams; and, by the voice of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Charity, call back that Blessed Peace which hath seemed to be flying from us. No man can desire this with greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of affection and sincerity, than,</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSAL. cxii. part of verse 5.</bibl>
               <q>A Good man—will guide his Affairs with Discretion.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <hi>PRudence</hi> (if we discourse concerning it with propriety) is not so much a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct and particular virtue, as the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Governess</hi> of all the virtues. It con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidereth the <hi>scope</hi> at which we aim; it chuseth honest and useful <hi>means,</hi> and fitteth them to their end; it conducteth them, in due manner, in their operation; it adjusteth all the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of humane life.</p>
            <p>It is true, there may be something done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it which is, in its nature, <hi>good:</hi> but, even then, it cannot be said to be performed <hi>well</hi> and correctly, and with the approbation of right reason. For to affirm that <hi>chance</hi> is wise, is to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63399:5"/>
say most absurdly of it, that it is not it self.</p>
            <p>The useful influence of <hi>discretion</hi> appeareth, plainly, in all the Affairs of a Christian man. But I shall only give an instance of it in the exercise of Charity; whether it be when we use <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,</hi> or administer <hi>Alms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In using of Reproof,</hi> it is <hi>Discretion</hi> which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>what Arcana</hi> of Vice are unfit to be exposed; at <hi>what seasons</hi> men in fault are in the fittest tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for Advice; <hi>what</hi> are those <hi>happy hours</hi> in which they are softest, and most receptive of any virtuous impression; by <hi>what steps</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees we ought to proceed; <hi>when</hi> we are to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the modesty, or to dash the confidence, of offenders; <hi>how</hi> we ought to proportion the degree of our passion to the quality of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; lest, by equal vehemence against in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity and presumption, we hinder the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from discerning whether the crime be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, or unworthy of favour.</p>
            <p>Then, <hi>in the Administration of Alms,</hi> we are guilty of unprofitable (not to say, very injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) prosuseness, whensoever <hi>Prudence</hi> is not the <hi>dispenser</hi> of them. Alms are call'd, in <hi>Holy writ,</hi> by the venerable Name of Religious <hi>Offerings.</hi> But, whatsoever the Altar be at which they are presented without <hi>Discretion,</hi> they are so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63399:5"/>
               <hi>Sacrifices without Salt.</hi> Wherefore, in the Text, <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Prudence</hi> meet together in this excellent character of a bountiful Person; <hi>A good man [sheweth favour, and lendeth, and] will guide his Affairs with Discretion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You perceive, by this Introduction, what is like to be my present Argument, that particular one <hi>of Discretion in giving Alms,</hi> and not that of Charity in general, in praise of which so much hath been, already, said by others, and so very accurately; that they have, in effect, exhausted the subject.</p>
            <p>And, indeed, it appears to every judicious Christian so excellent and so necessary a duty; that it is difficult for such a one to prevent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement when he hears it put in form of Query by the <hi>Schools,</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">T. Aquin. Sum. 2<hi rend="sup">•</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">•</hi> q 23. Art. 3. <hi>utrum Charitas sit virtus?</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>whether or no Charity be a virtue?</hi> I mean this of such a man as is not well acquainted with their usual way of tying knots upon the plainest things to shew their dexterity in the solution.</p>
            <p>Now, in pursuance of my intended subject, I shall,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the first place,</hi> inquire who that <hi>good man</hi> is who is described in the Text, as a person, at the same time <hi>wise,</hi> and <hi>liberal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:63399:6"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I shall show, in general, that <hi>bounty</hi> ought, evermore, to be govern'd by <hi>Discretion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I shall lay, before your considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, those particular measures of Religious Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence by which a man, truly and wisely Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, does <hi>guide his Affairs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> I shall earnestly move this Audience (if need there be of importunity in so good a cause and in a Christian Assembly) both to <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> it self, and to the <hi>prudence</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Under this Exhortation, I shall direct to such <hi>means</hi> as are proper to be used towards the attainment of this great perfection of discreet and rational bounty.</p>
            <p>And all this, to the intent that they whom God hath prosper'd, may be perswaded both to <hi>communicate,</hi> and to do it in such prudent and profitable manner; that the Providence of God may be glorify'd by mans wise and good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of its liberality to him; that the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick needs may be the more conveniently sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd; and that men of equal discretion and Charity may <hi>lay up for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, and, at length, lay hold of eternal life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am (by the order I have prescrib'd to my self) to inquire, in</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:63399:6"/>
               <hi>The first place,</hi> Who that <hi>good man</hi> is, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of whose Charity and prudence, not only the Text, but this whole Psalm, is penn'd. And it is manifest by these following words <hi>[he sheweth favour and lendeth]</hi> that by such a one is meant, a man of gentle temper and generous disposition; a Man neither <hi>rigid</hi> nor <hi>selfish:</hi> one to whom belong the good qualities of the Zone we live in, which is temperate and fruitful. So that this kind of <hi>goodness</hi> consisteth in two very valuable things, <hi>sweetness of nature, and largeness of heart.</hi> And both these generally go together. For it is with the soul of man as it is with the parts of matter, which, the lesser they are, they are always the harder, and the more inflexible.</p>
            <p>And, First, This <hi>Good man</hi> excelleth in sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and goodness of Nature. By which I mean not that easiness of temper which renders him apt to be seduced, but that humanity of dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition which prepares him with inclination to do good. The Hebrew word which, in our Translation, is rendred <hi>[a good man]</hi> is, in that of the <hi>Seventy,</hi> interpreted by <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This <hi>Good man</hi> excelleth in largeness of heart. <hi>Vir bonus</hi> is, here, <hi>Vir utilis.</hi> A Good man is a man useful to his Generation. In this sence the Law is said <note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 7. 12.</note> to be, not only <hi>holy</hi> [or a Rule separate from the immoral measures which the World lives by] and <hi>just</hi> [that is, a Rule of right reason] but <hi>Good</hi> also; that is, a Rule useful and serviceable to all who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it. A Good man is not injurious, nor so much as rigorously just; but (like the best of Beings of whom <hi>Plato</hi> said, that there was no Envy or narrowness in him) diffusive of Good will and favour towards all mankind. He is One who do's <note n="d" place="margin">S. Matt. 5. 47.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, some excellent thing;  something more generously good than others, who (like the Publicans) are wont rather to <hi>exchange,</hi> them to <hi>do,</hi> good Turns. When the <hi>Jews</hi> personate such a one, they introduce him speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this proverb: <hi>That which is thine is, for me, still thy propertie; and that which is mine is thine also.</hi> This is He for whom some other man of an upright intention, but of much meaner capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie to serve his Age, would (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 5. 7.</note> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth) <hi>even dare to die.</hi> And certainly he who, when there is apparent hazard, sacrificeth his own less profitable life, to preserve the more useful one of some <hi>light of Israel,</hi> some man who is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63399:7"/>
and publick good, some <hi>Hero</hi> in generous virtue; can never fall an inglorious victim in the Eys of God or any virtuous beholder.</p>
            <p>Having, thus, shew'd you who this <hi>Good man</hi> is who is so well spoken of in the Text, and pray'd (as I hope we All do very heartily) that God would add thousands and ten thousands to his Order; I come to prove,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Second place,</hi> that the goodness of such a mans nature, and the bounty of his heart and hand, are always to be govern'd by Discretion. And this is a truth which needs no laborious proof.</p>
            <p>For, <hi>First,</hi> without Prudence, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of charity cannot be measur'd and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited with judicious <note n="f" place="margin">LXX. <gap reason="foreign">

For there are Givers of different abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and there are Receivers, whose needs are different, and whose merits are unequal. And the same kind of Alms, and the same mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures are not, at all times, proper to be given or received by the same Persons. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it is necessary that men be furnish'd with discretion, by which they may be qualifi'd for the due oeconomie <note n="g" place="margin">LXX. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:63399:8"/>
Now <hi>(Secondly)</hi> unless our charity be judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously weigh'd and proportion'd, three great inconveniencies will attend it.</p>
            <p>For <hi>(First)</hi> without such judicious estimation, our charity will be, often, ridiculous and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. Hence many have given humorous Alms, and conceited Legacies, and have made Statutes relishing of Monkish Caprice; and written <hi>Folly,</hi> in very legible Characters, upon the Front of their Foundations. Hence some, whose devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ha's had Ignorance for its mother, have built Two Churches in the same <hi>Inclosure</hi> in a small village; endamaging the publick service of God by dividing the Assemblie. Hence a man otherwise of no ordinary Figure in the English Chronicle <note n="i" place="margin">K. Edg. vid. Hist. of Ref. part 1. p. 22.</note> is said to have resolved to increase his sorty seven <hi>Monasteries</hi> to the number of fifty, because that was the number of the year of <hi>Jubilee.</hi> A reason derived from no deeper Cause than the pleasure which the chime of those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing numbers made in his weak imagination.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly;</hi> unless discretion adjusteth and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioneth our Alms, we shall do less good with them than is in our power. Good is to be done; and every degree of Good is Good. And though a man is not obliged to do always that which, in the abstracted speculation of it,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63399:8"/>
is best; yet true Philosophy, as well as Theology seemeh to assure us, that <hi>there are no such things as moral Counse's which are not also Commands:</hi> And that every man is bound to do whatsoever is, in his Circumstances, best to be done by him, and easily understood by him to be best. Now how dwelleth the love of God and goodness in that man, who, when he may do a <hi>greater good,</hi> do's irrationally chuse to do a <hi>less,</hi> by a careless and indiscriminating liberality? There is a certain proportion of needs and provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in the world. And, in many places of it, the provisions do scarce ballance the needs. Wherefore, there is cogent reason for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of our charity go as far as it can. And if it is to be done for the best, discretion must guide us in the performance. For what harvest can we expect from that precious seed of Alms, which is either thrown on an heap, or scattered at all adventures, and in such sort, that the cultivated land is not distinguished from the fallow and unbroken; that the very Rocks and high ways are sown; and that the Birds of Prey devour that which ought to have been committed to the good ground, and to have taken root there, and to have sprung up, from thence, for the sustenance of mans indigent Nature?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:63399:9"/>
I should offend against manifest Truth, if I should say, that no good can be done by indiscreet Alms: For good is, often, done by prodiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity it self, of which some spoils, accidentally, fall to the lot of the wise and sober. But, <hi>the greater the Prudence, the greater the good.</hi> And it is with Alms as with Estates, where half of the Riches do's consist in the discretion of the Owner. A Judicious man will serve more good purposes with a few pence, than an imprudent man with a great number of Talents. We see it daily, that a competent Revenue, by good manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Gods blessing, supporteth divers Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and divers Societies founded by charity, in very decent and comfortable manner. And S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> 
               <note n="k" place="margin">S. Chrys. Hom. 67. in S. Matt.</note> reporteth concerning the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> that, in his time, the small Revenue of it, well apply'd, did maintain three thousand Widows and Virgins, besides the Clergy, the Prisoners, the Strangers, the Lepers. On the other hand, it cannot escape our most negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent observation, that there are some single Persons [some did I say? Would God they were to be easily numbred] who have had greater abundance in this world than many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and publick Foundations. And yet, by Imprudence, and by Vice (Vice which is the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63399:9"/>
greatest of Indiscretions) they have consumed the very stock, and outliv'd all but the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable remembrance of their former plenty, and the brutish abuse of it. And yet, it may be, they never did one worthy deed, nor enjoy'd themselves as men of Honour and Condition, nor satisfi'd many of the most just debts: I mean such as have been due either for faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful service, or for the conveniences of life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> without judicious estimation, we shall do real dammage with our Alms; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the method of the All-wise God (which the same God forbid) we shall <hi>bring Evil out of Good.</hi> By not distinguishing aright of Persons, and their needs; we shall encourage vice, instead of relieving Poverty. We shall imitate sensual men who consider only the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the vitiated appetite, and not the real health of the body. For instead of support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, according to our power and skill, the just ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities of the Common-wealth; we shall be tempted, by giving ear to the clamorous im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of the idle, the vicious, the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical, to nourish the Plagues and feed the diseases of it.</p>
            <p>By these means we shall make it necessary for us to repeat this Prayer (for which there is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63399:10"/>
too frequent cause; though, I fear, it is very rarely used) <q>God forgive me the prodigality of my Alms; God forgive me the indiscretion of my Charity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The necessity of Prudence in conjunction with Charity being thus, in more general man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, evinced; I proceed,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the third place,</hi> To the more particular rules and measures of Religious discretion in relation to Alms. These (I think) may be comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under the two following <hi>heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Discretion in providing, preserving, or increasing wealth; that we may have ability to do good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Discretion in dispensing of it, that we may do it to the best and wisest purposes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The prudence of Charity consisteth in that discretion which provideth, preserveth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth wealth, that we may have ability to do good, and to continue in doing of it, and in bearing of such useful fruit until we die. It is the care of every good man to be rather helpful than burthensome. There will be always enow unavoidable necessities: And, therefore, he who wilfully createth more, is an unjust Usurper up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the substance of the Rich, and an unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table diminisher of the Alms of the Poor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:63399:10"/>
Now, towards the making of our fortune, religious Prudence prescribeth such means as these:</p>
            <p>To begin with God, praying for direction and success to that Governour of the World, to whom, after all our planting and watering, we owe the increase. To furnish our selves with competent skill in the affairs we undertake. To be diligent in them without anxiety, which interrupteth the steddy thoughts of Prudence, and hangeth weights upon business. To use the conversation of a few familiar Friends; and of such as may not rob us of our time, our substance, our innocence. To Account accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, and often. Not to esteem it a point of dishonour to examine the reckonings of impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and unreasonable men. Not to think it unworthy of us to bargain sometimes (as do the Politest of people, the <hi>Italians)</hi> for our Food and our Raiment. To cut off all vain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary, and much more all dissolute, expence. Not to engage in equal charge with persons of superior condition and fortune. Not to go to the utmost criticism in Modes. Not to be <hi>Trimalchio</hi>'s and artists in Luxury. Not to pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Beasts, and starve Christians. To do as much with our own hands as decency, ability,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63399:11"/>
and innocent diversion, will allow us. To have, as much as may be, upon our own mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, our <hi>own Eye,</hi> which is that auspicious star that ripeneth business by its influence, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it thrive and prosper. Finally, The way to advance our selves in all our Dealings, is, in all of them, to be just and honest. And this was the rule even of that late Philosopher <note n="l" place="margin">Ren. des Cartes in Epist. par. 1. p. 97.—Sit<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

                     <ex>que</ex>

            <p>But I enlarge my self (I believe) too too co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piously upon this subject, whilst I speak to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who understand the world with such judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous insight. So that, by the pursuit of such an Argument, I may seem, as it were, to utter Proverbs before <hi>Solomon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being now, by such means as have been mention'd, and by the blessing of God upon them, made competently able; It is our wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to raise and maintain (as in the Church <note n="m" place="margin">V. Tertul. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pol. C. 39. p. 31. Etiam si quod Arcae ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, &amp;c.</note> a publick, so in our Closet) a <hi>private bank of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> by laying aside a convenient share of our worldly Incomes for so worthy a purpose. It will grow insensibly: the Oyl will rise in sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing manner in the Cruise. And this being done, we shall then not be to seek for Alms up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sudden and emergent occasions; we shall
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63399:11"/>
have a store for daily needs; we shall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to alienate or to imbezzle that which we have devoted to so laudable, so sacred an use; we shall always give with chearfulness, having by us a stock designed to no other end than that of Charity: So necessary towards the furniture of a Religious Closet, where a mans circumstances can allow it, is a <hi>private Corban.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Discretion having, thus, in some measure either made or continued Provision for Alms; there is great need</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(In the Second place)</hi> of its further Care in the distribution and wise application of it, that Charity may attain its blessed Ends.</p>
            <p>Now discretion, in distributing of Alms, hath due regard to <q>
                  <hi>The Scope, the Objects, the Place, the Season, the Quality, the measure and proportion of this material Charity; and to the manner of its conveyance.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Prudence hath due regard to the <hi>scope</hi> of Charity, a failure in which, is an error in the foundation. For that which is given with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respect to the Glory of God who gave us all, and to the relief of real needs in humane Societies, is expence indeed, but it is not Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. It is wealth Exposed, but not Bestow'd. And when we give for no worthier end than
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63399:12"/>
the serving our humour, Pride, and Vanity, it is not at all probable that we shall place our Alms upon the most deserving. For, The bold, the talkative, the clamorous, the frequenters of publick places, will then be judged the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Instruments to blazon our praise, and to flatter our hypocrisie. If our scope be the sake of God and the common good, that will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us in the due application of our Alms to a purpose so fit to be our aim.</p>
            <p>There is great boast made of Alms in the Romish Church. They sound the Trumpet of them perpetually in our Ears. But what is the End to which a great part of this charity tendeth? Frequently the motive which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades them is extreamly selfish, and the means they use are extravagantly indiscreet. The scope they too often vainly aim at, is <hi>The blessing of a presumed Saint</hi> who is ignorant of them; <hi>Security</hi> from the external force of <hi>evil Spirits</hi> by the charms and spells of Monkish Conjuration, (A sort of Ecclesiastical Magick which those very Spirits invent and incourage); Avoidance of those causeless <hi>Curses</hi> and <hi>Anathema's</hi> which are with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror denounced from their seven-hill'd counterfeit <hi>Sinai;</hi> preservation from, or deliverance out of, the imaginary flames of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> blown
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63399:12"/>
on purpose by Jesuitick breath for the melting of the treasures of credulous people; <hi>Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation,</hi> as scandalous as it is chargeable, and performed in such manner, that, according to the note of <hi>Cardinal Bessarion,</hi> the making of their <hi>new Saints,</hi> doth move some sceptical men to question the <hi>old ones.</hi> Nay, sometimes, the scope is that very wicked one of compounding with heaven, by their liberal Alms, for their unforsaken sins: and here in this Nation (whilst <note n="n" place="margin">Horae B. M. v. ad Us.

            <p>The Event is, The alienation of Alms from their proper uses, the increase of Superstition, and the maintaining of an universal Usurper. For the Pence of S. <hi>Peter</hi> conduced to the buying of such a yoke as neither we nor our Fathers were able to bear.</p>
            <p>The things they purchase as conducive to these ends, are the wares of dark imposture; namely such as these. <hi>Shrines, Images, Lamps, Incense, Holy-water, Agnus Dei's, Blessed Grains, Roses, Peebles, Rings, Beads, Reliques, Pardons, Masses, Dirige's and Soul-obits;</hi> the goodly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventory of Superstition.</p>

               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:63399:13"/>
Blessed God! what a miserable and irratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal waste is this? what great good might have been done by the wealth laid out upon such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable and such dangerous Toys, with the prophane Merchandizers in the Romish Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? how many real necessities might have been supplyed by the many hundreds of pounds year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offer'd at that one <hi>Shrine</hi> of the pretended <hi>Martyr of Canterbury?</hi> how many hungry persons might have been fed; how many good men, bound in misery and iron, might have been set at Liberty by such Popish indiscreet Alms, squan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred so fruitlesly, and levell'd at a Scope to which Christianity did never direct?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> discretion duly considereth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>objects</hi> of Christian Charity; that dogs may not devour the bread of Children.</p>
            <p>The Objects which I shall speak of, are, <hi>First,</hi> those more <hi>Publick ones</hi> of common So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties and charitable Foundations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> those more <hi>Private ones</hi> of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Families and Persons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> touching those more Publick Objects, Societies founded by Charity; I shall, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, make only these sew Reflexions upon them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I observe (which is obvious enough)
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63399:13"/>
that it is an imprudent and irreligious libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which erecteth such Publick Houses and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, as please private Imagination, but disserve the Publick Interest. True Charity erecteth not such <hi>Sanctuaries</hi> as are too common in Romish Countries; such as are Refuges for wilful and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital malefactors. It foundeth not such <hi>Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> as are nurseries of a blind and formal way of worship: A kind of worship so very ritual, that the intention of the mind (unless it be of his who Officiates) is the least part of it. It favoureth not such <hi>Convents</hi> as receive, for term of life, the young, the strong, the able and apt for business, even against the desires, endeavours, importunities of their Parents, under pretence of teaching them to serve God with greater perfection. The Romanists frequently object to us that <hi>Statute</hi> which was made, in the <hi>Queens</hi> time, in favour of the poor: and they reproach us in a Proverb, saying, that <hi>begging began with Protestancy.</hi> But they should do well to use less partiality in their Censures, and to consider this plain truth, that the indiscretion of the <hi>Monasticks</hi> (by feeding the slothful, the superstitious, the Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astick, the Fryars Mendicants, the Pilgrims or loytering wanderers of that Church) provided objects of burthen and expence, for those of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63399:14"/>
the Reformation. And who (I beseech you) were most in fault, those who <hi>bred</hi> the Beggars; or those, who, finding them in great necessities, made a Law to keep them that they might not perish?</p>
            <p>Lastly (not to spare our selves where there is a failure) true Charity do's not countenance such <hi>places of exemption,</hi> as, by their private pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge, do not support the Government by sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the necessary Officers of State and Justice, in honour and without disturbance: such places into which the Law ha's reason to enter, yet (which is matter of just astonishment) no legal Authority.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I observe, that it is much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the publick Charities of the <hi>Reformed</hi> should serve the publick Interest, than those of the <hi>Roman</hi> faction. Among the truly Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, such Societies are founded upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse of plain, and prudent, and rational Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. To wit, that God may have a publick, reasonable service offered to him. That Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may be educated for offices Ecclesiastical, Civil, Military Mechanick. That offenders may be corrected, or secured. That the idle may be employed. That the aged, the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, the wounded, the sick, the distracted;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63399:14"/>
may have relief, shelter, cure and oversight.</p>
            <p>But in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the first motive to many Foundations is some pretended Vision or Revelation from God or a Saint. And by this means it comes to pass that sometimes fraud is a founder, and hysterick vapour (passing for O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle) a Benefactor. And in such Places Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asm is dutifully nursed and fed by those Societies, which owe to it their birth and original. The oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of them is fancifull, and the scope of them is an indiscreet (not to say an Idolatrous) end. Thus it came to pass in the several Houses of their celebrated S. <hi>Teresa</hi> the <hi>Foundress of the Reformation of the discalced Carmelites.</hi> I will give you her own words <note n="o" place="margin">Life of S. Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resa. 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> part, p. 2, 3.</note> with respect to her first Foundation of the Monastery of <hi>Avila.</hi> 
               <q>One day (saith <hi>Teresa)</hi> after I had commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, our Lord strictly charg'd me to set about this Foundation with all my might, making me great promises, that the Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry should not fail to be erected; that his divine Majesty should be very much served in it: that it should bear the title of S. <hi>Joseph,</hi> who should stand at one Gate for our guard, and our Lady, the glorious Virgin his Mother, at the other; and that himself would stand al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in our Company.—That I should tell my
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63399:15"/>
Confessor this, which his Majesty had enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me; and that he willed him not to oppose or hinder me at all.</q>
            </p>
            <p>You see what Hay and Stubble is at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of such buildings: and therefore, ifthe su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstructure be solid, and it be advanced and perfected by that great moral Architect, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, it is a miracle scarce inferiour to any which their <hi>Legends</hi> have fitted to the wide swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of their people. But if Discretion does not succeed <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> and correct it, what aids can be given, by so irregular and extravagant a principle, to the common good?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It may at least be <hi>offered</hi> to consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, whether Prudence would not judge it conducive to the publick interest, both of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Civil order, if there were <hi>places of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement,</hi> rightly constituted (without Masses, Images, Litanies to Saints, Cords of discipline, or any other instruments of Superstition) for the use of men of <hi>less sound temper,</hi> though their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease be not perfect distraction. These (one would imagine) might be fit retreats for the pensive, the melancholy, the male-content, the inordinately scrupulous, the fearful, the reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, the musing, the indiscreetly zealous, the fierce disputers of this world; the vain janglers,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63399:15"/>
who disturb peace and entangle truth: in summ, for the many who are not qualify'd for dispatch of business, or for freedom of conversation. By this means, pensiveness might be chang'd into godly sorrow; and discontent at the world, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to self-denial; and that Religious fury which now rageth in the very streets, into private De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion.</p>
            <p>But I say this with submission, and not with assurance: As also that there is a publick Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in nature and dignity before this; a due support of Gods publick service in all places of this Kingdom by such a maintenance as is not scandalous and insufficient. And thus far, ever since there was a prize put into publick hands at the dissolution of superstitious Houses, there has been part of a debt due from the <hi>State</hi> unto the <hi>Church;</hi> which God grant it may have abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and opportunity, and religious inclination to discharge.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> I cannot but take notice, upon this so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn memoria lof your publick Charities, of that singular Prudence which do's appear both in the founding, and in the managing, of the <hi>Hospitals</hi> of this illustrious <hi>City.</hi> The good ends to which they were so wisely design'd, and the diligent, prudent, and successful pursuance of those ends,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63399:16"/>
ought not to be passed by with supine and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful inadvertence.</p>
            <p>In this past year, there have been put forth <hi>Apprentices,</hi> and discharged out of <hi>Christs Hospital, Seventy six</hi> Children. There remain, under the care of it, <hi>five hundred fourty seven.</hi> And the number taken in, since the erection of it, has been about <hi>Twelve Thousand,</hi> of which many have proved eminent in divers faculties, and in Offices Sacred and Civil, and arriv'd at great things from very low beginnings. Ten of the formention'd Children have been, this year, placed out to Masters of Ships, having first been educated in the Arts of <hi>Aritbmetick</hi> and <hi>Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> by the Royal bounty of his most <hi>Excellent Majesty,</hi> whose great and wise example ought highly to be honoured, and diligently to be pursu'd by the people of this Island, which God and Nature have design'd, by its situation, for Sea-affairs; I had almost said, for the soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Ocean.</p>
            <p>There have been Cured, this last year, in the <hi>Hospital</hi> of St <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> nigh <hi>Sixteen Hundred</hi> persons, of which many were partakers, also, of other relief convenient for them.</p>
            <p>The like Charity has been extended to more than <hi>Eighteen hundred</hi> in the <hi>Hospital</hi> of St <hi>Thomas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:63399:16"/>
There have been received into the <hi>Hospital</hi> of <hi>Bridewell</hi> nigh <hi>Nine Hundred</hi> persons fit to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciplin'd into good manners. And it hath brought up, in divers Arts and Trades, no less than <hi>One Hundred twenty eight.</hi> And all this has been done, notwithstanding these <hi>Foundations</hi> have, so deeply, suffer'd by the dreadful calamity of <hi>Fire;</hi> the remainder of whose rage God, in mercy, restrain; that this great <hi>City</hi> may never mourn a second time sitting in Ashes; unless it be in those of Humiliation.</p>
            <p>I ought not, here, to forget the <hi>Hospital</hi> of <hi>Bethlem,</hi> that sanctuary of unsound minds, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling unhappily in unsound bodies. It hath, this year, received <hi>fifty three</hi> persons distempered in their imaginations. It hath Cured of Lunacy, and discharged <hi>Forty one;</hi> and it maintaineth under Cure a <hi>Hundred and ten;</hi> notwithstanding that great burthen of debt there is upon it, by reason of that noble and commodious structure lately erected.</p>
            <p>Happy the miserable who partake of this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; more happy they, who out of hearty love to God and Man, have raised the several funds of it: as also they who, with pious liberality, build further upon them.</p>
            <p>But I forbear to discourse more at large, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63399:17"/>
such publick Charities, in this place, where it appeareth, by the fruits of the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they are so well understood, and so prudently governed.</p>
            <p>I pass to the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second sort of charitable objects,</hi> those more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ones of miserable Families, or Persons. And here, discretion considereth that these words of the Lord Jesus <note n="p" place="margin">S. Matt. 5. 42.</note> 
               <hi>[give to him that asketh]</hi> are, by the Laws of reason, and by other pious Rules in Holy Scripture, to be, thus, expounded. <q>Be charitable to every one, even to those who have done thee injury, if thou judgest, in <hi>general,</hi> that they are fit objects; and, in <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial,</hi> that they are proper objects of <hi>thy</hi> Alms.</q> No man is, by the most luxuriant growth of Riches, made al-sufficient. The needs of a small Precinct in the world will soon exhaust e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Rich Man of <hi>Crassus,</hi> who would not reckon any one in that number, who was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to maintain an Army. Seeing, then, we cannot benefit all the world by our Alms, (though we may do it by our charitable Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for them;) it is fit that the little portion, which we are masters of, be placed upon those, whose circumstances are best suited to our own. Objects so particularly fit, are those in our
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63399:17"/>
Church, our Family, our Neighbourhood; in the places of our Birth, our Baptism, our Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, our Office, our Revenue, our spiritual assistance, our temporal deliverance or advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Amongst these objects fitted to our personal circumstance, discretion encourageth those one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who are likewise fitted for our Charity by their own just qualifications.</p>
            <p>Prudence, therefore, discountenanceth those who are <hi>irreligious and prophane,</hi> and never use the Name of Christ with shew of reverence, but when they ask an Alms with it: who will not follow Christ unless there be Loaves to tempt them. It discourageth those who have been <hi>early Beggars,</hi> and have sacrificed the very flower and strength of their Age to idleness: Who, being accustomed to sloth, are more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to shameful Poverty than honest la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Who tell us, falsly and absurdly, that it is as good to be idle for nothing, as to work for nothing. As if there were not <hi>profit in all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:</hi> As if sloth did not disable both mind and body: As if the mere employing of our time with diligence, did not secure us from many temptations. And certainly none have fallen into more, and into more perilous snares, than
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63399:18"/>
they who, from the beginning, have trodden the ways of unmanly laziness and unjust begging.</p>
            <p>Again, Prudence giveth no countenance to the <hi>over confident,</hi> who stand in need of such discipline as may humble them into a deeper and more becoming sense of their miserable and low condition; whose impudence, adding me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces to their intreaties, giveth us cause to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect concerning them, that they would extort those Alms by force (were it in their power) which now they endeavour to wrest by their boldness from timerous men, and from the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie-natured by their importunity.</p>
            <p>Likewise, discretion repulseth the <hi>craving and unsatisfy'd,</hi> who must have benefits cover'd dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with benefits, or else a shower of their impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations will find passage through them. These would monopolize Charity, as if <hi>they</hi> were the only objects on Earth; as if the comfortable dew of it were not well directed, if a drop of it fell besides their private fleece.</p>
            <p>It discourageth, also, the <hi>dissolute and riotous</hi> 
               <note n="q" place="margin">Tertul. Apol. c. 39. p. 31. <hi>Haecquasi deposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta pietatis sunt; nam indè non epulis, nec po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taculis, nec in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratis voratrinis dispensatur; sed egenis alendis humandisque, &amp; pueris ac puellis re ac parentibus destitutis, jam<expan>

               </note>, who turn the Alms of the day, into the revels of the night: who are not easie 'till by expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive intemperance they have unburthen'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63399:18"/>
of the little stock they have gathered. Amongst these, it setteth its face even against that sort of men who are for a season, very la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious. They will, for a while, endure the heat of the day with honest and painful diligence. They will be frugal and sober 'till a summ is earned: and then it is not laid up for the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of their Family, and against they themselves fail through impotence and Age; but the wages of some weeks are all riotously wasted in a few hours; and they use them as their thorns which, after a growth of some considerable time, make a blaze and crackling for a few moments.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, both Religious and Civil pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence refuseth to favour <hi>wanderours,</hi> who are, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes, pernicious spies and conveighers of unlawful Intelligence; who, in all places where they have opportunity, leave behind them the marks of their wickedness and dishonesty; who dare not lead their unwarrantable lives in any fixed abode, where the Government may take a true account of their behaviour under it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally,</hi> Discretion weigheth well the case of <hi>pretended Converts,</hi> lest, after the modern <hi>Policy of France</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Pol. of the French</hi> Clergy to destroy the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 151, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 204, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>, it setteth up a Market for <hi>Conversions,</hi> and exposeth Religion to sale in a mercenary world, where divers will turn their Conscience
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63399:19"/>
to that point from whence prosperity bloweth. It is exceeding tender of all those, who, for Christs sake, quit their Countries, their stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, their false Religion. But, if it sees any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable spot in the Morals of such who go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this character, it fears, for the sake of the same Blessed Jesus (whose Religion is too Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine to cover base and carnal purposes) to give them encouragement. It must be a mighty love of God, and a deep sense of Christian Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which will force a man, for mere Conscience sake, to die, as it were, whilst he is alive; to forsake the beloved Land of his Nativity, his dear Relations, his profitable employs, and to <hi>follow Jesus whithersoever he goes,</hi> be it to <hi>Pilates</hi> Tribunal, or to <hi>Calvary.</hi> Wherefore, he who pretends to have forsaken <hi>all</hi> that he may adhere to the Crucify'd Jesus, and leads not life very exemplary, and of remarkeable circumspection; awakens the jealousie of the Prudent, and gives them signs of his insincerity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Discretion hath regard to <hi>the place</hi> in which Charity is fitly dispensed. <hi>It giveth,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, very <hi>publickly,</hi> for Example sake, and sometimes very <hi>privately</hi> for Love sake, and as a sign to our selves of our freedom from vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory. <hi>It hath not a constant door</hi> for a promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuous,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63399:19"/>
bold, contentious crowd; but chuseth rather to conveigh its Alms to the houses of the needy, than to tempt them abroad daily, to the expence of their time, and modesty, and innocence; and the neglect of their Family and business.</p>
            <p>Again, Prudence raiseth not a <hi>great bank,</hi> by all the Alms it hath ability to give, for the behoof of some <hi>narrow Precinct,</hi> whose necessities re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire not such redundancy of supply. That will but bring burthen, instead of maintenance. For in this sence, also, our Lords saying is true, <hi>Where the Carcass is, there will the Eagles be gather'd together.</hi> Prudence (to use the words of a great man <note n="*" place="margin">Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> in his Advice touching Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi>'s Estate, in <hi>Resusc.</hi> p. 199.</note> from whom it is no shame to borrow) <hi>distributeth the remedy as the Disease is dispersed. Greatness of relief accumulate in one place, doth rather invite a swarm and surcharge of poor, than relieve those that are naturally bred in that place: Like to ill tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd Medicines, that draw more humour to the part, than they evacuate from it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> where Discretion findeth the needy actually in their miseries, or in their labour and industry, there it conceiveth it hath a <hi>fit place.</hi> offer'd to it for the depositing of its Alms.</p>
            <p>For the publick Streets and Avenues to Churches, the prudent are very sparing towards
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63399:20"/>
those confederate and immodest Petitioners, who perpetually haunt them. They fear to turn their Charity into a blaze of glory. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect little fruit from that which they scatter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the stones. They will not be imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or forc'd, by those bold people who are, on purpose, importunate in such publick places, where they think men will be sham'd, at least, into bounty towards them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Discretion considereth the <hi>time of giving Alms.</hi> It hath respect to the seasons of great Sickness, of great losses, of scarceness of Work, and of dearness of Provisions. It hath especial regard to diligent men just sinking in their fortune, who may, often, be kept above water by a very little help, when a hand is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunely reached towards them. It assisteth at the beginning of <hi>Arrests,</hi> where timely aid delivers men from perpetual chains. It giveth as <hi>soon</hi> as it seeth a fit object, not suffering the Christian to pine away whilst the Charity is growing. It placeth out to Masters the <hi>Children of the Poor,</hi> as soon as ever they are capable of work or instruction. By such means it prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth new Families of Beggars; it puts the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren into a capacity of being helpful to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; it secures their innocence, by preventing
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63399:20"/>
the very beginnings of begging which are dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous. For there seemeth to be a kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment in that evil Trade; and few who are enter'd are made to forsake it even by hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship it self.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Furthermore,</hi> As to time, prudence hath an especial eye upon the <hi>seasons of</hi> mens <hi>setting up</hi> in honest Callings; giving them some place of footing where they may stand. At such times, a small summ is a greater Charity, than the libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the openest hand, when the <hi>way</hi> of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is more fixed, and his circumstances are ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened into some degrees of prosperity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Likewise,</hi> Discreet charity is liberal at those <hi>solemn times</hi> when the Church celebrateth the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials of the <hi>Birth,</hi> the <hi>Passion,</hi> the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> the <hi>Ascension</hi> of the Saviour of the world; and the <hi>descent</hi> of the Holy <hi>Spirit</hi> of God: or, when it observeth publick <hi>Fasts;</hi> or other daies of <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> besides those already remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred: that so our giving of Alms may be an <hi>act</hi> and a <hi>sign</hi> also, both of our humanity and our Devotion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> If there be <hi>absolute necessity,</hi> wisdom judgeth that time, a season for assistance, even of the personally unworthy. If it hath power, it will pull out of the ditch the perishing Goat
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63399:21"/>
or Swine. It knoweth that <hi>extremity</hi> will give violent counsel, and that men, in such circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, will force a way to their relief, if they cannot find one.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Last of all,</hi> Wisdom turneth not all Alms into Legacies; it doth not adjourn all its Charity to the <hi>last Will,</hi> which is, sometimes, never made but in a vain purpose, and, as often, not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Discretion considereth the <hi>quality of our Alms.</hi> And here, it is our prudence to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer those which serve towards a <hi>constant</hi> provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before those which are <hi>transient:</hi> those, I mean, which help a man in a pang of need, but put him not into a <hi>way of living;</hi> which just hold him up from perishing, for an hour, but do not take him out of the deep waters. Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, also, perswadeth always to give <hi>suitable sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies,</hi> and not mere counsel when bread is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And it perswadeth to give such suitable supplies (if it consisteth with our convenience) rather <hi>in kind,</hi> than in that which will purchase them; as Cloaths to the naked, and Food to the hungry, and Books to the uninstructed, and Physick to the sick. Money can answer all these needs, but it will not be always laid out upon them. And for some materials of Charity, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63399:21"/>
does purchase them from <hi>Work-houses</hi> for the poor; at the same time doubling the good, by encourageing diligence and administring supply.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Discretion considereth the <hi>due measure</hi> and proportion of Alms, that it be fitted to the <hi>needs</hi> of the <hi>receiver,</hi> and to the <hi>ability</hi> of the <hi>giver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Touching the needs of the receiver,</hi> it doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways limit it self to mere necessity; but, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons whose fortunes are, by loss and accident, in declension, it hath respect to decence; consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how great the fall is from Riches to Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And, in men always poor, but always in hard labour, and able only to refresh life with the continual sweat of their brows; it pitieth the heaviness of their yoke. It sometimes sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth their flavish estate by some addition to the wages of their drudgery; and alloweth them some <hi>Sabbath</hi> for the ease of humane nature.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Touching the ability of the giver,</hi> discretion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidereth what we justly possess, and what quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of it is required for the supporting of us in the condition of our birth, our place, our office, our family, and for the discharge of our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It doth not require of all the same pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. Some may afford a twentieth, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63399:22"/>
others a thirtieth part: and to others, whose Children and dependents are numerous, and whose fortunes are entangled, the hundredth part may be over measure. According as the heap is, so the wise man soweth. Religious Prudence does not pull down one Family for the support of another. But for raising of a <hi>new Family</hi> to worldly grandeur (especially where the heirs of it are not encouragers of our hope, either by the quickness of their parts, or the virtuousness of their tempers, or the goodness of their educations) the wisdom of charity does not press it with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness. This is a design of no great use, but of great uncertainty. The Family of <hi>Herod</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">Joseph. Ant. l. 18. c. 7. Et R. R. Usserii Annal. A. 4079.</note> was all extinct in a single century of years. And it is noted by the Author of the <hi>Baronage</hi> 
               <note n="b" place="margin">Sir <hi>W. Dugd.</hi> Pref. to Vol. 1. p. 7.</note> 
               <hi>of England,</hi> that, of the 270 Families of which he treats, there were not, when he wrote, above <hi>eight</hi> remaining. And yet, a great many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent men live all their daies in unbecoming parsimony, and without doing good so much as to their selves, for the advancing of some mean man, born to labour and low estate, and uncapable of any thing greater than that which he is already. And such a one is ruin'd by his preferment. <hi>Galba</hi> said the honest truth of himself, when he told his Friends, That <hi>they
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63399:22"/>
had spoil'd a good Souldier, and made the worst of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Discretion hath regard to the due <hi>manner</hi> of dispensing Charity; obliging both by <hi>what</hi> it gives, and by <hi>the way of giving.</hi> It giveth <hi>not grudgingly, or of necessity,</hi> but with signs of a free and willing heart. It findeth out, privately, just needs, and it preventeth asking, and sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizeth with a kindness, for which the needy did not look. And this strengthens their faith in the providence of God who createth friends to them out of the dust; who bringeth them sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply without and beyond their expectation. Wherefore when prudence giveth, it doth it without malicious upbraiding or proud insulting. When a miserable creature <hi>would borrow</hi> [or, beg] <hi>of him, it turneth not him away</hi> 
               <note n="c" place="margin">S. Matt. 5. 42. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>. That is, it does not remove him to a distance, with signs of disdain, and contemptuous violence. It op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presseth not the modesty of the humble; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of those who have been wont to give and not to receive. To the more confident it giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with a mixture of governance and favour, that they neither be encouraged in insolence, nor driven to desperation.</p>
            <p>Having said all this touching the <hi>necessity,</hi> and the <hi>nature,</hi> of <hi>discretion in giving Alms,</hi> (and all,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63399:23"/>
with reference to the further judgment and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of a prudent man, when a particular case does lie before him;) It remaineth,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the last place,</hi> That I exhort both <hi>to Charity it self, and to the prudent exercise of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> I beseech you, be ye <hi>willing to give, and glad to distribute.</hi> Consider that power to do good, is a dangerous ability, unless we use it. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that it is God who giveth wealth, and that he expecteth some answerable returns of it. Live not in such inhumane manner, as if <hi>Nabal</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> were come again into the world. Think frequently and warmly of the love of God and Jesus to you. You will not deny your crumbs to the miserable, when you thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully call to mind that Christ gave, for you, his very flesh and his blood. Consider that, as one great end of Poverty is Patience, so one great end of Wealth is Charity. Think how honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able it is to make a <hi>present</hi> to the great King of the world; And what a condescension it is in his Alsufficiency to do that good by us, which he could, so abundantly, do without us. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not that <hi>you your selves are in the body;</hi> and that you know not what calamities may fall down upon the Earth, and what relief from others you may stand in need of. And let this be one
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63399:23"/>
of your daily thoughts, that, according to your Charity, the sentence of doomsday will pass upon you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> When you give Alms, do not offer the sacrifice of the indiscreet, which, it self, needeth atonement. Be not uncharitable by your charity. Add not to other evils, the <hi>great grievance</hi> of a numerous unmannag'd Poor. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, as far as in you lies, the reproach of a late sharp Writer <note n="d" place="margin">
                  <hi>J. M.</hi> Char. p. 10.</note>, who says, in effect, of the people of <hi>England,</hi> that they generally use a kind of <hi>mother-wit;</hi> and have the generosity to do <hi>great things,</hi> but not the discretion to do them <hi>wisely.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, that our Charity may be discreet, let us,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Exercise our minds with good <hi>compass of thought.</hi> He that regardeth only a few things, shall never arrive at Prudence. It is necessary for a man to consider his own condition, to view objects of Charity with a strict and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Eye, and to look round about them in all the circumstances which attend them. The imprudent behold a shew of misery, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no further; and, by one motive, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal of those Alms, from the misapplying of which many other Arguments would have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63399:24"/>
them. <hi>Plotinus</hi> 
               <note n="e" place="margin">Plotin. Enn. 1. l. 2. p. 11.</note> denieth <hi>that there is pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God,</hi> meaning it of that wisdom which needeth consultation <note n="f" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c.</note>. But it is not with man as it is with God, whose <hi>will</hi> is his <hi>wisdom.</hi> Man knoweth but few things, and cannot arrive at discretion without study. And it is worth his labour to study the art of knowing men, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry and observation; that he may secure his Charity from the wiles of the fraudulent: and not be abused by fictitious needs, and deceive himself into a dangerous conceit that <hi>he lends to the Lord,</hi> when he gives to those who, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, <hi>put out their very Alms to Interest.</hi> And, by degrees, a man will observe a <hi>certain Air</hi> in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly <hi>mendicants,</hi> which (as great Masters as they are in the art) they cannot easily dissemble. It is, indeed, possible for the wisest and most cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious observer to be, sometimes, mistaken. But then he hath this satisfaction in his mind, that he was not accessary to the imposture: and it is certain that they who are the blindest, are the soonest misled.</p>
            <p>But blind we shall be, and daily misled, unless, in</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The second place,</hi> We avoid slothful and easie <hi>credulity. Covetousness</hi> will require, as an excuse, and as a way of saving its beloved Money, very
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63399:24"/>
rigid demonstration, e're it giveth. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, <hi>credulity</hi> will be satisfy'd without to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable proof, and take a lewd man's <hi>asseverati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> for an <hi>argument.</hi> It behaveth it self towards the tales of Beggars, as it doth towards those of idle Pamphlets: Though it be, one day, gross<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceived by them, it will trust them the next that follows. And where there is such blind trust, the idle will multiply petitions and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. They will tell them they have <hi>suffered</hi> deeply by <hi>suretyship,</hi> though they never had the credit to get into Bonds. They will profess that they have <hi>suffered</hi> extremely <hi>by fire,</hi> though they be of that number of barbarous Thieves, who will set their Neighbours house on a flame, that they may the more securely share in his goods. The credulous will be deceived by those very appearances which would undeceive them, if they would use any competent refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and had not a kindness for the scales on their Eyes. I mean <hi>the naked arms and breasts of Mendicants</hi> in sharp seasons; and their lying in the Mire, and on the Pavements, day after day. Now, what a strength of nature is this which is not injur'd by those customary seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hardships, which would destroy the lives of many who are in sound and perfect health;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63399:25"/>
and who were not bred to tenderness but la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> For the administring of Charity with Prudence, it is necessary that even <hi>piety of inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> be directed by it. It is storied of Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> the Author of the <hi>English Martyrology,</hi> that he could deny no man who asked of him an Alms <hi>in the name of Jesus.</hi> His Piety is to be highly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued; but, surely, the weakness of it is not to be drawn into imitation. For multitudes use <hi>that name,</hi> to whom if we are liberal we offend our Saviour, who will say to them at the final judgment, <hi>Depart from me, I know you not [or will not own you as my Disciples] ye workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly, Superstition</hi> is to be removed, that Charity may have its perfect work. <hi>In the Eastern Countries,</hi> it seedeth Dogs, and other such Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, with provisions much more convenient for men; conceiting that it is, thereby, charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the souls of some of their departed Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, which are wander'd into the bodies of those beasts. In those, and in <hi>divers other parts of the world,</hi> it erecteth Convents for <hi>Will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;</hi> and fixeth <hi>Romish Emissaries</hi> in such <hi>posts,</hi> that they may give disturbance to reformed Christendom. In summ, it can do nothing di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>screetly,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63399:25"/>
being the issue of reverence overstrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and of devout imagination heated into mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That Charity may be prudent, let us avoid all <hi>pride</hi> of heart which dealeth out the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of it to the unqualifyed and unworthy. It would buy off the clamour of <hi>their</hi> tongues whose credit is so low that it can give no authority to their slanders. It fears the <hi>calumny</hi> of <hi>penuriousness,</hi> which will not <hi>stick</hi> long upon any man, who is not sparing in any other case, where he may be <hi>justly liberal,</hi> and not prostitute his Riches. It would bribe the mercenary throats of vile people, into the flattering sounds of, <hi>good Man, brave House-keeper,</hi> and <hi>bountiful Master. Wretched ambition,</hi> which loveth the praise of licentious Mendicants, more than the suffrage of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and the praise of God!</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Let us arm our selves with <hi>Christian courage,</hi> that the menaces, and revengeful looks of the sturdy and desperate, may not affright us into a misplacing of our Alms. God will protect us in well-doing against all their cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less threats and imprecations. And whether is it better, to fear the loose tongue of an ungodly man, or a dreadful thunderbolt from the just hand of Heaven?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:63399:26"/>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Let us conquer <hi>foolish pity</hi> and irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional compassion. That affection is put into men by nature, to keep their reason from lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing, and not to pervert it. Yet it is daily suffered to do this disservice in cases of Charity. There is doleful clamour in the <hi>ear,</hi> and a shew of extream misery before the <hi>eye;</hi> and this raises, by mere <hi>mechanick force, a pang</hi> in the heart. And nothing maketh the impression, but an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of sadness in the object. The image of it is dreadful; but men under the dominion of passion, consider not whether it be a real mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or a fiction, and a kind of spectre of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty. They examine not whether all this, if real, is not the effect of vice and sloth; and whether industry could not supply those needs for which ther Alms are ask'd, in a <hi>careful tone,</hi> formed, on purpose, to move compassion. But to ease this present <hi>pang</hi> in their <hi>bowels,</hi> they give at adventure, and thereby put a thorn into their <hi>Conscience.</hi> Some of the <hi>Primitive Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">V. Lucian. de Morte Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grin.</note>, out of the abundance of their compassion, gave Alms unwarily to many crafty <hi>Heathens,</hi> who knew their weakness, and serv'd themselves upon it. And by this means, those less prudent Christians increased the Riches and the power of the Enemies of their persons and their Holy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:63399:26"/>
There are many who have either none of the miseries which they feign, or none which they would part with. In some, loud sighs, and deep groans, and flowing tears, and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionate complaints, are all counterfeit and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial. And if they move <hi>your hearts,</hi> they have more influence upon them, than they have upon <hi>their own.</hi> It is said of two Beggars <note n="h" place="margin">Soz. Eccl. Hift. l. 7. c. 27.</note> who had a design upon the Charity of <hi>Epiphanius Bishop of Salamine;</hi> that, to move his pity, one feign'd himself dead, and the other stood weeping and mourning over him. There are many who are reconciled to very ill circumstances, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to beg with. They would not part with their Ulcers, their scarrs, their Crutches, left they part with their idleness and their Alms. By such ways they extort that from the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of mens hearts, which the firmness of their reason would have preserved from abuse. But, alass! This Charity which springeth from such soft temper as cannot bear up against any thing that looks like Tragedy, does not deserve the name of that Grace; nor shall it have its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. For it gives indiscreetly <hi>for its own ease,</hi> and not to please God in the relief of just ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities. If this foolish compassion may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Charity, the weeping at disasters of persons
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63399:27"/>
in Romance, may challenge the name of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian pity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>These means,</hi> then, let us diligently use, that the wisdom of our minds may guide the libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of our hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So</hi> shall we justifie our selves to our own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; <hi>so</hi> shall we best promote the common good; so shall we imitate the great and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise God, who <hi>is good and does good,</hi> and does all things <hi>in number and weight and measure.</hi> So shall we <hi>provide for our selves, bags which wax not old, and lay up for our selves an enduring treasure in the Heavens,</hi> and <hi>find mercy in that day</hi> when we shall stand in the greatest need of it. Having in our life time shewn discreet compassion to the <hi>Lazar</hi>'s who are fit objects of it, we shall, when we die, be received into the bosom of the most blessed <hi>Jesus, to whom, with the Father and the Holy Ghost, be given all Honour for ever.</hi> Amen.</p>
