            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

is not a peculiar and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct

there will fall out to be

very high and necessary

            <p>First this:</p>

            <p>That by the grace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version,
there is a divine
quality stamped and imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
upon the naturall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
which is, <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly this:</p>
            <p>That Conscience thus qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
with goodnesse is a
<hi>Feast.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly this:</p>
            <p>That this feast of a good
Conscience is not onely for
a time, but for eternity, not
only a long, but a <hi>continuall</hi>
feast.</p>
            <p>These ought to be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled

that hath been said, talked,

right; as, What is the rule

which question, Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

               <p>The second question is
<hi>de facto,</hi> touching the fact,
thus, The law indeed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares,
but how hast thou
complyed in practice with
this Law, by doing accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to it? Unto which

thus, what reward now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines,

               <p>The last way to find out
the nature of Conscience
is by defining it to a practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

in which are all the

true Religion and the feare
of God, is the chiefest bridle
to hold us in from villanie

is most true: for if we did

our selves, how could we
by lust, covetousnesse, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance,

so degrade man in our

that lawyer, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,

this selfe-reverence,

This law or line of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is foure-fold.</p>
               <p>1. <hi>Divine</hi> law,<note place="margin">1. Jus Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinum.</note> which is
the will of God revealed
in Scripture, is the proper
and adequate rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science;
it hath of it self an
adnate priviledge to bind
conscience, and wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it holds out to man
a light to shew him his
duty, it doth withall tie
such a bond of obedience
upon the conscience, as
no creature is able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease.</p>
               <p>2. The law of <hi>Nature</hi> is
also a good rule of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:<note place="margin">2. Jus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

for that naturall light
and engraffed instinct writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in our hearts, shews us


<pb n="41" facs="tcp:103990:26"/>
also what is to be done,
and what to be avoided.
That there is a God; that
this God is to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
that we ought to live
honestly, hurt no body,
give every one his owne,
doe as we would be done
to; these and such like are
the dictates and statutes of
the law of nature, and doe
bind conscience.</p>
               <p>3. The law of <hi>Nations</hi>
also,<note place="margin">3. Jus Gentium.</note> which is brought in
by the common consent of
all people: for that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
false or wrong which
all the whole world cals
truth and right. Humane
nature was yet never so
much at a losse, as that a


<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103990:27"/>
right opinion of what is
just, &amp; equall should quite
perish from the earth. The
division of things, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation
of them to
their owner, the faire usage
of Embassadours, &amp;c. are
draughts of the law of all
nations, and doe likewise
binde conscience.</p>
               <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">4. Jus po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitivum.</note> 
                  <hi>Positive</hi> lawes,
whether they be Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall,
or Civill, doe lye
strong bands and tyes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Conscience, as well as
either the lawes of God,
or of nature, or of nations.
A thing is said to be of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
law, when it is thus,
or so, not of any intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
necessity, arising out of


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103990:27"/>
the particular essence of
the thing, but may either
be, or not be, and when it
is, may either continue or
cease, by humane imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And even such lawes
as these, while they are
not contrary, but subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
unto, and commensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
with the divine law,
have an obligatory power
over Conscience; not that
any law of man hath of
and from it self any <hi>connate</hi>
power to over-awe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
nor can the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
subject her selfe to
the jurisdiction of any
creature, without Idolatry,
but it hath an <hi>adnate</hi> power
rather, to wit, as it receives


<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103990:28"/>
influence, and vertue from
Gods law, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
us to obey every
lawfull ordinance of man
for Conscience sake.</p>

                     </gap>entiae.</note>
the second respect must be
to the <hi>force</hi> of Conscience:
for though Conscience be
never so well principled
and illuminated, yet if it be
dull and slegmatick, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
vigor and force to put
things in execution, it is
but as a fire of straw which
hath light without heat, or
as a wel-shap'd horse with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
mettall.</p>
               <p>Now the force of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
consists in <hi>Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>


                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:103990:28"/>
both in tying a man
<hi>from</hi> that which Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
judgeth sinfull, and
tying him <hi>to</hi> that which
Conscience judgeth right.
In which respect, take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
what high language
the Scripture adapteth to
expresse this thing; as cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
a man in relation to
this work of Conscience, a
<hi>debtor, Rom.</hi> 1. 14. a <hi>servant,
Rom. 6. 16. bound, Acts 20.

                     </gap>, Acts</hi> 4. 20.</p>
               <p>Such is the strength and
vertue of Conscience, that
an action by its owne na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
indifferent, it can make


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103990:29"/>
bad or good, and an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in it selfe good, it can
corrupt and make naught.
Only an action which is ill
and naught in it self, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
make good.</p>
               <p>Yea such is the validity
of Conscience that it binds
in some cases even when it
erres: for Conscience
judging that to be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
which is lawfull, bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
to abstaine from that
lawfull, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 14. and
Conscience judging that
to be debt and necessary,
which is only allowable
and arbitrary, bindeth to
doe that arbitrary thing,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 5.</p>
               <p>So as both these requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sites


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103990:29"/>
taken in together, and
a due proportionable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperation

the light and heat, the

of Conscience, do consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
a rectified conscience,
fit to goe about that work
and labour, for which God
created such a faculty, and
seated it in the soul of man.
A law without sufficient
force to execute it, is but a
dead letter, and lets a man
lye like the lame creeple at
the pooles side, seeing the
bath, but wanting strength
to step into it. And force
without law is but a riot,

I may not be judged of the

               <p>And having thus shewed
the method of rectifying
the erring conscience, let
us now also declare the
right order of pacifying
the troubled conscience.
Upon which point before
we fall directly, we must
needs put a difference (for
a difference there is) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>sicknesse of fancie,</hi>
when the thoughts are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted,
and drawne aside
from off pleasing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
objects, and doe
wholly fasten and sit
abrood on sad and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
things, and true formall
trouble of minde, which


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:103990:31"/>
alwaies gathers to an head,
either by reason of <hi>solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
to sin,</hi> or <hi>remorse for
sin:</hi> distemper of fancie is
commonly a wild and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
thing, and
swerves from that we call
judgement, or <hi>recta ratio;</hi>
Or if it fasten upon sinne,
which sometimes it doth,
its troubled either with

rationall and congruous

Method it selfe now fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
which consists in a
certaine Scale or Ladder:
The severall grades or


<pb n="54" facs="tcp:103990:33"/>
steps whereof are these.</p>
               <p>1. There can be no
sound peace of Conscience
till we be atoned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to God: for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
is as Gods setting-dog,
or as his Serjeant
which will not take off the
arrest till its Master be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed.</p>
               <p>2. Neither can there be
any agreement or atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with God, without
pardon of sin. God will not
be reconciled to any man
<hi>lite pendente,</hi> till the fault
which caused the variance
be forgiven.</p>
               <p>3. Nor can there be any
remission without satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
for if the Salvation


<pb n="55" facs="tcp:103990:33"/>
or damnation of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
lay'd thereupon,
God will not, cannot be
unjust to himselfe, to be
kind to us.</p>
               <p>4. No satisfaction neither
will serve the turne, but
such as is porportionable
to the sault: for tis the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Motto of Justice,<note n="*" place="margin">Noxae poena par esto.</note> 
                  <hi>Let
the punishment be equall to
the damage, the payment to
the debt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. No satisfaction can be
proportionable, which is
not infinite, because our
sins are committed against
a Majestie absolutely infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
and they also are as
neere infinite as number,
or hainousnesse can make


<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103990:34"/>
them: and if there could
be another infinite besides.
God, I would say it were
the sinnes of the world.</p>
               <p>6. No infinite satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
can be made but by a
person of infinite excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
and worth, whose per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall
dignitie must give
such a tincture of price,
and value to his sufferings,
as what he suffered in a
short time, was equivalent
to what all the world
should have suffered for
ever and ever.</p>
               <p>7. We never knew, nor
heard of; never did any
Historian tell, or Prophet
foretell of any such wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
person, but JESUS


<pb n="57" facs="tcp:103990:34"/>
CHRIST, who was God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man;
man to suffer, God to
overcome in suffering; man
to dye, God to rise againe.</p>
               <p>8. That price, though
most sufficient in it selfe,
yet not effectuall to us, if
not applyed and made our
owne. The best cordiall
comforts not, if not taken.
The most magisterial plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
heales not, if not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
to the fore.</p>
               <p>9. As that Application
is made on Gods part, by
<hi>imputation,</hi> so on our part
by <hi>faith.</hi> God must impute
the righteousness of <hi>Christ</hi>
unto us, and we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it from God, by the
hand of faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:103990:35"/>
10. And that faith is but
equivocall faith, and no
true, justifying, salvificall
faith, which doth not work
by love; love to God in
<hi>holinesse,</hi> love to man in
<hi>righteousnesse,</hi> and love to
our selves in <hi>sobrietie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are the severall
ingredients into this balme
of <hi>Gilead,</hi> according to the
dispensatory of Divinity.
These are the severall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of this Ladder,
whose foot, like <hi>Jacob's,</hi>
standeth upon earth, and
the top reacheth heaven.
Let us recollect them by
an analyticall methode,
and so conclude this point.
I. Practise charity, and


<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103990:35"/>
that's a signe of true faith.
2. Have faith, and you shall
be able to apply on your
part, what God imputes
on his. 3. Apply, and what
is sufficient in it selfe, shall
be effectuall to you. 4. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is sufficient but <hi>Jesus
Christ.</hi> 5. The reason of his
sufficiencie is from the
dignitie, and excellencie
of his person. 6. Nor yet
were his person of suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
dignity, if it were not
in him an infinite dignity.
7. And being infinite, the
ransome and satisfaction is
proportion to the fault.
8. And upon this satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
must needs follow
remission. 9. And having


<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103990:36"/>
remission, there followes
also reconciliation with
God. 10. And being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
with God, we
shall have tranquillity of
mind, and peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
passing all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.</p>

was, that though God
should condemne him, yet
he hoped therein of Gods

mitigated with
those that suffered least:
in all which troubles (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding)
no world of

is often without any fault
of ours, or at least may be
so, as no other cause may

               <p>For such is our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
that we could never
be brought to renounce
one love, unlesse we found
another more sweet; for
which cause we see often
that the comforts of yong

in Religion, are often
greater and more sensible,

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> And yet (fifthly) know it
is dangerous to dis-esteem
and contemn divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations:
for though for
the sustaining of those
that are religious, and of
scrupulous consciences it
be said truly that Grace
consists not in spirituall
consolations, but in vertue,
&amp; that they are rather part
of our reward then of our
duty: yet if there be any,
that through negligence &amp;

Sanctity and Godlinesse
consist not in them, yet are
both of them great encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
to a reformed

               <p>And therefore we are to

<hi>viz.</hi> when they are

               <p>Now what is to be done

The sick man must eate,

take heed of crying at the

(like the rich glutton in the

every day?</p>
               <p>Let us state the point.
The Theame to be spoken

               <p>A good Conscience is a
Pillow, if a man lye down;
a Cushion, if a man sit; a
Staffe, if a man walke; an

would shade himselfe. If a
man be sick, 'tis a Physici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;
if in suit, it is a Lawyer;
if wrongfully accused, it is
a true witnesse; if unjustly

thirsty, it is a refreshing ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
if hungry, it is a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull

no state or condition of life

but in it a man shall find the
joyes and delights of a

               <p>Consult the Oracle, and

               <p>Secondly, in outward

of <hi>Abimelech,</hi> Gen. 20. 5.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, in life, by the

2 Cor.</hi> 1. 12.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, in death, by the

2 Kings</hi> 20. 3.</p>

the Peace of Conscience
shall be taken away, all

               <p>It was a good Conscience

comfortable Visitation,
wherein hee doth more

               <p>1. At a Christians first
Conversion unto God, as

<hi>exchange</hi> joyes, such as
are dilute, and grosse, for
such as are sincere, and

               <p>2. After some good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
especially if it,
have come off well, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of <hi>matter, manner,</hi> and

part of the Performers
<hi>Merces,</hi> and Reward, and
withall an earnest and

3. Upon evill suffered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
no lesse then upon good

of Hess long a priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

him during his

he had felt <hi>the divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations
even of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs
themselves,</hi> all that

comforts, which they
were never partakers of
all their life besides, either
before or after.</p>
               <p>4. After the brunt of
some sore tentation is
over, Satan out-wrestled, a
spirituall conflict ended, a
desertion over-blowne,
then God also useth to

supple the nerves and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

are without any fee or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,

They are the farre
better to be liked for that.
They are the more hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
for you the Auditors,
because all danger of our

is hereby taken away. And
they are nor the lesse hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to us the Preachers:

for if we be faithfull in this

have a greater reward,
then any you can give us.</p>
               <p>And here I doe pause a

upon due deliberation, do
wish with all my heart,
both for my selfe, and all
my brethren of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie,
that the portion of

worke of the Ministery,
whether publique or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.</p>
               <p>Then should you see
sinners otherwise repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,

sick couches otherwise vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited,
then to give the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
such a peace as

               <p>But to divert no further,
I will in speaking unto you
labour to keepe an even
path, betwixt <hi>detraction</hi>
and <hi>flattery,</hi> and first brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but faithfully, reprove
what I think at this time
most reproveable; and
then as candidly commend
what is in you commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
that so those faults
amended, and these vertues
being retained, you may


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:103990:71"/>
partake of this feast of a
good Conscience.</p>
               <p>And for the first of these
twaine, I will search none
of your old sores at this
time, but onely note unto
you two faults which have
of late rendered this City
blame-worthy both to
God and man.</p>
               <p>The first is the great
schismes and dis-unions
which have lately burst
forth amongst you, one of
you being very <hi>Ishmaels</hi>
to another, whereas a City
should be <hi>at unitie in it
selfe,</hi> and is the very Proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type
and Copie of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
and Unitie. That
<hi>Vnitie is omnipotent</hi> is one


<pb n="130" facs="tcp:103990:72"/>
of <hi>Scaligers</hi> subtleties; to
be undevided and indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
is the chiefe and first
Excellencie of the blessed
Trinitie. Therefore the
<hi>Pythagoreans</hi> call the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of two an <hi>infamous</hi>
number, because it first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedeth
from Unitie. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more divine then
<hi>Vnitie,</hi> nothing more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
then <hi>division.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The second is your City-tumults,
tumults in the
City, and tumults from
the City, just like that
<hi>Ephesian</hi>-tumult, <hi>Acts 19.
Confused, and the more part
not knowing wherefore they
were come together.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
which I will only


<pb n="131" facs="tcp:103990:72"/>
aske you this one questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>What fruit have you
now of those things?</hi> Have
you thereby, trow ye, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God? No sure, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
highly offended him:
for God is the God of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
not of confusion. Have
you pleased the King? you
know how high his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
runne. Have you
pleased the Parliament?
they doe by no meanes
own your disorders. Have
you helped trade? I trow
not: and pity it were it
should be helped by these
wayes, lest prosperous fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
should be accounted
wisdome, and prosperous
wickednesse be accounted


<pb n="132" facs="tcp:103990:73"/>
vertue. Let me but aske
one question more, Have
you hereby got the feast of
a good Conscience? I
think there is a great deale
more cause, why in this
case, Conscience should be
a WORME then a FEAST.</p>
               <p>I have done my repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension,
and comming to
you with a rod. I will now
come to you with the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of meeknesse, and praise
you, where you are truly
praise-worthy, for your
Charity towards orphans,
the poore, the blind, the
lame, the self-lame slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
&amp;c. or rather praise
the Grace of God, who
hath made you both <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentes</hi>


                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:103990:73"/>
and <hi>volentes,</hi> able
and willing hereunto. And
here I wil limit your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to these three heads,
<hi>viz.</hi> 1. To shew you a
good Rule of Almes and
Charitie. 2. A good Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme
thereof. And lastly a
good Example.</p>
               <p>For the first, all the best
Rules of Almes are united
and concentred in that one
Text of the Preacher, <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.
11. 1. Cast thy bread
upon the waters: for thou
shalt finde it after many
dayes.</hi> Let us such the Text.</p>
               <p>1. In the first word CAST
lye closely three distinct
Eleemosynarie Rules, that
is, 1. We ought to give


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:103990:74"/>
Almes <hi>bountifully,</hi> and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally,
<hi>to sow plentifully.</hi>
2. <hi>Cheerfully</hi> also, and with
a ready al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> critie of minde.
3. <hi>Speedily</hi> and seasonably,
whilest now the necessity
presseth the receiver, and
summoneth the Almoner:
for without all these we
doe but <hi>drop,</hi> or <hi>sprinkle,</hi> or
<hi>lay down;</hi> we do not <hi>sow,</hi> or
<hi>cast</hi> our Almes.</p>
               <p>2. In the word THY two
other Rules are implyed:
1. That works of mercy
must be founded on justice.
2. They must also be foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
on industry and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
in our particular
callings: for OUR <hi>bread,</hi>
and MY bread, and THY


<pb n="135" facs="tcp:103990:74"/>
                  <hi>bread</hi> in Scripture-Phrase
are opposed to a two-fold
bread, which are the bread
of others, not our owne,
to wit, 1. <hi>The bread of deceit,</hi>
the cheat-loaves of fraud.
2. <hi>The bread of Idlenesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. In the word BREAD is
expressed the matter of
right Almes; we must give
unto the indigent not a
<hi>serpent,</hi> but <hi>fish;</hi> not a <hi>stone,</hi>
but <hi>bread;</hi> that is to say,
such things as will help
truly to support &amp; relieve
their poore and low con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition:
for by the word
<hi>Bread</hi> both in the Lords
Prayer, and other Texts of
Scripture, all things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
are to be understood.


<pb n="136" facs="tcp:103990:75"/>
Mercifull Christians must
both fill the bellies, and
clothe the backs, and cover
the heads of the hungry,
and naked, &amp; harbourless,
else they give but <hi>crummes</hi>
or <hi>crusts,</hi> not <hi>bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. In the words UPON
THE WATERS, there are
two notable Rules more:
for if <hi>Waters</hi> be referred
to the Giver or Almoner,
then this Rule will thence
arise, That we must afford
<hi>pitie</hi> as well as <hi>pietie,</hi> sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy
and condolencie of
affection as well as reliefe.
We must <hi>weepe with those
that weepe,</hi> as well as wipe
away teares from their
eyes. And if you meane


<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103990:75"/>
the <hi>waters</hi> of the receiver,
or poore man, then it sets
out the proper object of
Almes, namely he whose
head is a fountaine, and his
eyes conduits of teares to
bewaile his low, and mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
condition. And the
Rule is this, that <hi>Miserie
is the proper object of Mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5. In the last words, the
Promise of FINDING
<hi>againe,</hi> this Rule lyes hid,
That, <hi>Almes must be given
in faith.</hi> That God will
both accept them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
them, though not for
the works sake, yet for his
mercies sake, and for his
Christs sake. Therefore it
is notable, that our Saviour


<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103990:76"/>
in the Gospel having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted
to Almes, in the
very next words bids,
<hi>Get bags:</hi> The inference
seemes but weake, first to
poure out, and give away,
and then get bags; rather,
let a man scrape, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade,
and then get bags: but
the sense is, That the more
bountifull we are in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
&amp; charitable Almes,
the more abundant shall
Gods blessings be, both
spirituall, and temporall.
Therefore <hi>Whilgift</hi> Arch-bishop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> after
he had finished hi Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
at <hi>Croyden,</hi> said, he
could not perceive, That
therby he was in his estate


<pb n="139" facs="tcp:103990:76"/>
a peny the poorer. These are the
Rules of Almes-deeds.</p>
               <p>The Embleme of Almes I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
you is this: <hi>A naked Boy
with a cheerefull Countenance, fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with hony a Bee without wings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Play the <hi>Pierius</hi> upon this Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphick.
1. This Boy is <hi>naked,</hi>
because Charitie seeketh not her
own. 2. <hi>With a cheerefull Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi>
because God loves a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
giver. 3. <hi>Giving hony;</hi> hony, not
gall; bread, not stones. We must
give <hi>good things</hi> to those that aske.
4. <hi>To a Bee,</hi> not a droane; to a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer,
not a loyterer. 5. <hi>Without
wings,</hi> that is all one, as to the <hi>trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
hand,</hi> in MOSES his Law, to
such an one as God hath disabled
by sicknesse, lamenesse, great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbencies,
old age, or the like.


<pb n="140" facs="tcp:103990:77"/>
For 'tis a good distinction (I find, in
the Book of Martyrs, in a Sermon
of <hi>B. Ridly,</hi> before K. <hi>Edward</hi> 6.)
of poore of <hi>Gods making,</hi> and poor
of <hi>their own making,</hi> by Idlenesse,
thriftlesnesse, riot, &amp;c. for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a <hi>Bride-well,</hi> or house of corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is the best Almes: for the
former, <hi>Cast thy Bread upon the
waters, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now lastly, for Examples and
Presidents of Almes-deeds, we
see daily faire ones: How God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largeth,
and expanseth the hearts
of his Saints to shew their faith by
their workes. I referre you to a
Treatise written by D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Willet,</hi>
wherein he undertaketh by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
to shew how farre the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
deeds of Protestants, since
the Reformation of Religion,


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103990:77"/>
have both in number, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
even in these places, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
those of the Papists, in a
farre longer tract of time. It is a
thing worth the considering both
to silence their obloquie of us in
calling us <hi>Solifidians,</hi> and their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancie
of themselves as if they
onely were full of good works. It
is now divers yeeres since D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi>
wrote that, I wish some know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hand would perfect it, and
adde unto it, what hath been done
since, not to the pompe or pride
of any either persons, or places,
but to <hi>The honour of God,</hi> who
gives grace unto men.</p>
               <p>And here is a fit place to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate
