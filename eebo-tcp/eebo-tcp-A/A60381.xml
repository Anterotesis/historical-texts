            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the UNIVERSITY READER.</head>
            <p>THESE Papers neither have, nor need any other
recommendation, then that of the Cause which
they maintain. They are extorted by the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of those Adversaries, who have endeavour'd to
wound us in all our nearest concerns, The Honour of
our University, the Autority of our Church, and the
Rights of our Sovereign. The <hi>Laborious Author</hi> of the
<hi>Discourses</hi> spar'd no pains to shake the foundations of our
Religion; and the <hi>designing Publisher</hi> has with no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable
expence, endeavoured a farther advantage
from them, by casting a reproach npon these Seminaries
of our Education. But it is justly hop'd, that their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
against the University will prove as successless as
their attempts on the Church; Of which we know, that
<hi>tho' the Rains descend, the Flouds come, and the Winds
blow, yet it cannot fall, for it is founded upon a Rock.</hi>
The hopes of our Enemies abroad have been entertain'd,
and the solicitude of our Friends awaken'd by the news
of our Oxford Converts daily flocking into the bosom of
the Roman Church. But we hope All men are by this time
convinc'd that they deserve as little consideration for
their Number, as they do regard for their accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
No one need to be alarm'd at the Desertion of
Six or Seven Members, who shall consider their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
on <hi>One</hi> who by the Magazines, which He had
stor'd up against Us, shews that He has not now first
chang'd his Complexion, but only let fall the Vizour. Nor
ought we more to regard the Insinuations of those, who
tell us of the secret Promises of such as have not openly
Profest, as having no other ground but the confidence of
the Reporters. But be it as it will, <hi>God covers us with
his Feathers, and under his Wings will We trust; We
<pb facs="tcp:48656:3"/>
will neither be afraid of the arrow that flieth by day,
nor for the Pestilence that walketh in darkness:</hi> But we
least of all fear any danger from this praesent attempt
of our Author, since the Regal power seems engag'd
with our Church in one common defence; For she is no
farther concern'd in this present Controversie, then as
she is accus'd to have been too great a friend to the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
of the Crown. And certainly that Doctrine
which invades the just Rights of the Prince, can hope
but for few Proselytes amongst those, who have constant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
defended them in their <hi>Writings,</hi> asserted them in
their <hi>Decrees,</hi> and upon all occasions vindicated them
with their <hi>Swords.</hi> For We do not lie open to the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of a condition'd and distinguishing Loyalty, who
have shew'd our readiness to imitate the glorious exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
of our Fathers, and were prepar'd (had not God's
good Providence prevented our service) to have tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scrib'd
that Copy lately at <hi>Sedgmore,</hi> which they set us
formerly at <hi>Edge-hill.</hi> And in truth our steady fidelity
to the Prince is so unquestionable, that our Enemies
have been pleas'd to ridicule what they could uot deny,
and have made Passive Obedience bear a part in our
Character, when the Muse has been inclin'd to Satyr.</p>
            <p>As for our Author and his <hi>Theses</hi> there is nothing
here advanc'd which was not in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
answer'd by Protestant Writers; and had he written
in <hi>Henry the 8th's</hi> Reign, he might have receiv'd a Reply
from a Roman Catholic Convocation; So vain is it to urge
Us now with the stale pretences of a Forreign Iurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which our Ancestors of the Roman Communion eje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
with so Universal a consent, and which our Fathers
of the Reformation resisted even unto death; I mean
those Glorious Prelates, who here dying seal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d the truth
of our Religion with their Blood, and left it as a Legacy
to us their Children, by us to be convey'd to the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
yet to come.</p>

            <p>AS that Person, who would prove himself a genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
Son of the Church of England, had need of
more Sincerity then this Editor shew'd, whilst
He profest to be of Her Communion; so one, who has
the ambition of appearing a potent Enemy against her,
had need of greater Strength then he has either produc'd
of his own, or borrow'd from others, since he has been
her declar'd Adversary. Had he continued still to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble
his Faith, and affected an aequilibrium betwixt
both Churches, His writings would have been more sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to such a Character; where the attentive Reader
will find the Church of England but weakly attacq'd,
and that of Rome as faintly vindicated. But since some
Motives have prevail'd with him to assume the Name
of another Church, as that which he has left has no great
cause to lament the loss of such a Member, so that which
He would seem to have fled to will have little reason to
boast that She has gain'd a Proselyte. For how plausib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
soever He may discourse of Church-Autority, He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
in too great a <hi>Plerophory</hi> of his own sense, to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
himself either to a Convocation at home, or Council
abroad; and altho' he would appear an Enemy to <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
he seems at this very time to be drawing up a
novell Scheme of Doctrines, and modelling to himself a
new Church.</p>
            <p>Hence it is that in one of his Treatises he has deserted
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48656:4"/>
the antient Plea of Transubstantiation, upon which the
Tridentine Fathers founded their Adoration of the Host;
and from which all the great Champions of that Church
have constantly deduc'd it. Hence his modifying the
Council's <hi>Sacramentum</hi> into <hi>Res Sacramenti,</hi> his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scinding
from the Symbols, his certain inferior <hi>cult</hi> only
due to them, his stripping them even of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
<hi>latricall, qualified, secondary, improper, accidental co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adoration;</hi>
and such other his abstractive Notions of that
Worship, as do indeed befit a <hi>Nominal</hi> Philosopher, but
have no agreement with the avowed doctrines and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises
of the Roman Communion. Hence it is that in
the Discourse we are now upon, We read nothing of the
<hi>Dominus Deus Papa</hi> of the Canonists; Nothing of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car
of Christ; the Holy, Apostolick, and Infallible See
which their former Writers have endeavour'd to establish
<hi>Iure divino;</hi> Nothing of the Supreme Pastour, Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
and Head of Christ's Church, the Successor of S.
Peter, and other Titles which even our Representers of
late (whose business it hath been to mollifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>) have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd
us with; No not so much as of the <hi>modest Bishop
of Meaux's</hi> Primacy of S. Peter's chair and common
Center of Catholic Unity; but instead of these we are
told of a <hi>Western Patriarch,</hi> one who pleads the Prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of some Years for his Autority, and thinks himself
hardly dealt with,<note place="margin">pag. 21<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> that because He claims more then his
due, that which is his due should be denyed him. Hence
it seems to be that He is so wary in giving us his own
Opinions; that He disputes so much, and affirms so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;
that he bounds all his Positions with so many limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
that they seem contriv'd on purpose for subterfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
and that He very cautiously ventures not any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then He thinks, tho' falsly, the Autority of our
Writers will bear him out. Hence those Concessions
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48656:4"/>
(which will perhaps by that Party be judg'd over-libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall)
<q>That Images,<note place="margin">§. 117.</note> and so the veneration or worship
of them were very seldom, if at all, us'd in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church. That the publick Communion was then
most commonly, if not allways, administred in both
kinds unto the People. That the Divine Service which
then, as now, was celebrated usually in the Latin or
Greek Tongue, was much better in those days then
now understood of the Common people. That the
having the Liturgy, or Divine Service, or the Holy
Scriptures in a known tongue is not prohibited, nor
the using of Images enjoyn'd; nor the Priest's admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistring,
and the people's receiving the Communion in
both kinds, if the Supreme Church-Governours so
think fit</q> (and we say they ill discharge the Office of
Church-Governours, who do not <hi>think fit</hi> our Saviours
Institution should be observ'd) <q>declar'd unlawful by
any Canon of any Council.</q> Ancient Council he means,
for latter Councils have declar'd these unlawful. These
are large grants from a <hi>Romanist,</hi> and which give a great
shock to their so much magnified pretence of Universal
Tradition. Had this Author liv'd in those Ages when
the Secular Prince countenanc'd the beginnings of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
He would have scarce lost any thing for his too
rigorous adhaesion to the C. of Rome. For he thinks it
probable <q>that had the Reformation only translated the
former Church Liturgies and Scriptures into a known
tongue;<note place="margin">§. 118.</note> administred Communion in both kinds,
thought fit not to use Images; changed something of
practise only without any decession from the Churches
Doctrines, the Church-Governours would have been
facile to license these.</q> Where by the way it seems
something unintelligible how they should <hi>change practice</hi>
without <hi>decession</hi> from <hi>Doctrines,</hi> if Doctrines enjoyn'd
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48656:5"/>
such Practices,<note place="margin">pag 2. §. 2.</note> and if according to him, <hi>Errours in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
allways presuppose some Errour in matter of Faith.</hi>
But at least we may expect He would have <hi>outwardly</hi>
complied, since he notes, <q>That some outward compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
at the first,<note place="margin">pag. 140. §. 123.</note> of those Bishops, who made an open
Opposition afterward, might be upon a fair Pretence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the first Acts of the Reformation might not be so
insupportable as the latter.</q> Where it is worth our
Observing, that the very first Act, which gave life to the
Reformation, was shaking off all manner of Obedience to
the See of Rome, then which I believe his Holiness, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to this Author's Sentiments, thinks no Act more
unsupportable.</p>
            <p>These things consider'd, We could not have had a
more easie Adversary then this Gentleman, and the
Church has less reason to fear his open Opposition, then
had he still continued in her bosom. For it seems not
to be his Province to publish what is Material against
us, but to publish Much. But, God be thanked, our
Religion is not establish'd upon so weak a basis, as to be
overthrown by a few Theses unprov'd, and falsly appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
Nor is it any wonder if that arguer doth not
convince, who uses for Principles Conclusions drawn
from Praemisses, which the world never saw, and then as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes
such things as every one acquainted with Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story
is able to contradict. Certainly his University-Readers
will not be very fond of the Conclusion of that
Syllogism, whose Major is a <hi>petitio principii,</hi> &amp; Minor a
down-right fals-hood in matter of fact. They no doubt
are surpriz'd to find Consequents come before their Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents,
and Church-Government part the <hi>5th</hi> to have
stept into the World (somewhat immaturely methinks)
before the other four. But the Lawfulness of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Reformation was to be examin'd, and it would have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48656:5"/>
took up too much time to shew why he impos'd upon
us such a Test.</p>
            <p>It might therefore be thought seasonable enough
to examin the Truth of his Theses, when he shall be
pleas'd to communicate to us whence they are inferr'd.
In the meanwhile, it may not be unuseful to consider
what disservice he had done to our Cause, had his success
aequal'd the boldness of his attempt. After all his The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
and their Applications, his Correspondent Alpha's
and Beta's, his perplex'd Paragraphs, his intricate Parathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and his taedious Citations, what Doctrine of the
Church of Rome has he establish'd, or what principle of
Ours has he disprov'd? Should we grant that the Clergy
only have power in Controversies of Religion, that the
Secular Prince has no Autority to reform Errours in the
Church, that our Princes did wrongfully usurp such an
Autority, and that our Reformation was not the act of
the Clergy; will it hence follow (which yet is to be
prov'd by this Author, e're he can perswade us to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
any favourable Opinion of Popery) That the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Commandment ought to be expung'd out of the
Decalogue? that Idolatry is no Sin? or worshipping of
Images no Idolatry? that Transubstantiation is to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
in despight of Sense, Reason, Scripture, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity?
the Service of God to be administred in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
tongue, as it were in mere contradiction to
Saint Paul? and the Communion to be celebrated in
one kind notwithstanding our Saviours, <hi>Drink ye all
of this.</hi> It is indeed our happiness, that the Reformation
was carried on by the joynt concurrence of the Civil and
Ecclesiastical power; that We are united together by
common Rules for Government and Worship agree'd
on by the Bishops and Presbyters in Convocation, and
made Laws to us by the Autority of the Sovereign:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48656:6"/>
We are allways ready to prove that the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
being a National Church, and not Subject to any
forreign Jurisdiction, ow'd no Obedience to the Bishop or
Church of Rome, &amp; therefore might without their leave
reform her self, and that accordingly our Religion is
establish'd by such Laws as want no autority either Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
or Ecclesiastical, which they ought to have. This
is a Plea which we shall be allways prepar'd to justifie;
and a Blessing for which we thank God, and for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of which we shall never cease to pray. But
now had those which we esteem corruptions of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Church never been cast out, or were they reestab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
(which God in his mercy forbid) by as good au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority
as that by which they are now abolish'd; Yet even
then we could not submit to such Determinations, and
being concluded by an antecedent Obligation to God
durst not obey even lawful autority commanding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
things. He therefore that would gain a Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyte,
who acts upon prudent and Conscientious principles,
in vain entertains him with Schemes of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
since the things contested are such as no Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the world can make lawful; It would be more
rational to shew (were not that an attempt long since
despair'd of) that the particular doctrines and practises
to which we are invited, are agreeable to the word of
God; or that it doth not concern us, whether they be, or
not. For if either it may be prov'd, that the Errours
of the Church of Rome were so great, that there was a
necessity of reforming them, that every National Church
has a right to reform her self, that this right of the
Church of England in particular was unquestionable,
that she us'd no other then this her lawful right, and that
accordingly the Reformation was effected by the Major
part of the then legal Church-Governours: Or if in fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48656:6"/>
or this (which yet we say is far from being our case)
it may be prov'd, that where evident Necessity requires,
and the prevailing Errours are manifest, there the Civil
power may lawfully reform Religion without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
of the major part of the Clergy, for Secular
Interests averse from Reformation; Or if lastly, supposing
no such Reformation made by lawful authority, but the
Laws which enjoyn such erroneous Doctrines, remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in their full force and vigour, every private Christian
can plead an Exemption from his Obedience to them,
by proving them evidently contradictory to the known
laws of God; if any one of these Pleas are valid, all which
have by our Writers been prov'd to be so beyond the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility
of a fair Reply, then Nothing which is aim'd at
in these Papers can affect us, and tho' the author would
have shew'd more skill in proving his Question, yet he
had still betray'd his want of prudence in the choice
of it.</p>
            <p>By what hath been sayd, the Reader will be induc'd
to think that these Papers do not so much concern the
Church of England, as the State; and that a Reply to
them is not so properly the task of a Divine, as of a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer.
The Civil power is indeed manifestly struck at,
and an Answer might easily be fetcht from <hi>Keble</hi> and
<hi>Coke.</hi> He may perswade himself that he acts craftily,
but certainly he acts very inconsistently, who erects a
Triumphal Statue to his Prince, and at the same time
undermines his Autority; in monumental Inscriptions
gives him the glorious and astonishing Title of <hi>Optimus
Maximus,</hi> and yet sets up a superiour Power to his. If nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Loyalty nor gratitude could perswade him to speak
more rever<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ntly, yet out of wariness he ought to have
been more cautious in laying down such things, as seem
to have an ill aspect on his Majesties proceedings. For
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48656:7"/>
it may seem very rash to deny,<note place="margin">§. 5. p. 12.</note> that the Prince can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
from the Exercise of his Office any of his Clergy
for not obeying his Decisions in matters of a Spiritual
Nature, when a Reverend Prelate suffers under such a
Sentence;<note place="margin">§. 7. p. 14.</note> to assert that the Prince, ought not to collate
to Benefices, where the Clergy have Canonical excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
against the Person nominated, whilst a Friend of his
thus qualified enjoys the benefit of such a Collation; to
find fault with the Reformers that they gave their Prince
leave to dispense with Laws and Constitutions Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical,<note place="margin">§. 28. p. 36.</note>
when he himself is in that case most graciously
dispens'd with. How far the Regal power extends it
self in these cases, especially as it may be limited by the
municipal laws of the Realm, I am not so bold as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine;
but where such Rights are claim'd by the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign,
and actually exercis'd, there it becomes not the
modesty of a private Subject to be so open and liberal in
condemning them. But then above all he renders his
Loyalty justly questionable, when he tells us it is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
by the Roman Doctors, and leaves it a Question,
<q>Whether in case that a Prince use his coactive Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in Spiritual matters against the Definitions of
the Church,<note place="margin">§. 16. p. 20.</note> then the Pope hath not also virtually
some Temporal coactive power against the Prince?
namely to dissolve the Princes coactive Power, or to
authorise others to use a coactive power, against such
a Prince in order to the good of the Church?</q> Now I
appeal to the judicious Reader, whether the substance
of that infamous Libel, which was part of a late<note n="*" place="bottom">See Sidney's Trial.</note> Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour's
Indictment, and which was written by way of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemical
Discourse, as he pleaded, might not if manag'd
by this Author's pen have been thus warily exprest;
<q>Whether in case that a Prince use his coactive Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48656:7"/>
in Civil matters against Acts of Parliament, then
the Parliament hath not also virtually some tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
coactive power against the Prince; namely, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
the Princes coactive power, or to authorize others
to use a coactive power against such a Prince in order
to the good of the State?</q> Such bold Problems as these
ought not to be left undecided; and one who had any
zeal for his Prince, would scarce let the Affirmative side
of the Quaestion pass without affixing a brand on it.</p>
            <p>These Expressions among others He might well be
conscious would be offensive to any SIR <hi>of known Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and Loyalty to his Prince;</hi> and therefore such person's
good Opinion was to be courted in an Epistle Apologe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
But certainly it was expected that the kind <hi>Sir</hi>
should read no farther then the Epistle; for if he did, he
would find himself miserably impos'd upon. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
in this Epistle praeacquaints him with these things.</p>
            <q>
               <p>1. That there is nothing touch'd in this Discourse
concerning the Temporal Prince his Supreme power
in such matters, as it is dubious whether they be Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
or Temporal, but only in things which are pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spiritual and Ecclesiastical.</p>
               <p>2. That he knows not of any Ecclesiastical powers
in this Discourse denied to the Prince, but which, or at
least the chiefest of which, all other Christian Princes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
those of the Reformed states do forego to Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise.</p>
               <p>3. Nor of any, but which the Kings of England have
also foregone before <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Now I shall humbly beg leave to undeceive the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
<hi>Sir,</hi> and to represent to him that in all these he
is misinform'd. As to the first, 1. That there is nothing
touch'd in this Discourse concerning the Temporal
Prince his Supreme power in such Matters as it is dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48656:8"/>
whether they be Spiritual or Temporal but only
such as are purely Spiritual and Ecclesiastical.</p>
            <p>Now if by <hi>dubious</hi> he means such things as He does not
doubt, but they are Spiritual, then this doth not reach
our case; because <hi>We</hi> may <hi>doubt</hi> whether some things
are not Temporal, which He <hi>doubts</hi> not but they are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual;
But if by <hi>dubious</hi> He means such things as are
<hi>doubted</hi> by no body but that they are purely Spiritual,
then are we agreed; since neither do We allow the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Prince any power in things of which We our selves
<hi>doubt</hi> not but they are purely Spiritual. That there are
some Powers merely Spiritual, appropriated to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
and incommunicable to the Prince, no true Son of
the Church of England will deny; but now altho' the
substance of those Powers be immediately from God, and
not from the King, as those of Preaching, Ordaining,
Absolving &amp;c. Yet whether these are not subject to be
limited, inhibited, or otherwise regulated in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Exercise of them by the Laws of the Land, and the
Autority Regal is the thing quaestion'd. This cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
be better exprest then in the words of the Reverend
Bp. <hi>Sanderson;</hi> 
               <q>The King doth not challenge to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
as belonging to him by Virtue of his Supremacy
Ecclesiastical the power of Ordaining Ministers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating
scandalous Offenders, or doing any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
act of Episcopal Office in his own Person; nor
the power of Preaching, Administring the Sacraments,
or doing any other act of Ministerial Office in his own
person: but leaves the performance of all such acts of
either sort unto such persons, as the said several respe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
powers do of divine right belong to, <hi>viz.</hi> of the
one sort to the Bishops, and of the other to the Priests.<note n="*" place="bottom">Episcopacy not prejud. to Reg power. p 22</note>
Yet doth the King by Virtue of that Supremacy chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
a power as belonging to him in the right of his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48656:8"/>
Crown, to make Laws as well concerning Preaching,
Administring the Sacraments, and other acts belonging
to the Function of a Priest, as concerning Ordination
of Ministers, proceeding in matters of Ecclesiastical
Cognisance in the Spiritual Courts, and other acts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Function of a Bishop: to which Laws as
well the Priests, as the Bishops are subject, and ought to
submit to be limited and regulated thereby in the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of those their several respective Powers; their claim
to a <hi>Ius Divinum,</hi> and that their said several powers are
of God notwithstanding.</q> Now to apply this; That
the deciding Controversies of Faith, and Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
Offenders, &amp;c. are the proper Province of the
Clergy, we deny not; but that the indicting Synods in
order to such Matters, or making Laws to regulate the
Exercise of them are purely Spiritual, is not so <hi>undoubted</hi>
as He would perswade us. Again, that the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Autority which is to be exercised in the Episcopal or
Sacerdotal Functions can be derived from none but those
spiritual persons who were invested with that Autority,
and power of delegating it to others, is willingly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd;
but that collation to Benefices can be the act of
none but the Clergy will not be hence infer'd. For the
Spiritual Autority it self, and the application of it to
such an Object are very different things. The power
by which a Clergy man is capacitated for his Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is derived from the Bishop which ordains him; but
the applying this Power to such a Place, the ordering
that the Ecclesiastical Person shall execute that Autority
which he deriv'd from the Church in such a peculiar part
of the Kingdom is not without the reach of the Civil Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction;
and therefore Collation to Benefices (in the
sence this Author understands it) should not have been
reckon'd by him amongst those things of which it is not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48656:9"/>
               <hi>doubted</hi> but they are purely Spirituall. Another power of
which he abridges the Prince, and by consequence would
have to be esteem'd purely Spiritual, is the deposing
from the Exercise of their Office in his Dominions any
of the Clergy for transgressing of the Ecclesiastical Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons.
Now that the Secular Prince should have an
Obligation from God over all Persons in all Spiritual
matters to bind them by Temporal Punishments to the
Obedience of the Churches or Clergy's determinations,
and decrees (as he words it) and yet that the Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
this power, their performing what they are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to by God, should be without the reach of their
Autority, seems to me a paradox. That the Christian
Emperors in the Primitive times challeng'd such a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
is plain from the undoubted testimony of the
Learned <hi>Petrus de Marca.</hi>

1st. By delegating Magistrates to see they were observ'd.
2ly. By punishing those who were guilty of the breach
of them. And he particularly mentions Deprivation
inflicted by the Secular power for violation of the
Canons.<note n="*" place="bottom">In manifestissima violatione, <hi>canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> factam injuriam iis poenis Principes ulsciscebantur, quae legibus irrogatae e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, nempe expulsione à sede.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48656:9"/>
within the reach of their Jurisdiction, tho' not Degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
which is a punishment merely Ecclesiastical.
(Which neither did the Reforming Princes ever think
in their power to inflict.) And he<note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> there gives instances
of Bishops so depriv'd. And indeed this seems to be
a Necessary branch of power, which naturally flows
from his being <hi>Custos Canonum,</hi> which he is prov'd by
this Author at large to be. How far the Prince may
abridge himself of this power by the laws of the Land,
I meddle not; it suffices to shew that it is not origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
a power merely Spirituall. And from this and the
former Instances the Reader will be able to judge the
truth of that assertion, That there is nothing touch'd
in this Discourse concerning such Matters, as it is <hi>dubious</hi>
whether they be Spiritual, or Temporal.</p>
            <p>Come we now to that other assertion of his, <q>That
he knows not of any Ecclesiastical powers in this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse
denied to the Prince but which (or at least
the chiefest of which) all other Christian Princes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
those of the Reformed States do forego to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now if by the <hi>chiefest,</hi> which he excepts, he means
preaching the word, and administring the Sacraments,
Excommunicating, and absolving; neither do the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
States challenge the Exercise of these; and as for
others it will appear that the Princes of the Roman-Catholick
Communion extend their Supermacy as far
as the Reformed.</p>
            <p>And here it may not be improper to instance in that
right which the Kings of Spain enjoy in Sicily, which
seems to extend even to those Spiritual powers which
our Author calls the <hi>chiefest.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Hist. of Eccl, Rev by a Learned Priest in France. p. 116.</note> And this I find usher'd
in by a Roman-Catholick Writer with an assertion quite
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48656:10"/>
opposite to that which is laid down in this Epistle.
<q>It even surpasses (saith he) that which <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth
of <hi>England</hi> boldly took when he separated from the
Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> The King of <hi>Spain</hi> as King of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cily</hi>
pretends to be Legate <hi>à latere,</hi> and born Legate
of the H. See; so that he and his Viceroys in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
have the same power over the <hi>Sicilians</hi> as to
the Spiritual that a Legate <hi>à latere</hi> could have. And
therefore they who execute that Jurisdiction of <hi>Sicily</hi>
for the King of <hi>Spain</hi> have power to absolve, punish,
and excommunicate all sorts of persons, whether La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks
or Ecclesiasticks, Monks, Priests, Abbots, Bishops,
and even Cardinals themselves, that reside in the
Kingdom. They acknowledge not the Popes Auto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
being Sovereign Monarchs as to the Spiritual.
They confess that the Pope hath heretofore given
them that priviledge: (<hi>So that his Holiness it seemes
thought even those chiefest Powers of the Church alienable)</hi>
but at the same time they pretend that it is not in
his power to recall it; and so they acknowledge not
the Pope for head, to whose Tribunal no Appeal can
be made because their King has no Superiour, as to
the Spiritual. Moreover this right of superiority is
not consider'd as delegate, but proper; and the King
of Sicily or they who hold Jurisdiction in his place,
and who are Lay-men take the title of <hi>Beatissimo &amp;
Santissimo Padre</hi> attributing to themselves in effect in
respect of <hi>Sicily</hi> what the Pope takes to himself in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of the whole Church; and they preside in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
Councils.</q> As for the title of <hi>Head</hi> of the
Church which taken by the Reformers so much offends
our Discourser, this Critical Historian farther observes;
<q>It was matter of great astonishment that in our age
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> took the title of <hi>Head</hi> of the Church
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48656:10"/>
of <hi>England.</hi> But seeing in the Kingdom of <hi>Sicily,</hi>
the Female succeeds as well as in <hi>England,</hi> a Princess
may take the title of <hi>Head</hi> of the Church of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and
of <hi>Beatissimo &amp; Santissimo Padre.</hi> Nay it hath happen'd
so already in the time of <hi>Iean</hi> of <hi>Arragon</hi> &amp; <hi>Castile</hi> the
mother of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>5th: So that this Critick concludes
that</hi> it may be said there are two Popes, and two sacred
Colledges in the Church, to wit, the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and the Pope of <hi>Sicily,</hi> to whom also may be added
the Pope of <hi>England.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>What Jurisdiction Spiritual the King of <hi>France</hi> chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges

of the Canons doth belong to the King, it thence
follows that He can command that they be observ'd
without expecting the sentence of the Gallican Church?
He answers, * that it is indeed certain that the Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of them will be the more sacred, if they be made
with the Universal consent of the Clergy, because eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one desires that that should take place, which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
approves of: But then, that it is aequally certain,
that the King with the advice of his Council, may by
his Edicts decree, that the Canons be observ'd, and may
add such Modes and Circumstances as are necessary for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48656:12"/>
the better Execution of them, and accommodate them
to the Interest of the State.</q> This Autority he confirms
from the Examples of the first Christian Emperors, and
the former French Kings, and adds expresly<note n="*" place="bottom">Utuntur adhuc eo jure Reges Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stianissimi. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the revising of the Canons by the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
especially when humbly besought to do it by the
Clergy, should not be an Invasion of the Churches rights,
when the French Kings even without such Interposition
of the Church, exercise the same Right, and yet do, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to <hi>our Auther,</hi> leave to the management of the
Clergy all power in Spirituals. I might here insist upon
Collation of Benefices, which the French Kings challenge
by right of the <hi>Regale;</hi> but I shall choose rather to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the assembling of Councils, because a French King
in the last Century seems to have <hi>doubted</hi> whether his
Clergy might convene without his consent; as appears
from that bold Speech of his Embassadour in the Council
of Trent, which because it gives us some insight into the

to the Command of <hi>Pius</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> All his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and decrees we refuse, reject, and contemn; and
although, most Holy Fathers, Your Religion, Life, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48656:12"/>
Learning was ever and ever shall be of great Autority
with Us, Yet seeing <hi>You</hi> do nothing, but all things are
manag'd rather at <hi>Rome,</hi> then at <hi>Trent;</hi> and the things
that are here publish'd are rather the <hi>Placita</hi> of <hi>Pius</hi> the
<hi>4th,</hi> then the Decrees of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> We de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
and <hi>protest</hi> here before You all, that whatsoever
things are decree'd in this Assembly by the will and
pleasure of <hi>Pius,</hi> neither the Most Christian King will
ever approve, nor the French Church ever acknowledge
for the Decrees of an Oecumenical Council. In the
mean time the Most Christian King commands all you
his Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Abbots, Doctors, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
to depart hence; then to return, when it shall
please God to restore to his Catholick Church the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
methods and liberty of General Councils, and to
the Most Christian King his Honour and Dignity.</q>
Now I leave it to the Reader to judge whether any
Reformed States ever assumed to themselves greater Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tority
over the Ecclesiasticks, then this R. Catholick
Prince, or Whether ever any Protestant exprest himself
with greater warmth concerning this Council, then that
<hi>Protesting</hi> Embassador. It might be easie to shew how
much power the <hi>Venetian</hi> Republick exercises in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals,
had not this been done so lately by another Pen.
But what hath been said may suffice to evince, that this
Epistolographer impos'd upon the credulity of his <hi>Sir,</hi>
when he told him, <q>that he knew of no Ecclesiastical
powers denied to the Prince but which (or at least the
chiefest of which) all other Christian Princes, except
those of the Reformed State, do forego to exercise.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But our Discourser perhaps presum'd his Friend a
Stranger to sorreign affairs, and therefore thought he
might the more securely use a Latitude in his treating
of those; it remains therefore to examine whether he
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48656:13"/>
has been a more faithful Relator of our own History,
and what truth there is in his last Epistolary assertion,
that <q>he knows not of any Ecclesiastical powers in
this Discourse denied to the Prince, but what the
Kings of <hi>England</hi> have foregone before <hi>Henry the 8th.</hi>
               </q>
Now whatever in relation to a power in Spirituals is
in this Discourse accus'd of Nov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lty seems easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
to these two Heads:</p>
            <p>1st. A Supremacy in Causes Ecclesiastical denied to
the <hi>Western Patriarch:</hi> as appears by our Princes taking
away all manner of Forreign Jurisdiction, prohibiting
all appeals to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> all Bulls from it, and in
generall all Intercourse with it.</p>
            <p>2ly. The same Supremacy invested in the Sovereign;
as appears by King <hi>Henry's</hi> assuming the title of <hi>Head</hi>
of the Church; by the Kings making Ecclesiastical Laws;
by that Synodical act of the Clergy not to assemble or
promulgate any Canons without his leave; by that
power granted to the King to visit Ecclesiastical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and to reform Errours and Heresies; by his col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to Benefices without consent of the Clergy; and
by hindring Excommunications <hi>in foro externo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in Answer to this charge of Novelty; It is
confest that the Pope did for some Years usurp such a
superiority; but then, as it is granted that he did <hi>de fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto</hi>
claim such a power, so that it did <hi>de jure</hi> belong to
him is denied; and not only so, but farther we affirm,
that he neither from the beginning challenged such a
power, nor was he afterwards in so full possession of
it, but that our Princes have upon Occasion vindicated
their own right against all Papal, or, if he pleaseth, <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchal</hi>
Encroachments. And here waving the dispute
of <hi>right</hi> I shall confine my self to matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> that
being the only case here controverted.</p>
            <p>

pass'd over, that in reciting the Decalogue, the second
Commandment concerning the not making of graven
Images was according to the use of the <hi>2d</hi> Nicene
Council, which was celebrated an 100 Years before,
in its place omitted. But that this defect might be
supplied out of the context of the Holy Bible, after
that which we call the Tenth Commandment, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was added to complete the just Number, in these
words, Thou shalt not make to thy self any Gods of
Gold; Which being added by the King himself as it
doth argue the Church to have been corrupt in her
Doctrine, so it is a testimony of the Kings Orthodoxy.</q>
From which one Instance it is plain that, contrary to
the pretensions of our Author, King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th</hi>
was not the <hi>1st</hi> that took upon him to Reform Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies;
for King <hi>Alfred</hi> here restores the Decalogue to
its primitive Integrity: to judge what is agreeable to
the word of God; for He supply's the defect, which
he finds in the Missal, from the Scriptures: to judge
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48656:17"/>
contrary to the Determinations of the Church; for the
Church is here said to have been corrupt in that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
in which the King was Orthodox; to alter the
Constitutions of General Councils because repugnant
to the law of God; for this Omission of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was <hi>ex usu secundi Concilii Niceni,</hi> and the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
of Images here forbidden was introduc'd by
that Council which the Romanists acknowledge Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.
These passages cited I take to be some of the
<hi>perperam scripta</hi> which the Publisher of that life men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

whatsoever is advanc'd against the Papal Autority in
the Text is qualified in the Comment, and it is plain
that King <hi>Alfred</hi> was a greater Adversary to the power
of the Pope then his <hi>Alumnus</hi> the Annotator; so that it
is matter of surprize to find him appear in the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tispiece

was so great an Enemy to the Anti-regal designs of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>3ly.</hi> As to the power of calling Synods, we need no
more to clear this point then the very words of the
Statute by him urg'd. 25 <hi>Hen. 8. c.</hi> 19. Where it is
said, <q>that the Kings Humble and Obedient Subjects
the Clergy of the Realm of England had acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd
according to the truth that the Convocation
of the same Clergy is, always hath been, and ought
to be assembled only by the Kings Writ.</q> Which is
farther evident from the ancient from of calling and
dissolving Synods by a Writ in each case directed to
the Arch-Bishop of Canterbury, as may be seen in D<hi rend="sup">r</hi>.
<hi>Heylin</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Ref, Justif. p. J. C. 2.</note> The Clergy did indeed before this act of
King <hi>Henry 8th</hi> promulge and execute those Canons
by their own autority, which they here promise not to

put in Execution without the King's consent. But since
no such Canons could be put in ure till made; nor be
made but by the Clergy assembled, nor the Clergy be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled

               <hi>5thly.</hi> As for Collation of Benefices. Our learned Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
assure us that all the Bishopricks are of the King's
Foundation, and that they were Originally Donative,
not Elective; and that the full right of Investitures was
in the Sovereign who signified his pleasure therein <hi>per

               <hi>And it is there said, That</hi>
Elections were first granted by the King's Progenitors
upon a certain form and Eondition, as to demand Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense

were not kept, the thing ought in reason to resort

            <p>Lastly as for Hindring Excommunications <hi>in foro exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi>
It is one of the Articles of <hi>Clarendon;</hi> That None
that hold of the King in capite nor any of his Houshold
Servants may be Excommunicated, nor their Land in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted,
unless our Lord the King, if he be in the
Kingdom, be first treated with, or his Iustice, if he be
abroad; so that he may do what is Right concerning him.
And amongst the <hi>Articuli Cleri. c.</hi> 7. It is complain'd that
the King's Letters us'd to be directed to Ordinaries that
have wrapt their Subjects in Sentence of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that they should assoil them by a certain day, or else
that they do appear and answer, wherefore they excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
them. This short account, however imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
may suffice to shew that the Regal power in <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals</hi>
challeng'd by King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th</hi> was not quitted
by his Predecessors. And if the Reader desires a more
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48656:18"/>
full account of these things I shall refer him to Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond's</hi>

Sch. guarded c. 12. Sect. 3. as also to Sr. <hi>Roger Twisden</hi>
in his Historical vindication of the C. of <hi>England</hi> in point
of Schism; which Learned Author has by a through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
into History, Law-books, Registers, and other Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents
of Antiquity enabled himself to give full and
ample satisfaction to every unpraejudic'd Reader concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this Subject; and to convince him that this Author
knew very little either of the <hi>English</hi> History or of his
own Book, if He knew not of <hi>any</hi> Ecclesiastical powers in
this Discourse denied to the Prince, but which were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone
by the Kings of <hi>England</hi> before <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth.</p>
            <p>As for what he adds, <q>that no more Supremacy in
such Ecclesiastical matters,<note place="margin">Ep.</note> as are delegated by Christ
to the Clergy and are unalienable by them to any Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
power, can belong to the Princes of one time or
of one Nation, then do to any other Prince of a former
Time, or a diverse Nation,</q> We willingly acknowledge
it, since no such powers belong to <hi>any</hi> Prince, at <hi>any</hi> time,
or of <hi>any</hi> Nation. But then there is a Supremacy in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
matters delegated by God to the Prince, which
may be invaded by a Forreigner under a forg'd pretence
of his being Head of the Church; and here Secular
Laws may be made for the protection of such Rights, and
for the punishment of those who shall either invade them,
or vindicate such Invasion. And that person who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
praetext of <hi>maintaining the Churches rights</hi> shall impugn
the just Autority of his Sovereign <hi>may be more a disloyal
Subject in these days,</hi> when this Authority is by the Laws
vindicated from Forreign Usurpation, <hi>then he would have
been in those days,</hi> when such Usurpation was tolerated,
and conniv'd at.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:48656:19"/>Having dwelt hitherto on the <hi>Epistle,</hi> and discover'd
so much Insincerity in that, which yet was to bespeak
the Reader's good Opinion of the ensuing Discourse,
We have no great reason to expect any fairer dealing
in the prosecution of his design. And here I shall be
excus'd if I be the shorter in the Examination of his
<hi>Theses,</hi> both because they are such as being propos'd
only and not prov'd, it lies in our power to accept, or
reject them at pleasure; as also because they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
undergone the Censure of a Noble Pen, and have
not been able to abide a fair Tryall. Some of them
are so ambiguously exprest that they may be either true
or false according to the different construction they are
capable of. The fals-hood of others is self-evident;
But then for the better vending of these, some truths
are intermix'd according to the policy of <hi>Luther's</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagonist
observ'd by his Biographer<note n="*" place="bottom">Consid. concerning Luther §. 48. p. 90.</note>, <q>Who, to make
his bad wares saleable, diligently mixeth some small
stock of good with evil, so to make this more cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
and all easily swallow'd down together by the
imprudent and credulous.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Another Artifice much practis'd by our Author is
that he lays down his Propositions in general terms,
but afterwards restrains them by such limitations, which
if adher'd to would make them utterly disserviceable to
his Cause; but then when they come to be applied, the
<hi>These</hi> are refer'd to at large without any regard to such
limitations. Thus when in his first <hi>Thesis</hi> he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
<q>That it is not in the just power of the Prince
to deny giving the Ministers of Christ license to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
their Office,<note place="margin">§. 3. p 4.</note> and their Ecclesiastical Censures in
his Dominions,</q> He means he saith in general, for he
meddles not with the Prince, his denying some of them
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48656:19"/>
to do these things whilst he admits others. Now if
this Restraint be observ'd, then all which he would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish
from this <hi>Thesis</hi> will come to Nothing. For
he will not, I believe, presume to say that the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Princes ever laid a general Interdict upon all the
Clergy to prohibit them the exercise of their Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical
Functions. This is an Act which the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
detests, and which we leave to the charitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Universal Pastor, who by Virtue of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's
Command of <hi>Pasce oves;</hi> challenges to himself a
power of depriving the flock of all Spiritual food. Thus
again,<note place="margin">§. 5. p. 12.</note> When in his third <hi>Thesis</hi> he has asserted that the
Secular Prince cannot eject from the exercise of their
Office in his Dominions any of the Clergy, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
the <hi>Patriarch</hi> from any Autority which he
stands possest of by Ecclesiastical Canons, He restrains
such Canons to those only <hi>that cannot justly be pretended
to do any wrong to the Civil Government.</hi> Now he knows
that all Canons which would obtrude upon us a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
usurp'd Autority are by us <hi>pretended</hi> (whether
<hi>justly</hi> or not, they will best judge who impartially weigh
our Reasons) <hi>injurious to the Civil Government.</hi> Another
Limitation of this <hi>Thesis</hi> is <q>that the Civil power may
judge,<note place="margin">§. 8. p. 16.</note> and eject, and disauthorize Spiritual Persons
for Moral and Civil Misdemeanors damageable to the
Common-Wealth;</q> But this Limitation is forgot when
from this <hi>Thesis</hi> He would prove the ejection of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops,
in Queen <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> time unlawful; For their
Deprivation was for refusing the Oath of Supremacy
made first by Roman-Catholicks in King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th's</hi>
time, and reviv'd by Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> so that the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of it depends merely on the Right of the Civil
power to make Oaths for the better security of their
Government, and to impose such Penalties as are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48656:20"/>
in the Law on the Violators; and if such Refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
be damageable to the Common-Wealth (as it was
then judg'd) then the Deprivation of those Refusers
will be justifiable according to his own Principles.
Thus again in his <hi>8th Thesis</hi> When he has laid down,
<q>That as for things of meer Ecclesiastical Constitution,<note place="margin">§. 14. p. 18.</note>
Neither National Synod, nor Secular power may
make any New Canons contrary to the Ecclesiastical
Constitutions of former Superior Councils, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
those formerly made by them.</q> He restrains it
to those only <hi>as neither the Prince can shew some way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to his Civil Government, nor the National</hi> Synod
<hi>can shew more prejudicial to their particular Church, then the
same Constitutions are to the rest of Christian Churches.</hi>
(Where by the way methinks it should suffice if they
were aequally prejudicial, for one Church is never the
less wrong'd because another suffers.) Now we desire no
more then the benefit of this limitation; for if the Prince
may reverse such Constitutions when <hi>prejudicial to Civil
Government,</hi> and the National Synod when <hi>praejudicial to
their particular Church,</hi> and each of these are Judges of
such praejudice, (for neither doth AEquity admit, nor doth
He appoint any other Arbiter) then each of these have
as much power granted them as they challenge, which
is only to alter such Constitutions as are prejudicial to
them. Having praemis'd thus much in general, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
the Reader against this piece of Sophistry, which
runs through the greatest part of this Discourse, I shall
now proceed to a particular survey of his <hi>Theses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the first and second, I shall at present grant him
that favour which he seems to request of all his Readers,
<hi>i. e.</hi> suppose them to be true, and shall content my self on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to examin what Inferences he deduces from them.
And here I cannot but commend his Policy for setting
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48656:20"/>
his <hi>Conclusions</hi> at so great a distance from his <hi>Praemisses,</hi> for
they are commonly such as would have by no means a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
to stand too nigh together.</p>
            <p>From his first and second <hi>Thesis,</hi> 
               <q>that the Clergy have
power to determine Controversies in pure matters of
Religion, and to judge what is divine truth, what are
Errors; &amp; that they cannot alienate this Power to the
Secular Prince;</q>
               <note place="margin">§. 22. p. 29.</note> he infers That that Synodical Act of
the Clergy in K. <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time, whereby they
promise not to Assemble without the King's Writ, nor
when Assembled to execute any Canons without the
King's consent, is unlawful. Now it is to be observed that
the Clergy neither do deny that they have a Power to
determine Controversies in pure matters of Religion,
which is what the first <hi>Thesis</hi> would prove; nor do they
transfer such a Power on the King, which might be against
the Tenor of the second. The utmost which can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
hence is, That the Clergy did for prudential mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
limit themselves in the Exercise of one branch of
their Spiritual Power; and it will be difficult for this
Author to prove that He, who has a power <hi>jure divino,</hi>
may not by <hi>humane Laws</hi> be limited in the Use of it.
Husbands have a power over their Wives, Fathers
over their Children, and Masters over their Servants by
the <hi>Law of God,</hi> and yet this power may be regulated by
the <hi>Laws of the Land.</hi>
               <note place="margin">§. 27. p. 36.</note> Thus the Priest has a power to
bind and loose from our Saviour's Commission, and yet
according to this Author, before the Reformation the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
Clergy might not exercise any Church Censure
contrary to the Commands of their lawful Spiritual Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior.
Thus also if a General Council have power to
determine matters of Faith, then according to his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
they have power to convene in order to such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination,
and this power of theirs is unalienable; and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48656:21"/>
yet the Romanists will not allow that such Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
may be made at pleasure, but that the <hi>hic &amp; nunc</hi>
are determinable by the Pope, who only has power
to indict Councils, and to give Autority to those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,
which yet derive their power from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil's
being infallible, and from the Holy Ghost assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them.</p>
            <p>Another Act, which from the same <hi>Thesis</hi> he accuses
of Injustice,<note place="margin">§. 25. p. 31.</note> is <q>the Clergy's beseeching the King's High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
that the Constitutions and Canons Provincial and
Synodal, which be thought prejudicial to the King's
Prerogative Royal, or repugnant to the Laws and
Statutes of this Realm, or to be otherwise overmuch
onerous to his Highness and his Subjects may be
committed to the judgment of his Highness, and of
32 Persons, 16 of the Temporalty, and 16 of the
Clergy of this Realm to be chosen and appointed by
the King's Majesty, and that such Canons, as shall be
thought by the more part of them worthy to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null'd,
shall be made of no value, and such other of
the Canons as shall be approv'd to stand with the Law
of God &amp;c. shall stand in power.</q> Now it is to be
consider'd that the Laws, which the Clergy here desire
may be revis'd, are of a far different Nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Inspection of them may well be committed
to different Judges. Some of them were suppos'd <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to the King's Praerogative Royal, or repugnant to the
Laws of the Realm,</hi> and here the Lay-Commissioners, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
persons of the upper and lower House of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
(see the Stat.) were the best Judges; Of others
it was to be enquir'd Whether they were <hi>agreeable to
the word of God or not,</hi> and here the Clergy were ready
to give their Determination. And altho' they both
acted in a joynt Commission yet no good reason seems
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48656:21"/>
assignable why both Lay and Ecclesiastical Judges should
be appointed, but that, the matters to be examin'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of different cognizance, those which related to <hi>Civil</hi>
Affairs should be determin'd by the <hi>Temporalty,</hi> those
which were of a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Nature by the <hi>Spiritualty.</hi>
And if so, then the deciding of these matters is not
transfer'd from the Spiritualty to the Temporalty, but
from one part of the Clergy to another. And this He
himself, after all his descants upon this Act, confesseth,
For,<note place="margin">§. 26. lb.</note> 
               <q>whatever sense the words in the Praeface of this
Act were or may be extended to, I do not think
the Clergy at first intended any such thing, as to make
the King or his Commissioners Judges of matters
of Faith or Divine truth:</q> and for this Opinion of
his He gives us his Reasons in that, and the subsequent
pages.</p>
            <p>Another Act, which is by this Author judg'd contrary
to his first <hi>Thesis,</hi> is that Statute of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth
which orders <q>that no speaking, holding,<note place="margin">§ 34. p. 39.</note> or doing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
any Laws call'd Spiritual Laws made by
Autority of the See of Rome, which be repugnant to
the Laws and Statutes of the Realm, or the King's Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
shall be deem'd to be Haeresie, from which he
infers that the King and Parliament undertake to be
Judges of Haeresie.</q> Now the King and Parliament do
not here in my Opinion take upon them to decide mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith, but only to Enact that in such a case the
Subject shall not suffer the Punishment usually inflicted
on Haereticks; Whether such speaking or doing be Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie
or not, they have power to ordain that it shall not
be deem'd so <hi>i. e.</hi> the Speaker shall not suffer as an Haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.
Something parallel to this we have in that <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of much concernment</hi> (to use our Author's expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of another Act) made 23. <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 1. Wherein it is
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48656:22"/>
enacted that <hi>The Persons who shall withdraw any of the
Queens Majesties Subjects from the Religion established
by Law to the Romish Religion, shall be to all intents ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd
as Traytors, and shall suffer as in cases of High
Treason, and the like of Persons willingly reconcil'd.</hi>
Where without disputing whether every such Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciler,
or Reconciled, is necessarily for that Act <hi>ipso facto</hi>
a Traytor, all that is here enacted is that he shall suffer
as such; For it is undoubtedly within the reach of the
Civil Power to ordain where they will inflict or not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
their Secular Punishments, without being accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
for this to any Autority under God's. And it seems
very hard that if a Subject expresses himself, or acts against
such Laws of a Forreigner as are repugnant to the Laws
of his own Country, there the Prince cannot exempt
him from a Writ <hi>de Haeretico comburendo</hi> without invad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Churches right.</p>
            <p>Another Act condemn'd by Virtue of his <hi>1st</hi> and <hi>2d

            <p>Another Inference, which he deduces from these <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi>
is the Unlawfulness of the Oath of Supremacy.<note place="margin">§. 185. p. 214.</note> Now

               <q>The King's Majesty
has the chief power in this Realm of England, and
other his Dominions: Unto whom the chief Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all Estates of this Realm, whether they be Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
or Civil, in all causes doth appertain, and is
not or ought not to be subject to any forreign Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</q>
So far for the extent of this power; but now
for the restraint. <q>Where we attribute to the King's
Majesty the chief Government, by which Titles we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the minds of some <hi>slanderous folks</hi> to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
We give not to our Prince the ministring ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of God's word, or of the Sacraments, the which thing
the Injunctions also, lately set forth by Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> do
most plainly testify, but that only Prerogative which
We see to have been given always to all Godly Princes
in Holy Scriptures by God himself, that is, that they
should rule all Estates and degrees committed to their
charge by God, whether they be Ecclesiastical or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral,
and restrain with the Civil Sword the Stubborn
&amp; evil doers.</q> It is therefore by our Author to be prov'd
that they who give no more to their Prince, then <hi>hath
been given always to all Godly Princes in Holy Scripture by God
himself,</hi> do alienate to the Secular Governour any Autori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or Office which they (the Clergy) have receiv'd and
been charg'd with by Christ, with a command to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute
the same to the end of the World; which being a
Contradiction I leave it to him to reconcile.</p>
            <p>That by this Oath, or any other Act of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>
a greater Power was either assum'd by herself,
or given to her by Others, then is consistent with that
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48656:23"/>
Autority that is given by our Saviour to the Church
will be very difficult for any Reasonable man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
who shall have recourse to the Injunction of this
Queen to which this very Article refers us; <q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Sparrow's Collection pag. 83. Lond. 1684.</note> Where
she declares that she neither doth nor ever will chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
any Autority, but what was challeng'd and lately
us'd by the Noble Kings of famous memory King <hi>Henry</hi>
the <hi>8th,</hi> and King <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th,</hi> which is and <hi>was
of Ancient time</hi> due to the Imperial Crown of this
Realm; that is, under God to have Sovereignty and
Rule over all manner of Persons born within these
her Realms, Dominions, and Countreys, of what E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state
either Ecclesiastical or Temporal soever they be;
so as no other forreign Power shall or ought to have
any Superiority over them. And if any Person that
hath conceited any other sense of the form of the said
Oath, shall accept the same Oath with this Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
sense, or meaning; Her Majesty is well pleas'd
to accept every such in that behalf as her good and
Obedient Subjects; and shall acquit them of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of penalties contain'd in the act therein men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
against such as shall peremptorily and obstinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refuse to take the same Oath.</q> So that it's evident
from this Injunction that it's no way here stated what
Autority belongs to the Church, and what to the Civil
Magistrate, farther then that the Queen (as justly she
might) challenged what was due of Ancient time to
the Imperial Crown of this Realm, and neither did
nor would challenge more; but what that was, is not
here determin'd; and she is content without such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination,

               <hi>Thesis</hi> is King <hi>Henry the 8th's</hi> claiming a right that no
Clergy-man, being a Member of the Church of England,
should exercise the power of the Keys in his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions

in the first <hi>Thesis</hi> have reference to the things only of
the <hi>next</hi> world; but the censures here spoken of, are such
as have reference to the things of <hi>this</hi> world. The Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Jurisdiction of Bishops flows, we confess, from their
Ordination; but the Actual exercise thereof in publick
Courts after a coercive manner is from the gracious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions
of Sovereign Princes.</p>
            <p>From the <hi>1st</hi> and <hi>2d Thesis</hi> 
               <q>he farther condemns the
taking away the Patriarch's Autority for receiving of
Appeals,<note place="margin">pag. 99.</note> and exercising final Judicature in Spiritual
Controversies, as also the taking away the final judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and decision of such Controversies not only from
the Patriarch in particular, but also from all the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy
in general, not making the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi>
or Convocation, but himself or his Substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
the Judges thereof.</q> For which he refers us
to <hi>Stat. 25. H. 8. 19. c.</hi> But in that Statute I find no
mention of a <hi>Patriarch,</hi> or <hi>Spiritual Controversies,</hi> but
only that in causes of Contention having their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement
within the Courts of this Realm no Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
shall be made out of it to the Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but
to the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and for want of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
in his Courts to the King in Chancery; Upon
which a Commission shall be directed to such Persons
as shall be appointed by the King definitively to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
such Appeals. Here is nothing of <hi>determining Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
in pure matters of Religion, of deciding what is
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48656:24"/>
Gods word, and divine Truth, what are Errors in the faith
or in the practise of Gods Worship, and Service,</hi> nor any
of the other <hi>Spiritual</hi> powers by him enumerated in
the <hi>1st Thesis;</hi> Or if any such Quaestions should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd
in the Causes to be tried, Why may not the
Commissioners, if Secular, judge according to what has
been praedetermin'd, by the Clergy? or let us suppose a
case never yet determin'd, How doth he prove a power
of judging in such causes transfer'd on secular Persons,
since if Occasion requir'd, the Delegates might be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
Ecclesiastical?</p>
            <p>But not only the Acts of <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> but the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
of our Doctors are to be examin'd by his Test,<note place="margin">p 240.</note>
and therefore from the same <hi>Theses</hi> he censures that As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
of Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Heylins Ref. Justified, part. 1. §. 6.</note> that it is neither fit nor reasonable
that the Clergy should be able by their Synodical Acts
to conclude both Prince and People in <hi>Spiritual</hi> matters,
until the stamp of Royal Autority be imprinted on them.
Now it is plain to any one that views the Context, that
the Dr. speaks of such a concluding the Prince and people
in matters <hi>Spiritual,</hi> as hath influence on their <hi>Civil</hi> rights.
For he there discourses of the Clergy under King <hi>Henry</hi>
obliging themselves not to execute those Ecclesiastical
Canons without the <hi>Kings</hi> consent which formerly they
had put in Execution by their <hi>own</hi> Autority. But the
Canons so executed had the force of <hi>Civil</hi> Laws, and the
Violators of them were obnoxious to <hi>Secular</hi> punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
The Dr. therefore very justly thought it unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
any should be liable to such Punishments with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>His</hi> consent, who only has the power of inflicting
them; Nor is this inconsistent with our Authors first <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>
(had he at so great a distance remembred it) which
extends Church-Autority only to Ecclesiastical Censures,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48656:24"/>
which have reference to things not of this, but the next
World.</p>
            <p>These are the Inferences which I find deduc'd, from
his first and second <hi>Theses</hi> in the several parts of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
which had they been as conclusive, as they are
false, yet I do not find but that his own party (if that be
the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi>) had suffer'd most by them. For if
the Supremacy given to King <hi>Henry</hi> was so great an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion
of the Churches right, what shall we think of that
Roman Catholick Clergy, who so Sacrilegiously invest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him with this <hi>Spiritual</hi> power? If that Synodical Act
was betraying the trust which the Clergy had receiv'd
from Christ, what shall we think of those Pastours, who
so unfaithfully manag'd the <hi>Depositum</hi> of their Saviour?
If denying the Popes Authority was so piacular a Crime,
what Opinion shall we entertain of those Religious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons

the Bill against it? What lastly of the <hi>Sovereign</hi> a declar'd
Enemy of the Lutheran Doctrine, and Defender of the
Roman Catholick Faith, who past that Bill into a Law,
and guarded the Sanction of it with Capital punishments?
If all these acted sincerely, then it is not the Doctrine of
the <hi>Reformed,</hi> but of the <hi>Romanists</hi> which is written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst:
If not, we seem to have just praejudices against a
Religion which had no greater influence over its Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors,
then to suffer a whole Nation of them perfidiously
to deny that, which if it be any part, is a main Article of
their Faith? But to return to our Author, what shall we
judge of his skill in Controversie who from Principles as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd
<hi>gratis,</hi> draws Deductions which by no means fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and which if they did follow, would be the greatest
Wound to that cause which he pretends to Patronize?
But because he has offer'd something under this first <hi>Thesis,</hi>
why the Prince should pay an implicit Obedience to his
Clergy, I come now to consider it. <q>He tells us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
that the Prince professeth Himself with the rest of
the Christians as to the knowing of Spiritual Truths
a Subject and Scholar of the Church; and he earnestly
claims a Supreme power and confesseth an Obligation
from God over all Persons in all <hi>Spiritual</hi> Matters to
bind them upon Temporal Punishments to Obedience
of the <hi>Churches</hi> (or <hi>Clergy's</hi>) Determinations and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees.</q>
But here he either willingly misrepresents, or
ignorantly mistakes our Principles; For the Prince
claims a supreme power over all persons, to bind them
by temporal Punishments to the Obedience not of the
<hi>Churches,</hi> but of <hi>Christs</hi> Laws; or of the <hi>former,</hi> no farther
then they are agreeable with the <hi>latter.</hi> But, saith He,
<q>
                  <pb n="45" facs="tcp:48656:25"/>
if the Prince meaneth here only where himself first
judgeth such their Decrees Orthodox and right, this
power is in effect claim'd to bind all persons in all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
matters only to his <hi>own</hi> Decrees; whilst he prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
an Obligation both of himself and His Subjects
to the <hi>Churches.</hi>
               </q> But, what if the Prince judge such
Decrees neither <hi>Orthodox</hi> nor <hi>right?</hi> Must he here give
them the Autority of Civil Sanctions? This is to establish
Iniquity by a Law; and a power is claim'd in effect to
bind all persons to the Decrees of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> whilst, as has
been said, He praetends an Obligation of Himself &amp; Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
to the Laws of <hi>Christ.</hi> But he goes on and tells us,
<q>That all Texts of the New-Testament do ordain Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Church-men to the <hi>Pagan</hi> Princes, that then
Reigned, no less then to <hi>others.</hi>
               </q> From which I suppose
he would infer an exemption from Obeying the Prince
in <hi>Spiritualibus.</hi> But supposing that all Texts do aequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ordain Obedience to Princes <hi>Pagan,</hi> and <hi>Christain,</hi> yet
the Obedience to a <hi>Christian</hi> Prince will be of greater la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
since because he professes the true Religion, his
Commands in <hi>Spirituals</hi> not contradicting our Saviours
will exact our Compliance. Obedience in <hi>licitis</hi> is all the
Subject ow's to a Prince either <hi>Christian</hi> or <hi>Infidel;</hi> but
the <hi>Christian</hi> Prince will oftner challenge my Obedience,
because he more rarely transgresseth the bounds of <hi>licita.</hi>
If as he adds, <q>all Princes are oblig'd with the Sword
which God hath given them to protect and defend his
<hi>true</hi> Religion, and Service in their Dominions, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
it offers it self to them;</q> Since many Religions
<hi>offer</hi> themselves, it becomes the Prince to take Care
which is the <hi>true;</hi> and not to take, whatever is offer'd;
which would be utterly destructive of our Authors Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
As for the <hi>Acts of Ancient Councils obliging even
without the Emperours consent,</hi> We own their Obligation
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48656:26"/>
over their proper Subjects, so far as they were agreeable
with the Laws of Christ, and his Apostles; and urge the
Autority of Emperours no farther then as adding their
<hi>Civil</hi> power to the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Power of the Church. And
here we challenge no other Power to our Princes, then
was exercis'd by Christian Emperours, that is, to call
Synods, and to have a liberty of confirming, or not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
their Decrees by <hi>Civil</hi> Sanctions. As for what
he cites out of our Writers, all amounts to no more then
this, that there are some Offices peculiar to the Church;
Which neither do we deny, nor did our Princes ever
invade these Functions. But because from hence He
would insinuate that the Prince has no power at all in
Causes <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> &amp; in his Citations from these Writers
comes up to that Character which the<note n="*" place="bottom">Book of Educ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>His next Author is Mr. <hi>Thorndike,</hi> Who is as large
as any one in the Vindication of the <hi>Churches</hi> rights;
and Yet He tells us<note n="q" place="bottom">Epilog. pag. 391.</note>, that No man will refuse Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Princes the Interest of protecting the Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
all such Acts as may prove praejudicial to the
common Faith. He holds (as this Writer with great
concern<note n="r" place="bottom">Church Government, pag. 390.</note> observes) that the Secular power may restore
any law, which Christ or his Apostles have ordained,
not only against a <hi>Major</hi> part, but all the Clergy and
Governours of the Church; and may, for a Paenalty of
their opposing it, suppress their power and commit it
to others, tho' they also be establish'd by another Law
Apostolical. Thus <hi>that considerative man, who held not
the Pope to be Antichrist, or the Hierarchy of the Church
to be followers of Antichrist</hi>

lays down these Rules,<note n="t" place="bottom">Ductor Dub. 1. 3. c. 3. r. 4.</note> That the Supreme Civil-power

praetends to have been conversant in his Writings, dares
appear in the Vindication of a Cause, which the Learned

will tell<note n="c" place="bottom">Bp. Br. Works Tom. 1. p. 88.</note> him, <q>That to affirm that Sovereign Princes
cannot make Ecclesiastical Constitutions under a Civil

<q>this Bishop doth not mean here that the Bishops
may both compose and execute Canons in the King's
Dominions, and use Ecclesiastical Censures by their
own Autority? But see, saith He, the Bishops depriv'd
of the former power in the Reformation.</q> To which
I answer that the power of which they were depriv'd
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48656:28"/>
in the Reformation was only of <hi>such</hi> an executing the
Canons as carried with it <hi>pecuniary</hi> and <hi>corporal</hi> Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
and this power the Bishop has told him they
could not Exercise by their own Autority. And here
it were to be wish'd that our Author in reading this Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's

and the <hi>Churches</hi> good; as in the Dispensation of

thought himself oblig'd to preserve the Episcopal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment

He was no Friend of implicit Obedience, but after he has

            <p>These are the Sentiments of our Authors, in which if
I have been over-long, the Reader will excuse me, that
I choose rather to intermix something useful from these
<hi>great</hi> Pens, then to entertain him altogether with the
Paralogisms and prevarications of this Writer. There is
nothing that remains considerable under this first <hi>Thesis,</hi>
but his <hi>Sub-sumption,</hi> 
               <q>that whatever powers belong'd
to the Church in times of persecution, and before Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours
had embrac'd Christianity, <hi>are,</hi> and <hi>must</hi> still be
allowed to belong to her in Christian States.</q> Which
I conceive not altogether so Necessary that it <hi>must</hi> be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed,
and I am sure by our Authors it <hi>is</hi> not. As for
Convening of Councils (the power of greatest concern)

               <hi>Andrews</hi> to this Quaestion (<q>What say you to
the 300 Years before <hi>Constantine?</hi> How went Assemblies
then? Who call'd them all that while?) returns this
Answer. Truly as the people of the Jews did before
in <hi>AEgypt</hi> under the tyranny of <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> They were
then a Church under persecution, until <hi>Moses</hi> was
rais'd up by God a Lawful Magistrate over them. The
cases are alike for all the world. No Magistrate did
assemble them in <hi>AEgypt,</hi> and good reason why; they
had none to do it. But this was no barr, but when
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48656:29"/>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> arose, authoriz'd by God, &amp; had the Trumpets by

            </p>
            <p>His Third <hi>Thesis</hi> is, <hi>That the Secular Prince cannot</hi>
               <note n="b" place="bottom">Soave Hist. of Conc. Tr. pag. 77.</note> 
               <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
or eject from the exercise of their office in his Dominions
any of the Clergy, nor introduce others into the place of the
ejected.</hi> But the Quaestion here is not, Whether the
Prince can <hi>eject</hi> any of the Clergy from the <hi>Exercise of
their Office,</hi> but, Whether he can depose any for <hi>not Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising</hi>
it? While the Clergy faithfully discharge their
Office, the Prince ought to protect them; and if for this
they suffer, no doubt but they are Martyrs. But it is
possible they may <hi>abuse</hi> their power, and then it is to
be enquir'd, Whether Civil Laws may not inhibit them
the <hi>Use</hi> of it? This Author holds the Negative, and
tell us <hi>1st.</hi> They cannot eject them at pleasure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
giving any cause thereof. But he doth not pretend
that the Reforming Princes ever ejected any without a
Cause given. And therefore he adds <hi>2ly,</hi> Neither may
Princes depose them for any Cause which concerns things
<hi>Spiritual;</hi> but with this Limitation, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Clergy. I could wish he had here told us
what he ment by things <hi>Spiritual.</hi> For things, as well
as Persons Spiritual are of great Extent. (<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Pope <hi>Paul</hi>
the <hi>3d</hi> told the Duke of Mantua, that it is the Opinion
of the Doctors, that Priest's Concubines are of Ecclsiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Jurisdiction.) But he gives us his reason for his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion
<q>Because it is necessary that a Judge to be a
competent one have as well <hi>potestatem</hi> in <hi>causam,</hi> as in
<hi>Personam,</hi> and the Prince as has been mention'd in the
<hi>1st Thesis</hi> has no Autority to judge such Causes purely
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48656:29"/>
Spiritual.</q> Now the power denied to the Prince in
the <hi>Ist Thesis</hi> is to determine matters of Faith. But may
not the Prince judge whether an Ecclesiastick deserves
Deprivation without determining a Matter of Faith?
May not he judge according to what has been already
determin'd by the Church? Or may not he appoint such
Delegates as can determine matters of Faith? Or are all
the Causes, for which a Clergy-man may be depriv'd,
merely Spiritual? By Virtue of this <hi>Thesis</hi> he proves
the Ejection of the <hi>Western Patriarch</hi> unlawful.<note place="margin">pag. 37.</note> Now
was not this Matter of Faith already determin'd by
the Clergy? Had they not unanimously decreed, That
he had no more Autority here, then any other forreign
Bishop? And can the King be said here to have acted
<hi>without the consent of the Clergy?</hi> And yet that matter of
fact is applied to this <hi>Thesis.</hi> As for the Ejection of the
Bishops in King <hi>Edward's</hi> time; is not that confest to
have been <hi>for not acknowledging the Regal Supremacy?</hi>
               <note place="margin">pag. 70.</note>
But this was a matter which wanted no new Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
for the <hi>Church-Autority</hi> had decided it in their
Synod in King <hi>Henry's</hi> Reign. But it is said, <q>the Judges
were not Canonical, as being the King's Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
part <hi>Clergy,</hi> part <hi>Laity.</hi>
               </q> But neither was the
cause purely Canonical; for denying the Supremacy
was not only an infringment of the Canon, but also a
Violation of an Act of Parliament. As for the Bishops,
<hi>Bonner</hi> and <hi>Gardiner,</hi> they were accus'd for not assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Civil <hi>power</hi> of the King in his Nonage. Nor
do they plead Conscience for not doing it, but deny the
Matter of Fact<note n="*" place="bottom">Burn. His. Ref. part. 2. I. 1. p. 127. 165.</note> The same Objections were then made
against their Deprivation, as are reassum'd by this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
now; and therefore it may suffice to return the
same answers. <q>That the Sentence being only of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48656:30"/>
privation from their Sees, it was not so entirely of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Censure, but was of a mix'd nature, so that
Lay-men might joyn in it; &amp; since they had taken Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions
from the King for their Bishopricks, by which
they held them only during the Kings pleasure, they
could not complain of their Deprivation, which was
done by the King's Autority. Others who look'd farther
back, remembred that <hi>Constantine</hi> the Emp. had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Secular</hi> Men to enquire into some things objected
to Bishops, who were call'd <hi>Cognitores,</hi> or <hi>Triers;</hi> and
such had examin'd the business of <hi>Coecilian</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Carthage,</hi> even upon an Appeal, after it had been tried
by several Synods; and given Judgment against <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
and his party. The same <hi>Constantine</hi> had also by
his Autority put <hi>Eustathius</hi> out of <hi>Antioch, Athanasius</hi>
out of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> out of <hi>Constantinople;</hi> and
though the Orthodox Bishops complain'd of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
as done unjustly at the false suggestion of the
<hi>Arrians,</hi> yet they did not deny the Autority of the
Emperors in such cases.</q>
               <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 127.</note> But neither is the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of Canterbury by this Author allow'd to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Judge; &amp; that, <hi>because He did not Act by his Canonical
Superiority in the Church, but by the Autority he joyntly with
the rest receiv'd from the King;</hi> As if he had ever the less the
power of a Metropolitan, because He was also the
King's Commissioner. By this way of arguing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
of Oecumenical Councils will be invalid, because
they were call'd to determine Controversies by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Emperors. But how Uncanonical soever King
<hi>Edward's</hi> Bishops are said to have been, He does not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
against Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> Bishops, tho' they in depriving
the Reformed, acted by Commission from the Queen. As
for the Bishops ejected in Q. <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> time, it has been
already said it was for a Civil cause, <hi>i. e.</hi> refusing the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48656:30"/>
Oath of Supremacy; which why it should be lawful in
her Father's time, and unlawful in her's; why it should
be contriv'd by Roman Catholics in <hi>that</hi> Reign, and
scrupled by the same Roman Catholics in <hi>this;</hi> Why it
should be inoffensive, when exprest in larger terms, and
scandalous, when mitigated; whence on a sudden the
Refusers espied so much Obliquity in that Oath, which
they had all took before probably either as Bishops or
Priests in the reigns of King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>8th,</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi>
the <hi>6th;</hi> whence this change of things proceeded, unless
from secret intimations from Rome, or their own Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy,
will not easily be conjectur'd. As for his <hi>Note,
that what is sayd of the other Clergy, may be said likewise of the
Patriarch, for any Autority which he stands posses'd of by such
Ecclesiastical Canons, as cannot justly be pretended to do any
wrong to the Civil Government.</hi> He has been often told by
our Authors, that <hi>Patriarchs</hi> are an Humane Institution;
That as they were erected, so they may be dissolv'd by
the Prudence of Men; that as they were erected by leave
and confirmation of Princes, so they may be dissolv'd by
the same; that the Bishop of Romes Patriarchate doth
not extend beyond the sub-urbicary Churches; that
we are without the reach of his Jurisdiction, and
therefore that the power claim'd over us is an Invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
that did not Popes think fit to dispence with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
for Perjury, having sworn to keep inviolably

Canons pretend to any Jurisdiction over us; That
they so invading ought to be judg'd by a free Oecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menical
Synod if such an one could be had; but that
this Remedy being praecluded us, Each National Church
has liberty to free her self from such Usurpation; that

might remove the Patriarchate from <hi>Rome</hi> to

            </p>
            <p>So much for the first branch of this <hi>Thesis;</hi> the <hi>2d</hi> is,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48656:31"/>
that <hi>as the Prince cannot eject, or depose the Clergy, so neither
can be introduce any into the place of those, who are ejected, or
deceas'd without the concurrence of the Clergy.</hi> If by the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence</hi>
of the Clergy, he means that the Person assign'd
by the Prince to any sacred office cannot execute it till he
be <hi>ordain'd</hi> by the Clergy, No one will deny it; Or if he
think that the Ordainer ought to lay hands on none but
whom he esteems fit for the discharge of so sacred an
Office; here also we agree with him; But how doth
it follow that because Ordination, which is consecrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men to the work of the Holy Ministry, is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Office of the Clergy, the Prince may not recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to the Church a fit Person so to be consecrated, or
assign to the Person already consecrated, the place where
he shall perform that Holy Work? As for the Canons
by him alledg'd, they being Humane Institutions are
not of AEternal Obligation, but changeable according
to the different State of the Church. If the <hi>31st</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick
Canon, which excommunicates all who gain Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices
by the Interest of Secular Princes, and forbids
the People to communicate with them, still oblige; then
we are exempted from Communion with the Bishop of
Rome. How comes the latter part of the <hi>6th</hi> Canon
of the Nicene Council which concerns the Election of
Bishops still to be valid, and the former part, which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
the Jurisdiction of Patriarchs, so long since to be null?

yet why must that be indispensable, when another Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,

has so little Autority? It is plain the manners of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
have varied much in the divers States of the Church.

were this right of placing and displacing left to a
<hi>Patriarch</hi> or a Synod, yet either of these might so manage
their trust that a corrupted majority of Clergy might state
divine matters according to their own minds, and so the
Doctrines of Christ be chang'd for the Traditions of men.
But to these objected Injuries which the Church may suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
from a bad Prince, we ought to oppose the benefit she
receives from the Protection of a good one; Nor is it more
true that <hi>Constantius an Arrian, by his unjustly displacing the
Orthodox Bishops, procur'd Arrianism to be voted in several
Eastern Synods,</hi> then that the succeeding Emperors by
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48656:32"/>
justly displacing the Arrian Bishops procur'd the Nicene
Faith to be receiv'd in succeeding Synods. But for these
mischiefs, which a National Synod is liable to, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
has found out, as he thinks, a Remedy in his</p>
            <p>Fourth Thesis, <hi>That a Provincial, or National Synod may
not lawfully make any difinitions in matters of Faith, or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
some Error, or Heresy, or other abuse in God's Service
contrary to the Decrees of former Superior Synods, or contrary to
the judgment of the Church Vniversal of the present Age Shew'd
in her publick Liturgies.</hi> But there is a <hi>Thesis</hi> in our Bibles,
which seems to me the very contradictory of this. For
saith the Prophet expresly,<note n="*" place="bottom">Hos. 4. 15.</note> 
               <hi>Though Israel transgress, yet
let not Iudah Sin.</hi> Tho' ten tribes continue corrupted in
their Faith, yet let the remaining Tribe take care to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
her self. For that <hi>Iudah</hi> had sinned, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
was here commanded to <hi>reform</hi> is plain from the words
of Scripture, where it is said, that<note n="*" place="bottom">2 King. c. 17. v. 9.</note> 
               <hi>Iudah kept not the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
of the Lord her God, but walk'd in the Statutes of
Israel which they made.</hi> But this argument of <hi>National</hi>
Councils reforming without the leave of <hi>General</hi> has been
manag'd with so great Learning and Demonstration by
Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> in his Discourse with <hi>Fisher,</hi> and his
Lordship's Arguments so clearly vindicated by the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
D. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> that as it is great Praesumption in this
Author to offer any thing in a cause which has had the
Honour to have suffer'd under those Pens, so neither would
it be modest in me to meddle any farther in a Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
by them exhausted. I shall therefore proceed to his</p>
            <p>Fifth Thesis, <hi>That could a National Synod make such Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions,
yet that a Synod wanting part of the National Clergy
unjustly depos'd, or restrained; and consisting partly of persons
unjustly introduc'd, partly of those who have been first threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
with Fines, Imprisonment, and deprivation, in case of their
Non-conformity to the Princes Injunctions in matters purely
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48656:33"/>
Spiritual, is not to be accounted a lawful National Synod,
nor the Acts thereof free and valid; especially as to their
establishing such Regal Injunctions.</hi> Now how this is
pertinent to our case I can by no means conjecture.
For it has been shew'd that neither were the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reforming
Bps. unjustly depos'd, nor the Reformers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly
introduc'd. But what he means by the Clergy's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
threatned with <hi>fines, imprisonment,</hi> and Deprivation in
case of their Non-conformity to the Prince's Injunctions
may be learnt from another passage in his Discourse,
where he tells us that the Clergy being condemn'd in the
Kings Bench in a <hi>Praemunire</hi> for acknowledging the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal's
power Legantine, and so become liable at the King's
pleasure to the <hi>Imprisonment</hi> of their Persons, and <hi>Confisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of their Estates,<note place="margin">pag 26.</note> did to release themselves of this <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire,</hi>
give the King the title of <hi>Ecclesiae &amp; Cleri Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cani
Protector, &amp; Supremum caput.</hi> Which Act, saith he,
so passed by them, that, as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> acknowledges, It is
easie to believe that Nothing but the apprehensions of
dangers, which hung over them by a Praemunire incurred
by them could probably have inclined them to it. But
here we have great reason to complain of the unpardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
praevarication of this Author in so foully misreprae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi> Which that it may be the more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous,
and that the Reader may make from this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
a true judgment of this Writer's sincerity, it will
be necessary to transcribe the whole passage as it lies in
the Doctor.<note n="*" place="bottom">Sch c 7. §. 5.</note> 
               <q>Though the first act of the Clergy in this
was so introduc'd, that it is easie to believe that nothing
but the apprehension of dangers which hung over them
(by a Praemunire incurr'd by them) could probably have
inclin'd them to it, and therefore I shall not pretend
that it was perfectly an Act of their first will and choice,
but that which the Necessity of affairs recommended
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48656:33"/>
to them, Yet the matter of right being upon that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
taken into their most serious debate in a Synodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
way, and at last a fit and commodious expression uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly
pitch'd upon by joynt consent of both Houses of
Convocation, there is no reason to doubt, but that they
did believe what they did profess, their fear being the
Occasion of their Debates, but the Reasons and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
observ'd in debate, the causes, as in all Charity
we are to judge, of their Decision.</q> Thus the Doctor.
Now this Prevarication is the more culpable, because it
is not an Original, but copied from Mr. <hi>Sergeant,</hi> whom
this Writer cannot but be praesumed to have known to
have falsified it. For Bishop <hi>Bramhal</hi> (in whose writings
we find him very conversant) had detected this mis-quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
in Mr. <hi>Sergeant,</hi> and severely Reprimands him for
it. His words are so applicable to our Author, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
excuse my self the Omission of them.<note n="*" place="bottom">Bp. Br. Wor. Tom. 1. p. 360.</note> 
               <q>He citeth half
a passage out of Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> but he doth Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>
notorious wrong. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> speaketh only of the
first Preparatory Act which occasion'd them to take the
matter of right into a serious debate in a Synodical way;
he applieth it to the subsequent Act of renunciation af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

of the Law, the Law of <hi>Praemunire,</hi> an Ancient Law

of England to preserve it from the Usurpations
of the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> but Mr. <hi>Sergeant</hi> mis-applieth it
wholly to the fear of the King's violent cruelty. Lastly,
he smothers Dr. <hi>Hammond's</hi> sense express'd clearly by
himself, that <hi>there is no reason to doubt, but that they did
believe what they did profess, the fear being the Occasion
of their debates, but the reasons or Arguments offer'd in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
the causes (as in all charity we are to judge) of their
Decision.</hi>

This Author must be thought to have read
these passages, and yet ventured the scandal of promoting
this Forgery, tho' without the Honor of being the first In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor
of it. Such practises, as these, require little <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versiall
skill,</hi> but much <hi>fore-head;</hi> and we have seen a
Machine lately publickly expos'd for this laudable Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

then ecchoing it forth again without blushing. Whether
this be not our Author's Talent, let the Reader judg; as also

he, <hi>I may have related some things partially, or omitted some
things considerable in this Matter.</hi> As for this Objection of

unluckily cited a passage from the (then) Lady <hi>Mary,</hi>

               <q>I am well assur'd (saith

that the King his Father's Laws were consented to <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

<hi>Temporal.</hi>
               </q> I shall say nothing more to this <hi>Thesis</hi> but op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
another to it, <hi>That could an Oecumenical Synod make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions
contrary to the word of God, yet that a Synod wanting
the greatest part of Christian Bishops, unjustly excluded, and
consisting partly of Persons unjustly introduc'd, partly of those
who have been first bribed with Mony, and promises of Church
praeferment, or praeengag'd by Oaths to comply with the Vsurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of a praetended Spiritual Monarch, is not to be accounted
a lawful Oecumenical Synod, nor the Acts thereof free and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid,
especially as to their establishing such usurpations.</hi> This is
a <hi>Thesis,</hi> which needs no Application. I proceed to his</p>
            <p>Sixth <hi>Thesis. That the Iudgment and consent of some Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of a Province, when they are the lesser part, cannot be call'd
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48656:34"/>
the judgment and consent of the Whole Clergy of the Province.</hi>
This Assertion, that a lesser part is not aequall to the Whole,
is the only thing which looks like Mathematics in the
whole Discourse; and the Reader may hence be convinc'd
that our Author doth sometimes travel in the<note n="*" place="bottom">Educ. p. 119.</note> 
               <hi>High
road of Demonstration.</hi> But here we desire it may be
prov'd, either that the Reformation was not effected by
the <hi>major</hi> part of the Clergy, or that a <hi>minor</hi> part judging
<hi>according</hi> to truth are not to be obey'd rather then the
<hi>Major</hi> part judging <hi>contrary</hi> to it. In the mean time it is
easily reply'd, that the judgment and consent of some few
Bishops (<note n="*" place="bottom">Soave Hist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Conc. Tr. p. 153.</note> suppose 48. Bishops, and 5. Cardinals giving
Canonical Autority to books Apocryphal, and making
Authentical a translation differing from the Original)
cannot be esteem'd the judgment and consent of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic
Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>7th.</hi> Thesis. <hi>That since a National Synod may not define
matters of Faith contrary to former Superior Councils, much
less may any Secular Person define contrary to those Councils,
or also to a National Synod.</hi> The defining matters of Faith
we allow to be the proper office of the Clergy; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
every one must give an account of his own Faith,
every one is oblig'd to take care that what he submits to
the belief of, be consistent with his Christianity: I am
oblig'd to pay all submission to the Church-Autority, but
the Church having bounds, within which she ought to be
restrain'd in her Determinations, if she transgresses these
Limits, and acts against that Christianity, which she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses
to maintain, I may rather refuse obedience, then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seit
my Christianity. If in a cause of this moment I make
a wrong Judgment, I am answerable for it at Gods Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
not because I usurped a right, which was never gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
me, but because I misus'd a Liberty which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg'd
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48656:35"/>
me. This we take to be the case of each private
Christian; and farther, that the Prince having an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
not only to believe a-right, and Worship God (as is
praescrib'd) himself, but also to protect the true Faith and
Worship in his Dominions, ought to use all those means
of discovering the Truth, which God has afforded, <hi>viz.</hi>
consulting the Pastours of the Church, reading the word
of God <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that, having discover'd it, He may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgate
it to His Subjects by them also to be embrac'd,
but not without the use of that Judgment and Discretion
which to them also is allowed. If here it happens that
the Civil and Ecclesiastical power command things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
there is nothing to be done by the Subject but to
enquire on which side God is; and if God be on the King's
side by a direct Law in the matter, He is not on the
Churches side for her Spiritual Autority. Thus a good
King of Israel might<note n="*" place="bottom">2 King. 38. 22.</note> 
               <hi>take away the High places and Altars,
and say unto Iudah and Ierusalem, Ye shall Worship before the
Altar at Ierusalem,</hi> because such a Command was justifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
by the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> Nor is it any Praejudice against
it,<note n="*" place="bottom">2 King. 23. 9.</note> 
               <hi>That the Priests of the High places refus'd to come up to

            <p>I should now proceed to examine the <hi>Historical</hi> part
of his Discourse; but <hi>that</hi> I understand is already under
the Consideration of another Hand, from which the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
may shortly expect a satisfactory account. But I
may not omit for the Reader's diversion a Grammatical
Criticism which our Author hath made upon the little
particle <hi>as.</hi> It is enacted the <hi>32d. Hen. 8. 26. c.</hi>

upon the matters of Christ's Religion <hi>&amp;c.</hi> shall be by
all his Grace's Subjects fully Believ'd, Obey'd, &amp;c. <hi>Vpon
which he makes this learned Note.</hi> Whereas under the
Reformation private Men are tied only to obey and
believe the Definitions of Councils when they are set
forth according to God's word. <hi>i. e.</hi> when private Men
think them to be so, yet here this Liberty was thought
fit to be restrain'd, and private men tyed to believe these
Definitions when set forth <hi>as</hi> according to God's word.
<hi>i. e.</hi> when the setters forth believe them to be so. To
obey a thing defin'd according to God's word; and
to obey a thing defin'd, <hi>as</hi> being according to God's
word, are Injunctions very different.</q> Now a little skill
in <hi>Honest Walker's</hi> particles would have clear'd this
point, and a School-boy that was to turn this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage

Controversie at an Age when they have forgot their
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48656:36"/>
Grammar. Notwithstanding therefore this <hi>Aristarchus,</hi>
We still retain the Liberty of believing and obeying on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
such things, which be defined according to God's Word.
For which we are much blamed in the Conclusion of this
Discourse.</p>

Consciences do not witness to us any disobedience to the
Church-Catholic, but only to that Church which falsly
praetends to be Catholic. He means <hi>to the Major part of the
Guides thereof.</hi> But the cause has not yet been decided by
Poll, that we should know which side has the Majority.
<hi>Let him know that his Condition is very dangerous, when he

There was a time then, when to believe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiality
of the Son was a dangerous Condition; and
this perhaps made Pope <hi>Liberius externally</hi> to profess Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianism.
<hi>When for the maintaining of his Opinions he begins
to distinguish and divide between the doctrine of the Scripture,
and the Doctrine of the Church.</hi> But why not distinguish,
where the Church her self distinguishes, and saith, <hi>Christ
indeed in the Scriptures instituted so, but I institute o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise;</hi>
as in the case of denying the Cup. <hi>Between the
Doctrines of the Catholic Church of the former ages, and of the

<hi>When they grant that God hath given them, beside the

sits, the Judges will consult the Scripture, the <hi>Statute</hi>
they are to go by, and if they judge according to that,
they will judge well.</p>
            <p>These are the Doctrines of blind-Obedience which this
Author so studiously inculcates. For since Doctrines are
taught us different from Scripture, we are advis'd to use
another way of discerning Doctrines, then what the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel
prescribes. Our Saviour bids us,<note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 16. 6. 12.</note> 
               <hi>Beware of the leaven.</hi>
