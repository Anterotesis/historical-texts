         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

togither, was this Sermon
preached by that worthy
Seruant of God, and our common frend,
now with God, then first (as I haue heard
him say) performing that office that then
he did. Which of late lighting vpon, among
other his loose papers, I thought it would
not be amisse rather to send it abroad, then
to suffer it (as it might soone perhaps other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise)

and pithines of the discourse it selfe seemed
to require no lesse of me: that which any

with me easily acknowledge. The rarity
likewise of the subiect the rather encited
me thereunto. He treadeth a tracke not so

not a few. Such as handle the religious ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging

many; I remember not to haue seene any.
It is that, that this holy Man of God doth
here principally insist vpon: and it is a
point very necessarie, and of no small vse.

                        <p>1. And the third day there was a Mariage in Cana of
Galile; and the Mother of Iesus was there.</p>
                        <p>2. And both Iesus was called and his Disciples to
the Mariage.</p>
                        <p>3. And when they wanted Wine, the Mother of Iesus
said vnto him; They haue no Wine.</p>
                        <p>4. Iesus said vnto her; Woman, what haue I to doe
with thee? mine houre is not yet come.</p>
                        <p>5. His Mother said vnto the Seruants; whatsoeuer
he saith vnto you, do it.</p>
                        <p>6. Now there were set there six water-pots of stone,
after the Iewish manner of Purification, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning
two or three firkins a-peece.</p>
                        <p>7 Iesus said vnto them; Fill the water-pots with
water. And they filled them vp to the brim.</p>
                        <p>8 And he said vnto them; Draw out now and beare
vnto the Gouernor of the Feast. And they bare it.</p>
                        <p>9 When the Ruler of the Feast had tasted the Water
that was made Wine, not knowing whence it

Because the Doctrine flowing from these
particulars, is not so pertinent to this present
Occasion.</p>
                  <p>But before that we descend into particulars, let
vs first in the generall obserue from the maine scope
and drift of this Storie, this instruction.</p>
                  <p>That the more that Sathan and his accursed
Imps,<note place="margin">The generall Doctrine.</note> shall labour to disgrace and discountenance
any sacred Ordinance of God; the more will God
grace and honour the same.</p>
                  <p>The truth of this appeares in no one thing more,
then in this matter of Mariage. It is wonderfull to
consider, how the Diuell hath euer laboured to
disgrace and put it out of countenance: How he
hath made the day of ones Mariage, as ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and reprochfull, as if it were the day of ones
publique penance or execution; what laughing and
scoffing, what flearing, jering, and nodding the head
is there, not onely of such as are yet single, but of
those that are themselues maried persons; not only
of profane swaggerers, and those of the damned
crue (as they are called) but of those (many times)
that haue the reputation of Ciuill honest men, yea
of Professors of Religion. In so much, as if those
that are to be knit togither in this sacred bond, were
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:3137:27"/>
to measure their estate by the mindes, words, and
ordinarie behauiours of the Spectators, yea many
times of those, who seeme to honor the Solemnitie
with their presence and attendance: It were better
for them to stand as long in a white sheet, or to be
carted thorow the streets, then to present themselues
into the Congregation to knit this holy and invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
knot. For in that case lightly you should haue
none but vnhappy boyes, and such persons as are
naught themselues, to make signes of disgrace; good
mindes vse to pitie them that are so publikely
(though deseruedly) disgraced. But here, for the
most part, all, good and bad, old and young, set
themselues, though not with their hands, yet with
their hearts, countenances, and words, to cast durt
and puddle water in the faces of those that are to
enter into this Calling, as if they were to enter into
a Calling most sinfull, and shamefull, and most odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and vile both in the eyes of God and man.</p>
                  <p>This is indeed a hellish and damnable iniquitie;
but behold yet a greater iniquitie then this: Sathan
hath so wouen his owne impuritie, with the pure
Ordinance of God, that a Mariage, is accounted no
Mariage, if it be not solemnized with beastly and
profane Songs, Sonnets, Ijggs, indited by some hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Spirit, and chaunted by those, that are the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
incendiaries of all filthy lusts; and these are
ordinarily made in the scorne and derision of this
Holy Estate, to delight and solace the Guests with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.
But indeed they tend to no other end, but to
despite and disgrace this worthy Ordinance of
God, and to make it seeme in the eyes of men,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:3137:27" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nothing else but a matter of obscenenesse and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse.
So that if God himselfe had not had a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
care, to vphold, to grace and countenance this
Estate, by how much more Sathan laboureth to
make it odious and vile, all the world long before
this, had bin a very Stewes and Brothel-house. See
then, the care that God hath to honour this ancient
Ordinance of his; how (notwithstanding that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than
hath euer done his vttermost to disgrace it, and
make it vile) God subjecteth the whole world vnto
it, not fooles onely, but wise, not poore, but the
richest, not profane persons onely, but the holiest
and the religiousest that euer were, not base persons,
but Kings and Emperors: So that not onely all
sorts and degrees of men, but in a manner euery
man and woman in the world, he bringeth vnder
this yoke; so that the whole world (to account of)
is as it were, but a maried person: And this is so
much the more to be wondred at, that the Diuell
can make that so shamefull, which is so common.
It is not so in sinnes, nor it would not be so in this, if
it were not a speciall diuine Ordinance.</p>
                  <p>This should incourage vs,<note place="margin">The Vse.</note> with all alacritie and
confident Spirits, to submit our selues to any of
Gods Ordinances, and with so much the greater
courage and heart, by how much the more contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible,
&amp; despised, they shall appeare to be amongst
men. For the more that men do despite Gods
Ordinances, the more will God honour the same,
and those that with honest hearts shall vndergo the
same. You may see <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. that the very first worke
that God did, after the very first creation of man
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:3137:28"/>
and woman, was his marying of man to woman:
and you see here, that one of the first Wonders
that Christ wrought was in honour of a Mariage.</p>
                  <p>We come now to the first point, wherein Christ
graceth and honoureth Mariage, and that is, by
vouchsafing his presence at the solemnization of it,
or at the Mariage Feast.</p>
                  <p>Wherein these two points are to be considered
in order.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The inviting of Christ vnto the Mariage.</item>
                     <item>2. His comming vnto it, being invited.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>From the first point let vs learne these Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in order.<note place="margin">Invitation.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the Mariage Feasts,<note place="margin">The 1. Doctr. in speciall.</note> and Solemnities of
Christians, ought so to be ordered, that nothing
ought to be done or committed therein, that may
not beseeme the presence of our Sauiour Christ.</p>
                  <p>Of this iudgement and affection were these Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
that at this time invited our Sauiour Christ, else
they would neuer haue invited him. For far be it
that we should thinke, (yea the Storie shewes the
contrary) that these Persons called Christ to this
Feast, to vex and greiue his Soule, with scurrile and
ribald merriments, and with wanton and vnchast
sports &amp; delights; or that for reuerence of Christs
presence, they excluded and laid aside any lawfull
delights fitting such an Exercise; and therefore,
though there was a solemne Feast at this Mariage,
and though out of question the day was spent in
delights and pleasures, (as is most meete for such
matters) yet they were such delights and pleasures,
as they durst call our Sauiour Christ vnto, yea and
make him a partaker of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:3137:28"/>
Fie therefore and a shame of such mirth as doth
not beseeme the presence of Christ,<note place="margin">The Vse.</note> of such words,
as beseeme not his eares, of such actions and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises
as beseeme not his holy eyes; such mirth and
pastime is not befitting any Solemnitie, much lesse
so honorable a Solemnitie, as Mariage is or ought to
be, which is a sacred knot, whereby two persons are
inviolably knit togither by the hand of God. As
therefore this day, many of you are called to feast
and rejoyce with these Parties, that are to be vnited
in a faithfull bond: So I beseech you, as you will
answer it before the Lord, and looke for a blessing
vpon these Parties, in loue of whom you are assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
that you would looke to your mirth, and see
whether it be such, as in your Consciences you are
perswaded, that Christ Iesus himselfe, if he were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
would not be offended, but well pleased with it.
Consider whether thy mirth and laughter be such, as
Christ Iesus would be delighted therein with thee:
For Christ our head, mourneth with those that
mourne in him, and rejoceth with those that rejoyce
in him: Otherwise assure thy selfe, that that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of thine, with which Christ Iesus is displeased,
shall be turned into paine; that that ioy of thine,
wherein Christ doth not ioy with thee, shall be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
into sorrow; that laughter of thine, that is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensiue
to him, shall be turned into teares. There
cannot be a greater wrong offred<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to a man, then for
any to make themselues merry with that, which shal
greiue and vex him: How much more is it an hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
wrong vnto God, when men shall be assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to solace &amp; delight themselues in those things,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:3137:29"/>
which doe anger and displease him. Especially at
such a time, when he should be moued to bestow
a blessing vpon the Parties married; and then, when
we begg all joy and comfort for them at the hand
of God. Verily, the monstrous profane abuses that
ordinarily vse to be vpon such Occasions, are no
doubt the speciall causes, of so many curses, that the
Lord layeth vpon many that enter into this honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
state, when the same shall in such vile manner
be profaned and abused by them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The 2. Doctr. in speciall.</note> the example of these virtuous persons
that were maried in <hi>Cana,</hi> and of them that made
this Feast, is to be imitated of all true Christians,
that haue giuen their names to Iesus Christ: they
must call Christ Iesus to their Wedding, they must
invite him to their Mariage Feast.</p>
                  <p>And great reason it is, that among others, nay
aboue all other Guests, Christ Iesus should be
one.</p>
                  <p>For 1.<note place="margin">1. Reason.</note> If you that are to be maried be Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Christ Iesus is the greatest frend that you haue
in the whole world, in heauen, or in earth: And
nature and custome hath taught men this, to call
their cheifest and best frends to their Weddings. So
that inviting others and passing by him, it shewes
that they make higher account of others then of
him, and that (at the least) he is none of their dearest
frends. And they are deadly enemies to Christ that
take not him to be their dearest frend.</p>
                  <p>2.<note place="margin">2. Reason.</note> As Christ is the dearest frend to euery true
Christian, so is he the neerest neighbour: Thou
needs not send far for him, he is deere alwayes, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:3137:29"/>
at hand to those that call vpon him: And it is the
vse euer to invite our neerest neighbours, if they be
our frends. Now the Diuell is his Inmate, who
hath not Christ for his neerest neighbour.</p>
                  <p>3.<note place="margin">3. Reason.</note> There is none hath more interest in the Bride
and Bridegroome, then Christ Iesus. He first gaue
them both to their Parents; He hath kept and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
them to this estate; He it is that hath giuen
them their health, wealth, strength, beauty, &amp; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
is worthy or louely in them: He could take
it away at his pleasure againe; yea he could in a
moment take the Bride from the Bride-Grome,
and on a sudden, and in the twinckling of an eye,
turne all this preparation of joy into heauinesse
and greife.</p>
                  <p>4.<note place="margin">4. Reason.</note> All Christians, are the Sonnes and Daughters
of God, and they are married in the house of God:
Their Parents vpon earth are but Gods deputies.
What a shame were it then to exclude Christ Iesus,
and not to invite him?</p>
                  <p>5.<note place="margin">5. Reason.</note> He sends all those things, wherewith thou
solemnizest thy feast: they are all his presents. And
wilt thou faile to invite him, that sendeth prouisions
in so franckly and liberally to thee?</p>
                  <p>6.<note place="margin">6. Reason.</note> Who is it but Christ Iesus, that can blesse
any Mariage, and make it comfortable and joyfull
to the Parties? Who but he can curse it, and make
it an yron yoke to both the parties? Therefore
great cause there is to invite him aboue all other.</p>
                  <p>But alas (it will be said) Christ is now in heauen,
and will not come, though he should be invited;
That for our parts wee would count our selues
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:3137:30"/>
happy, if he would vouchsafe to come to vs.</p>
                  <p>I answer, that though Christ Iesus be locally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in regard of his bodie, yet in regard of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
he is present: and if mens hearts were set vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him, as they ought to be; if they did but desire
his presence, they should finde his presence, euen
in as comfortable a manner, as if he should descend
from the Right Hand of his Father, and in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
goe with the Bridegrome and Bride to Church,
and sit downe at the table with them.</p>
                  <p>You therefore that are interessed in this present
Action,<note place="margin">The Vse.</note> where so many Guests are invited, examine
your owne Soules and Consciences, whether you
haue not forgotten the principall Guest: It were
better that the day of thy Mariage had bin the day
of thy Buriall, then that it should be said, Thou
wast married, and Christ Iesus not remembred:
And therefore if your Consciences smite you in
this, see that before you goe out of this place you
invite him: It is not too late; thou art now in his
presence, lift vp thy heart and minde, and desire
him, that he would be present, and that thou maist
haue his blessed companie; and then you shall be
sure of a blessed and joyfull issue.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Doctr. 3.</note> Christians that would haue Christ Iesus
present, at their Feasts and Mariage-Solemnities,
may learne hence, what persons they are to invite
to keep Christ company. For in the Text it is
specified of this Wedding, that the Mother of
Christ was there, and the Disciples of Christ; all
godly persons, all speciall frends vnto Christ. We
say in the Prouerbe, <hi>Its merry when frends meet;</hi>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:3137:30"/>
And we know by experience, that if men invite
their speciall frend, they will haue a care what
company they entertaine him withall. If it may
be, they will take order that some that they
know he loueth shall be invited to keepe him
company, at least such as they thinke he doth not
hate. Neither can a man doe his frend a greater
wrong, then to invite him to feasting and merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when togither with him, he inviteth such as
will by all possible meanes disgrace &amp; despite him.</p>
                  <p>Beloued,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> Christ Iesus is the dearest frend thou
hast in the world, what interest he hath to be a bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Guest, to all Christian Mariages, I haue shewed
before. There's none but will say, they haue called
Christ Iesus to their Mariage, and do desire aboue
all things, that he would bestow a blessing vpon
them; you come to the Church in this solemne
manner, to that very end and purpose to call him:
But how doe Christians vse Christ Iesus at such
times? Certainly men vsually prouide Christ such
companions, as if they should rake hell for them.
Such as set themselues, by blasphemie, ribaldrie, and
all kinde of profanesse, to despite Christ Iesus, and
to offer all indignities possible to Him and his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
Is it therefore any wonder, that Christ his
own ordinance to some should proue a curse; when
he himself, in the solemnization thereof, shall be in
such a manner cursed and blasphemed, and when
men at such times in steed of inviting the Mother
of Christ and his Disciples, to keepe Christ com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie,
shall bid <hi>Annas,</hi> and <hi>Caiphas,</hi> and <hi>Malchus,</hi>
and other such like mates, whom they know will
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:3137:31"/>
set themselues to disgrace and scorne Iesus by all
possible meanes.</p>
                  <p>In the second place it is to bee considered,<note place="margin">Christs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</note>
that Christ commeth to the Mariage Feast being
called.</p>
                  <p>Whence in order, let vs obserue these Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">1. Doctr.</note> the wonderfull meeknesse and lowlinesse of
Iesus Christ; that being called, would vouchsafe
his presence, to countenance and grace the mariage
of these two Persons, who as it seemes were but
some poore couple, else they would in all likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
haue forecast to haue had wine enough. It
would be thought a folly worthy to be chronicled,
if a Swineheard or a Shepheard, should presume to
invite the King, and his Councell, to his wedding.
All the Kingdome would be in a wonderment, if
being so invited, they should come and grace his
Mariage with their Presence and with Gifts. Is it
not much more to be wondred at, that the King of
Glory, the Eternall Sonne of God should descend
so low, to grace with his high and holy presence, so
base and lowly a Couple.</p>
                  <p>As Christ was,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> so ought much more all his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
to be: Kings and Princes may and ought in
such Cases to keep State; but it must not be so with
the Ministers of Christ; They must be as Christ
and his Apostles were,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 22.</note> 
                     <hi>All vnto all, that they may
gaine some.</hi> Though they ought to rebuke Kings
and Emperors when they are called vnto it, yet
they ought also to subiect themselues to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and lowest of Gods people, and should not
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:3137:31"/>
thinke much to goe to the meetings of the meanest,
if a Christian Soule should desire it.</p>
                  <p>Obserue secondly,<note place="margin">2. Doctr.</note> what a wonderfull grace and
countenance herein Christ sheweth to this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
Verily, if he had done no more, but this,
to sit downe at the Table with them, to eat of their
meats, and to drinke of their cups, it had bin a far
greater honour, then if he had sent a Companie of
Angels from heauen visibly to haue waited vpon
and serued the Bridegroome and Bride, that same
day. If the Antichristian Papist had but such a
president, to grace their impure Votaries, their
Monks, and their Nunns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if Christ had but gone
in that manner, being invited, to a Monasterie, a
Priorie, a Nunnery, or a Hermitage, it had bin
enough to haue cried downe Mariage for euer, and
to haue aduanced their loose single life infinitely
aboue it.</p>
                  <p>This should teach vs to make the same vse of it
for the magnifying of Mariage,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> which they would
haue made of it, if they had it for their counterfeit
Virginitie; though its most probable, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
would not haue shewed themselues so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for it, if they should haue perceiued that
Christ had bin such a frend vnto it.</p>
                  <p>Note thirdly from hence,<note place="margin">3. Doctr.</note> that Christ Iesus is no
enemie to honest mirth &amp; delight, at such meetings
and solemnities as this, but hath by his owne pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
and precedent approued it. Though we doe
not read in the Scripture, that Christ euer laughed,
yet we neede not thinke that he was so rigide and
austere, that he could indure no mirth and delight;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:3137:32"/>
As though men in his Presence were in their silent
dumps, and made dumbe shewes onely one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
Surely then would not Christ haue bin so
often invited to Feasts as he was; or if he had, he
would not haue frequented them so often: For the
speciall vse of Feasts are for frends to rejoyce and
make merry togither in; and therefore in the Holy
Tongue haue their<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> Chaggim.</note> name, from leaping and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing.</p>
                  <p>So that we see hence,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> That there is a season and a
time when Christians may rejoyce togither, yea and
that in the presence and before the face of Christ
Iesus himselfe; he sitting by, and looking on. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants
vse to be most merry amongst themselues,
and the presence of Master and Mistris damps their
mirth. But the Seruants of Christ may be as merry
in his presence as behinde his backe. Yea they are
more merry when he sits at table with them, then
when he is absent.</p>
                  <p>I obserue this the rather, to crosse an illusion of
Sathan, whereby he vsually perswades the merry
Greekes of the world; That if they should once
devote themselues to the Seruice of Iesus Christ,
that then they must bid an euerlasting farewell to all
mirth and delight; that then all their merry dayes
are gone; that in the kingdome of Christ, there is
nothing, but sighing and groning, and fasting and
prayer. But see here the contrary: euen in the
kingdome of Christ, and in his House, there is
marrying and giuing in mariage, drinking of wine,
feasting, and rejoycing euen in the very face of
Christ. Nay its not possible, that any person vpon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:3137:32"/>
earth, should joy as the seruants of Christ doe. Doe
but consider the joy of a condemned person, when
at the place of Execution he hath receiued a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:
Such is the joy of Christs seruants, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
then, when Christ comes vnto them. For before
he vses to come, he suffers men to be as persons at
the point of Execution, he brings them euen to the
pit of Hell, to Hell mouth, and then when he
comes to them, he brings a Pardon with him.
Christs seruants indeed haue many greifes, and
qualmes come ouer their heart; but it is then with
them, as with women neere their time of bringing
forth; they are in trauaile with some joy. Cleane
contrary it is with wicked ones; who haue oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
many flashings of joy: but when they are
in the height of it, they are then big-bellied, and
ready to trauell of some sorrow: and their owne
wofull experience makes them expect it. For its
very vsuall with them in the extremitie of their
mirth to say, <hi>I pray God I heare of no sorrow, I haue
bin this day so merry.</hi> And good cause they haue
so to feare, that cannot be merry, except the Diuell
play the Musitian; that cannot sing, except the
dittie be made in Hell. Let all our jolly Gallants
and merry Companions therefore know, That the
Children of God can be merry and pleasant, though
they cannot cog, lie, sweare, swagger, talke lasciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously,
and filthily, &amp;c. And they shall then be euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly
merry,<note place="margin">Esai. 65. 13, 14, 18, 19.</note> when the wicked that now seeme
to be made of nothing else but mirth and pleasure,
shall gnash their teeth and howle in Hell for euer
and euer.</p>

4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>.<note place="margin">4. Doctr.</note> Sith Christ is ready to come to our Mariages
and Weddings; This should teach vs, to prouide
for him, those dishes, that himselfe best loues, and
that he vseth most to feed vpon. In which prouision,
thou needst not to put euer the more in the Pot for
him, or vpon the Spit, or in the Ouen. But the Table
that thou art to spread to Christ must be in thy
heart; see that thy heart stand syncerely affected
vnto him; yea thou must dresse and prepare thy
Soule for him.<note place="margin">Ioh. 4. 32, 34.</note> For as the speciall meat that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for himselfe to feed vpon, was, his doing of

prepare for him, is, Thy obedience to his will.</p>
                  <p>Those therefore that call Christ to their lewdnes,<note place="margin">Vse.</note>
ribaldrie, blasphemie, &amp;c. they call him to a banket
of Carrian, or a worse matter then that; and offer
him a bowle of vineger and gall to drinke.</p>
                  <p>The second meanes,<note place="margin">Miracle.</note> by which Christ dignifieth
Mariage, is, by working a Miracle, yea the first Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
that euer he wrought, a Miracle whereby he
turnes water into wine, yea into most excellent
wine. I must in regard of Time, handle all these
points togither confusedly.</p>
                  <p>1.<note place="margin">1. Doctr.</note> Hence obserue that Christ being called to
the Mariage, cometh thither God as well as man;
yea and graceth the Mariage with the manifestation
of his Deity; so that those that haue this grace to
call Christ Iesus to their Mariage, (and all such call
him, as heartily call vpon him,) they shall feele his
presence, yea and his diuine power in his presence;
for Christ neuer comes being called, but he leaues
behinde him some prints of his Godhead &amp; divine
power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:3137:34"/>
And this may be a signe vnto thee;<note place="margin">Vse.</note> That thou
neuer didst heartily call Christ Iesus, vnto thy house,
and vnto thy table, if thou hast had no sense and
feeling of his diuine power, doing a greater worke
and more powerfull within thy selfe, then is the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of water into wine.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Doctr. 2.</note> Obserue how Christ recompenceth
those that are kind vnto him, how in their necessitie
he worketh a Miracle to supply their want. So that
they, that haue this grace, to invite Christ Iesus, and
to call him to their Feasts, rather then they shall
want any thing needfull for them, he will worke
Miracles.</p>
                  <p>What greater incouragement can men haue then
this, to make Christ Iesus alwayes their cheefest
Guest? For then, rather then they shall die for hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
or thirst, he will raine milke, and honie, and
Quailes from Heauen, to feede and nourish
them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Doctr. 3.</note> In that Christ vpon present necessitie
turnes Water into Wine, the present Feast requiring
it; It teacheth vs, That Christs extraordinarie works
are not for gazing and wonderment, but for speciall
vse, according to the seuerall necessities of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.
They wanted wine, the soule and life of a
Feast; and Christ by Miracle makes wine.</p>
                  <p>And first this againe,<note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> should be a wonderfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
especially to persons entring into
the state of Matrimonie, which seemeth to bring
many necessities with it, to make speciall account
of such a Guest, who will not onely supply their
wants in generall, but their speciall wants, belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:3137:35"/>
to their speciall places. He that but in a matter
of ceremonie and complement, turned water into
wine, that there might be no dishonor to that Feast,
where he was a Guest: Will he see any needfull
thing wanting to them that marry in his feare?</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> this should comfort men against the
ouer-much cares of this world, for Wife, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
He that now turned water into wine, can
turne stones into bread<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lead into siluer, brasse into
gold, &amp; will do it rather then thou shouldest want,
and if in his wisedome he did see it good for these
he can also as, easily turne a bad Husband into a
good, and a bad Wife into a good, a Poore man into
a Rich, a Base man into a Noble, a Cottage into a
Pallace &amp;c. Make much therefore of Christ. For
on the contrary side, exclude Christ out of your
Feasts, and he will turne thy wine into water, if not
