            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>Pſalm 2. 11. and 12 Verſes.</bibl>
               <q>Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoyce with trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. Kiſs the Son leaſt he be angry, and ye periſh from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little, bleſſed are all they that put their truſt in him.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THe chief ſcope of the Pſalm is, to foretel the Extent and prevalency of the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> admoniſhing his Enemies to ſubmit to his Government, deriding the vanity of their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing projects and fury, and forewarning them of their ruine if they come not in.</p>
            <p>I ſhall draw the ſcope of the Text into this one Doctrine. <hi>No power or priviledge can ſave that man from the fearful ſudden conſuming wrath of God, that doth not unfainedly love, depend upon, and ſubject himſelf unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In handling of this point, I ſhall obſerve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> order.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:151530:4"/>
Firſt I will ſhew you what this <hi>Love, Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,</hi> and <hi>Subjection are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, what wrath it is that will thus kindle and conſume them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, why this Kiſſing the Son is the only way to eſcape it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, why no power or priviledge elſe can procure their eſcape.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Application.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Subjection</hi> to Chriſt is, the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his abſolute Soveraignty both as he is God, Creatour, and as a Redeemer over all the world, and particularly our ſelves, and a hearty conſent to this his Soveraignty, eſpecially that he be our Lord, and his Laws our Rule, and a delivering our ſelves to be governed accordingly.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this <hi>Dependency</hi> on Chriſt is, when we acknowledge the ſufficiency of his ſatisfaction, and his power, and willingneſs to ſave all that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him in his free univerſal offer in the Goſpel, we do heartily accept him for our only Saviour, and accordingly <hi>[renouncing all other]</hi> do wait upon him beleivingly, for the benefits of his <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings</hi> and Office, and the performance of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3+ letters">
                  <desc>•••…</desc>
               </gap>hful covenant to us, in reſtoring us to all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3+ letters">
                  <desc>•••…</desc>
               </gap>ings which we loſt, and advancing us to a far <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ater everlaſting glory.</p>
            <p>Thirdly this <hi>Affection</hi> to <hi>Chriſt</hi> is, when in the
<pb facs="tcp:151530:4"/>
knowledge and ſence of his love to us both com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and eſpecial, and of his own excellency, and the bleſſedneſs of enjoying of him and the Father, and life by him; our hearts do chuſe him and the Father by him as our only happineſs, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly love him above all things in the world. Theſe threefold deſcriptions containeth the ſumm of the Goſpel, ſo hath it nothing but what is of neceſſity to ſound <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, what <hi>wrath</hi> is it that will thus kindle and conſume them; as there are two <hi>Covenants,</hi> ſo each hath his proper penalty for its breaking.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then, till men do come in and ſubmit to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they lye under the <hi>wrath</hi> of God for all their ſins, as they are againſt the <hi>Covenant</hi> of works, or they are lyable to the curſe of that <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. Chriſt</hi>'s death hath taken away the curſe of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> not abſolutely from any man, but conditionally, which becomes abſolute when the condition is performed: the Elect themſelves are not by nature under the <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace, but remain under the curſe of the firſt <hi>Covenant,</hi> till they come into <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Whoſoever rejecteth or neglecteth this Grace, and ſo finally breaketh the new <hi>Covenant,</hi> muſt alſo bear the curſe or the penalty thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all the former, which will be a greater curſe, even as the bleſſings of this <hi>Covenant</hi> are far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than thoſe of the firſt. It was a heavy puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb facs="tcp:151530:5"/>
to be caſt out of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> from the preſence of God, and to be curſed by him and ſubject to <hi>Eternal death,</hi> and all creatures below curſed for our ſakes, to bear all thoſe <hi>curſes</hi> and <hi>Plagues</hi> threatned in <hi>Duteronomy</hi> 27. ch. 26. <hi>verſe, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this Law to do them: and all the people ſhall ſay Amen.</hi> See <hi>Deut. 29. chap. 20 verſe,</hi> Heb. 10. Chap. 28. 29. <hi>verſes, He that deſpiſed</hi> Moſes <hi>Law, ayed without mercy, &amp;c. Of how much ſorer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath troden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the Covenant, wherewith he was ſanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done deſpite unto the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Why this <hi>kiſſing the Son,</hi> [that is loving, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on, and ſubmitting to him] <hi>is the only way to eſcape theſe curſes:</hi> I anſwer.</p>
            <p>Firſt the proper Reaſon that can be given is; <hi>The will of the great Law giver, who hath abſolute power over us, might diſpoſe of us as he pleaſes, and make us ſuch Laws and conditions as ſeem beſt to his wiſdome, upon which our juſtification and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſhould depend:</hi> he bath reſolved that this ſhall be the only condition and way: And that as no man ſhall be juſtified by a meer <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or his death abſtracted from Faith [that is of Age or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon] ſo this Faith ſhall be the condition upon which they ſhall be juſtified: or, as a <hi>Chriſt</hi> neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
<pb facs="tcp:151530:5"/>
ſhall ſave no man, ſo the accepting or recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of him, ſhall juſtify and ſave them, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the <hi>Covenant</hi> performed, under which notion it is, that faith juſtifieth. The Reaſons from the former are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the <hi>Equity,</hi> it is but equal that he that hath bought us ſo dearly, and from a ſtare ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and deplorable, ſhould be acknowledged and accepted for our Saviour and Lord. 1 Cor. 6. <hi>cha. 19. 20. verſes, And yea are not your own, for ye are bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and in your ſpirit, which are Gods.</hi> Rom. 14. <hi>chapter 9. verſe, For to this end Chriſt both dyed and roſe again that he might rule over both quick and dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As ſalvation by free grace through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is away moſt ſuitable to God's honour, and to our own neceſſities, as we could not have a more fitter way to the Father, than by Chriſt; ſo neither could there be a fitter way to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or means to partake of him, than by Fatih, it is this Faith or accep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ation of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for our <hi>Saviour</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> which is here called <hi>kiſſing the Son,</hi> applying and appropriating to our ſelves the perſon, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and benefits procured and offered, but not the leaſt honour of the work, all we do is but to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath procured, and that muſt be by the ſpecial aſſiſtance of his Holy Spirit.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Why no priviledge or power in the word can
<pb facs="tcp:151530:6"/>
ſave them that doth not kiſs the Son?</hi> it might here ſuffice, that I have ſhew'd you God's determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the contrary; but further conſider if any ſhould hope to eſcape, by their Friends, Strength, or other Endowments or Virtuous qualifications.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The muſt reſiſt the unreſiſtable will of God, they muſt do that which Heaven or Earth, men or Devils were never able yet to do; they have reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Laws and love, but they could never reſiſt his Power, where dwelleth that man, or what is his name that did neglect Chriſt and yet eſcaped dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation? Job. 9 chap. 4 verſe, <hi>who hath hardned himſelf againſt him and hath proſpered?</hi>

You hear by the Text how you are like to ſpeed at the Bar of <hi>Christ,</hi> who ſhall dye and who ſhall live, the great Aſſize is near at hand, the feet of the Judge is at the dore, go thy way unbeleiving ſinner, when thou haſt had all the pleaſure that ſin can afford thee, the rouſing voice will awake thee after thou haſt lain in duſt and flep a while, and thine Eyes ſhall ſee that dreadful day, oh bleſſed, oh doleful day, bleſſed to the Saints, doleful to the wicked: oh the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant ſhoutings of the joyful Saints, the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deous roaring cryes of the damned, when each man hath received his doom, there is nothing but Eternal glory, and eternal fire. You muſt all of you ſhortly appear, and hear what doom muſt paſs upon you, I hope you beleive it. What would you now give to know for certain how it will then go with you? why here is the book by which you muſt be judged, and here is the ſumm of it in my Text, and the grounds upon which the Judge will then proceed: will you but go along with me and anſwer the queſtions I ſhall put to you, you may know your doom</p>
            <p>And here you muſt know, that it is the Kiſs of the
<pb facs="tcp:151530:7"/>
Heart and not of Lips which we muſt here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after: the queſtions will not be at the great day of Doom, <hi>who hath ſpake Chriſt fair, or who hath called themſelves Chriſtians, or who hath ſaid the Creed or Lord's Prayer oftneſt, or cryed Lord, Lord, or come to Church, or hath held this opinion, or who that:</hi> It would make a mans heart ake to think how Zealous men honour the ſhadow of <hi>Christ,</hi> bow at his name, reverence the Image of the Croſs he dyed on, and the Reliques and names of the Saints that dyed for him, yet do utterly neglect the Lord himſelf, and reſiſt his ſpirit, and cannot endure to be governed by him, and hate them that really love him, and yet believe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be real Chriſtians. For God's ſake ſirs do not delude your immortal Souls, as to think your Baptiſm and your outward Devotion, and your good meanings as you call them, and your righteous dealing with men will ſerve the turn to prove you <hi>Christians,</hi> Alaſs! this is but with <hi>Judas</hi> to kiſs the mouth of <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed to fetch your death from thoſe bleſſed lips from whence the Saints did fetch their life, I will ſhew you ſome ſurer ſigns than theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let me a little inquire into your ſubjection to <hi>Christ:</hi> do you remember the time when you were the ſervants of Sin and Satan, and led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive at his will, and all within you was in carnal peace, do you remember when the ſpirit in the word
<pb facs="tcp:151530:7"/>
came powerfully upon your hearts, and bound Satan and caſt him out, and anſwered all your car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal wiſdome, <hi>and brought you out of darkneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to light, and from the power of Satan unto God,</hi> Acts 26. chap. 18 verſ. Hath <hi>Christ</hi> the only Soveraignty in your Souls, is his word thy Law which thou darſt not paſs, doth it bind thy thoughts unto thy tongue, and command all thou haſt, haſt thou laid down all at the feet of <hi>Christ,</hi> and reſigned all to his will, and devoted allto his diſpoſe and ſervice, doſt thou dayly and ſpiritually worſhip him in private, and in thy Family, and teach thy children and ſervants to fear the Lord; I intreat you Sirs, deal truly and faithfully in anſwering theſe queſtions, for never man was ſaved by the bare title of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> if you are not ſubject to <hi>Chriſt</hi> you are not <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,</hi> no more then a picture or a carkaſs is a man, and your Salvation will be ſuch as your <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is, <hi>Subjection</hi> is an undoubted part of thy faith, and <hi>Obedience</hi> is its fruit. In ſhort then, doſt thou make him thy fear, and tremble at his word, and be willing to do or ſuffer any thing for his ſake, as the <hi>Sword, Fire, Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Diſpleaſure</hi> of <hi>friends, Credit</hi> or <hi>Life,</hi> art thou willing to ſubmit to all that he revealeth, doſt thou ſay, <hi>ſpeak Lord for thy ſervant heareth?

frame of every ſervant of Chriſt, and this is the acknowledging and accepting of him for your Lord.</p>
            <p>Doſt thou take him for thy only Saviour, and truly beleive this hiſtory of his Life and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the truth of his Divine and humane nature, his Reſurrection, his Office, and his approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Judgement; doſt thou ſee that all thy ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Righteouſneſs is but Vanity and ſin, and that thou art not able to make the leaſt ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Law by thy works or ſufferings, and if his blood did not waſh thee, and his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs juſtify thee, thou muſt certainly be damned yet and periſh for ever; do thou therefore caſt thy ſelf into his Arms and venter thy everlaſting ſtate upon him, and truſt him with thy Soul, and fetch all thy help and healing from him, doſt thou ſo build upon his promiſe of an happineſs hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that thou canſt let all go here, <hi>and drink of His cap, and be Baptiſed with his Baptiſm, and loſe thy life upon his promiſe that thou ſhalt ſave it,</hi> why this is kiſſing the hand of Chriſt.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:151530:9"/>
I will draw theſe conſiderations only from the Text.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Thou art elſe a Rebel againſt thy Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Lord, this I gather from the command in my Text, and the whole Pſalm, God hath given thee into the hands of his Son, and made him Lord and King of all, and commanded all to ſubmit to him and accept of him; who can ſhew ſuch right to rule thee as Chriſt can do? he is thy maker, and ſo is not Satan, he dearly bought thee, ſo did not the world,</hi> 1 Pet. 1 ch. v. 18. Thou waſt not Redeemed with Silver and Gold and corruptible things from your vain converſations. <hi>I make this challenge in the behalf of Chriſt, let any thing in the world ſtep forth and ſhew a better Title to thee, to thy heart and to thy life than Chriſt can ſhew, then let them take thy heart, but I know thou canſt not but confeſs it, yet will thou not yield him thy Love and chiefeſt Obedience, out of thy own mouth then art thou condemned as a wilful Rebel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To deny thy Love and Subjection to Chriſt is a moſt barbarous unkindneſs a ſinner can be guilty of, did he pitty thee in thy loſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and take thee up when thou waſt woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the way and make thee a Plaiſter of the blood of his heart, and is this thy requital did he come down from Heaven to Earth, to ſeek
<pb facs="tcp:151530:10"/>
thee when thou waſt loſt, and take upon him all thy Debt, and put himſelf into the Priſon of the world and fleſh, and paid for thy folly, born the wrath of God which thou muſt have ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for ever, and doth he not deſerve to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with moſt affectionate reſpect,, but with a few cold thoughts inſtead of hearty love, and a few formal words inſtead of Worſhip, Oh let the Heavens bluſh at ſuch ingratitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Me thinks you ſhould rather wonder with your ſelves that ever Chriſt ſhould give you leave to love him; and ſay, <hi>Will the Lord eudure ſuch a wretch to kiſs him; will he ſuffer himſelf to be embraced by thoſe arms which hath been ſo often defiled by the imbracements of ſin, will he honour me ſo highly as to be his Subject and Servant to be guided by ſuch a bleſſed and perfect Law, and doth require no harder conditions then theſe for my Salvation: Take then my Heart O Lord, it is only thine, and oh that it were better, take it and make it better, the Spear hath made a paſſage to thy heart, O let thy spirit upon me make a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to mine.</hi> I dare challenge Earth and Hell and all the Enemies of Chriſt in both, to ſhew the leaſt hurt that ever he cauſed to the Soul of a beleiver, or wrong to the ſoul of any, and muſt he have ſuch a ſtir to do thee good, muſt he beſeech thee to be happy, and follow thee
<pb facs="tcp:151530:10"/>
with intreaties, and yet art thou like a ſtock that neither hears nor feels; nay doſt not thou murmur againſt him as if he would do thee a miſchief; Ah fooliſh Sinner it is ſin would hurt thee, and not thy Saviour, why doſt not thou ſtrive againſt that, it is the Divel that would deſtroy thee, yet doſt not grudge thy obedience to him, be judge thy ſelf whether this be equal dealing. Sinner I beſeech thee in behalf of thy poor Soul not to renounce thy Saviour, till thou haſt found a better Maſter, ſay as <hi>Peter, whither ſhall we go?</hi> Lord thou haſt the words of Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>2ly. Theſe following conſiderations are drawn from the aggravation of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all from the words of my Text.</p>
            <p n="1">1. God will be angry if you kiſs not his Son, his wrath is as a fire, and this neglect of Chriſt is the way to kindle it, if thou art not a beleiver thou art condemned already, but this will bring upon thee a double condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: oh what will the Father ſay to ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy wretches; muſt I ſend my Son from my boſome to ſuffer for thee, muſt he groan and bleed, when thou ſhouldſt bleed, and dye when thou ſhouldſt dye, and canſt thou not be perſwaded to imbrace and obey him, muſt he have the naked title of thy Lord and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, while the fleſhly pleaſures and profits
<pb facs="tcp:151530:11"/>
have thy heart; what wrath can be too great, and Hell too hot for ſuch ungrateful wretches, go ſeize upon him Juſtice, let my wrath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, and hell devour thee, ſeeing thou haſt choſen death, take it; and as thou haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Heaven, thou ſhalt never ſee it, <hi>but my wrath ſhall abide on thee for ever,</hi> John 3. Chap. 36 ver. Woe to thee ſinner if this be once thy ſentence, thou hadſt better have Heaven and Earth fall upon thee than one degree of God's diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>O what a pittyful ſight tis to ſee a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the wrath of God, and are theſe little ſparks ſo intollerably hot what then do you think are the everlaſting flames, beloved hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, if God had not ſpoke this, I durſt not have ſpoke it: the deſire of my ſoul is that you may-not feell it, I hope the foreknowing may help to prevent it. Let me tell you from God, as ſure as Heaven is over your heads, and the Earth under your feet, except the Son of God be nearer thy heart and dearer to thy heart than Friends, or goods; or Pleaſures or Life, or any thing in the world, this burning wrath will never be prevented when this wrath of God is throughly kindled, <hi>then bleſſed are they that truſt in him,</hi> Luke 14. <hi>Matt.</hi> 10. 37.</p>
            <p>And now what is your reſolution, perhaps
<pb facs="tcp:151530:11"/>
you have been Enemie to Chriſt under the name of Chriſtians, will you be ſo ſtill? have you not loathed this buſie, diligent ſerving of him, and hated them that carefully ſeek him, more than the vileſt Drunkard or Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, have not his word Service and Sabboth been a burden to you, crying <hi>away with theſe preciſe Preachers, they ſhall not controle us, this preciſe Scripture ſhall be no Law to us, and conſequently this Chriſt ſhall not rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, you may go on as far as Pharo if you will, but if you be not loſers in the latter end God hath not spoken by me 1 Kings</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sirs I am loath to leave you till the bargain be made, what ſay you, are you willing that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall be your Soveraign? his word your Law, his worſhip your Recreations, his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits your Refuge, his glory your end, and himſelf the delight of your ſouls, the Lord Jeſus waiteth for your anſwer, thou wilt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhortly wait on him for thy doom; as ever thou wouldſt have him ſpeak life to thy ſoul, do thou reſolve upon the way of Life, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that thou art almoſt at Death and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if thou didſt but ſee what others ſuffer for neglecting of him that now offereth thee his grace, what wouldſt thou do, when it comes to that, then thou wilt cry, <hi>away with the world, away Pleaſures, nothing can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
<pb facs="tcp:151530:12"/>
me but Chriſt,</hi> why then will not you be of the ſame mind now.</p>
            <p>Oh that it might ſtand with the Will of God that this Sermon might take effect upon your hearts, and faſten upon your ſouls, and pierce into your conſciences as an Arrow drawn out of the Quiver of God, it ſhould follow thee home, and bring thee down on thy Knees in ſecret, and there lament they caſe, and make thee cry out in the bitterneſs of thy ſpirit, <hi>Lord I am a ſinner that hath neglected thee, and have taſted more ſweetneſs in the world than in thy blood, and taken more delight in my earthly labours and pleaſures than in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and meditating on thee, and here it ſhould make thee lye in tears and Prayers, and follow Chriſt with cryes and complaints till he take thee up from the duſt, and aſſure thee of his pardon, and change thy heart, and cloſe it with his own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To conclude all with the words of my Text <hi>Oh kiſs the Son leaſt he be angry and you pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, bleſſed are all they that truſt in him.</hi>
