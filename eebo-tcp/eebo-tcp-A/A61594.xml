            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And I suppose those persons, whoever they are, may be able by this time, to tell Mr. <hi>S.</hi> it is an easier matter to talk of <hi>Victories</hi> than to get them. But if they do no more in the whole, than Mr. <hi>S.</hi> hath done for his share, they will triumph nowhere, but where they conquer, <hi>viz.</hi> in their own fancies and imaginations. Therefore leaving them to their silent conquests, and as yet, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard

of Victories, we come to Mr. <hi>S.</hi> who so liberally proclaims his own in the point of oral Tradition. <hi>Which</hi> (in a phrase scarce heard of in our language before) <hi>is the Post,</hi> he tells us, <hi>he hath taken upon him to explicate further and defend.</hi> What the <hi>explicating a Post</hi> means, I as little understand, as I do the force of his demonstrations; but this, and many other such uncouth forms of speech, up and down in his Book, (which make his style so smooth and easie) are I suppose intended for embellishments of our tongue, and as helps to <hi>sure-speaking,</hi> as his whole Book is designed for <hi>sure-footing.</hi>

                  <p>But letting him enjoy the pleasure <note place="margin">§. 2.</note> and felicity of his own, expressions, I come to consider the matter in debate between us. And his first controversie with me, is, <hi>for opposing the infallibility of oral tradition, to doctrinal infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">p. 203.</note>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38584:5"/>
                     <hi>Church</hi> in teaching and delivering mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith, not by vertue of any oral tradition, but the immediate assistance of the <hi>Holy Ghost:</hi> and that this is made by them the only ground of divine faith? For which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> may if he please, consult his <hi>judicious author of Labyrinthus Cantuariensis,</hi> or any other of their present Writers, except Mr. <hi>White</hi> and <hi>himself.</hi> He need not therefore have been to seek for the meaning of this doctrinal infallibility as opposed to traditionary, if he had not either been ignorant of the opinion of their own Writers, or notoriously dissembled it. For this infallibility is not attributed to the Rulers of the Church, meerly <hi>as Doctors or Scholars,</hi> but as the representative <hi>Church</hi> whose office it is to deliver all matters of faith by way of an infallible testimony to every age, and thereby to afford a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient foundation for divine faith. But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> attributes no such infallibility to the representative Church, as teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the rest, but derives their infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity from such grounds as are common to all parts of the essential Church. Wherein he apparently opposes himself
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38584:6"/>
to the whole current of their own authors, whe resolve all faith into the immediate assistance of the Holy Ghost, without which they assert there could be no infallibility at all in tradition or any thing else; and therefore these opinions are as opposite to each other as may be. For such an infallibility is not attributed by them to the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the <hi>Church,</hi> meerly <hi>on some signal occasions,</hi> as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> seems to suppose, when they are to explain new matters of faith; but it is made by them to be as necessary as believing it self, because thereby the only sure foundation of faith is laid, and therefore it is very evident they make it proper to the Church in all ages: Or else in some age of the Church men were destitute of sufficient grounds of faith. For they by no means think it a sufficient foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for faith, that one age of the Church could not conspire to deceive another; for this they will tell him at most is but a humane faith; but that Christ by his promise hath assured the Church that there shall never be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it the infallible assistance of his Holy Spirit, whereby they shall infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38584:6"/>
teach &amp; deliver all matters of faith. And if this be not their opinion, let them speak to the contrary, which if they do, I am sure they must retract their most elaborate discourses about the resolution of faith written by the greatest Artists among them. Let Mr. <hi>S.</hi> then judge <hi>who it is that stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at the Threshold:</hi> but of this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence among them more afterwards. By this it appears it was not on any mistake that I remained unsatisfied in the Question I asked, <hi>Whether am I bound to believe what the present Church delivers to be Infallible?</hi> to which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> answers, <hi>I understand him not.</hi> My reply shall be only that of a great <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers</hi> in a like case, <hi>I cannot help that.</hi> I am sure my words are intelligible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; for I take <hi>infallible</hi> there as he takes it himself, for <hi>infallibly true;</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I deny not the word to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly used in reference to things; and that for the reason given by him, <hi>because fallibility and infallibility belong to the knowing power, or the persons that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">P. 204.</note> 
                     <hi>have it, and not to the object.</hi> But we are often put to the use of that word in a sense we acknowledge improper,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38584:7"/>
meerly in complyance with our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, who otherwise are apt to charge us with having only uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and probabilities for our faith, if we do not use the term <hi>infallible</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the truth of the thing. I am content therefore wherever, in what I have writ, he meets that term so apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he take it only in his own sense, for that which is <hi>certainly true;</hi> for I mean no more by it. And in this sense Mr. <hi>S.</hi> answers affirmatively; and gives this account of it, <hi>not only because the present Church cannot be deceived in what the Church of the former Age believed, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Church in no age could conspire against her knowledge to deceive that age immediately following in matter of fact evident in a manner to the whole world.</hi> The Question then is, whether this be a sufficient account for me to believe that to be certainly true, or to be the doctrine of Christ and his Apostles, which the present Church delivers? and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently whether the resolution of faith be barely into oral tradition?</p>
                  <p>Thus we see the clear state of the <note place="margin">§ 3.</note> Question between us. I come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38584:7"/>
to the vindication of those things which I had objected against this way of resolving faith into oral tradition. Three things I especially insisted on. 1. That it is inconsistent with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions of the present Roman Church. 2. That it hath not been the way own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all ages of the Christian Church. 3. That it is repugnant to common sense and experience, and that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath apparently al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from what was the belief of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages. If these three be made good, there will be no cause to <hi>glory</hi> in this last invention to support the sinking fabrick of that Church. These three then I undertake to defend against what Mr. <hi>Serjeant</hi> hath objected against them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it is contrary to the pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the present Roman Church. And if it be so, there can be no reason for those who are of it, to rely upon it. For if so be that Church pretends that the obligation to faith arises from a quite different ground from this; how can they who believe that Church infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, venture their faith upon any other principle than what is publikly owned
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38584:8"/>
by her? And whosoever thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self bound to believe by virtue of an infallible assistance of the present Church, doth thereby shew that his obligation doth not depend upon what was delivered by the former ages of the Church. As those who believed the Apostles were infallible in their doctrine, could not resolve their faith into the infallibility of oral tradition, but into that immediate assistance by which the Apostles spake; and where there is a belief of a like assistance, the foundation of faith cannot lie in the indefectibility of tradition, but in that infallible Spirit which they suppose the Church to be assisted by. For suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing this oral tradition should fail, and that men might believe that it had actually failed, yet if the former suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition were true, there was sufficient ground for faith remaining still. And what assurance can any one have that the present Church delivers nothing for matter of faith but what hath been derived in every age from Christ and his Apostles, if such an infallible spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit be supposed in the present Church which was in the Apostles themselves?
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38584:8"/>
For on the same reason that those who heard the Apostles were not bound to trouble themselves with the tradition of the former age; no more ought they who believe the present Roman Church to have the same infallible assistance. They need not then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether this age knew the meaning of the former, or whether one age could conspire to deceive ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or whether notwithstanding both these, errours might not come into the Church; it is sufficient for them that the definitions of the present Church are infallible in all matters of faith. Therefore my demand was built on very good reason; <hi>How can you assure me the present Church obliges me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nothing but only what, and so far as it received from the former Church?</hi> And Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s answer is far from being satisfactory, <hi>That this appears by her manifect practice, never refusing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion to any man, that could approve himself to believe all the former Age did.</hi> For this may be resolved into a principle far different from this, which is the belief of the infallibility of the present Church. For supposing that,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:38584:9"/>
they are not bound to enquire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves into the reasons why the traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could not faile in any age; it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for them to believe the Church infallible; and if it be so, in proposing matters of faith, it must be so in decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what the belief of the former age was. But my demands go on, <hi>What evidence can you bring to convince me both that the Church alwayes observed this rule, and could never be deceived in it?</hi> Which question is built on these two Principles which the infallibility of oral tradition stands on. 1. That the Church must alwayes go upon this ground. 2. That if it did so, it is impossible she should be deceived. Both which are so far from that <hi>self-evidence</hi> which Mr. <hi>Serjeant</hi> still pretends to in this way, that the <hi>Jesuits</hi> principles seem much more rational and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent, than these do. For granting them but that one <hi>Postulatum,</hi> that there must be an inherent infallibility in the testimony of the present Church to afford sufficient foundation for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine faith, all the rest of their doctrine follows naturally from it. Whereas this new way of resolving faith is built
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:38584:9"/>
on such suppositions, which no man well in his wits will be ready to grant. For unless it be <hi>self-evident</hi> that the Church did alwayes proceed on this ground, it cannot be <hi>self-evident</hi> that oral tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is infallible; because the <hi>self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evidence</hi> of this principle depends on this, that in all ages of the Church, the only rule and measure of faith was, what was delivered by oral tradition from the age foregoing. Now if it be possible that matters of faith might be conveyed in wayes quite different from this, what <hi>self-evidence</hi> can there be that the Church must alwayes proceed upon this? Mr. <hi>S.</hi> then, must demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate it impossible for matters of faith to be conveyed to posterity in any other way than oral tradition; and not only that the thing is impossible, but that the Church in all ages judged it to be so; or else he can never make it at all evident that the Church alwayes made this her rule of faith. But if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there may be a certain convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the doctrine of faith another way, <hi>viz.</hi> by writing, or that the Church might judge that way more certain, whether it were so or not, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38584:10"/>
way it will appear far enough from <hi>self-evidence</hi> that she alwayes judged of doctrines of faith, meerly by the tradition of the preceding age. If ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way be granted possible, there must be clear demonstration, that the Church notwithstanding this, did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make use of it; for if it did make use of another way of resolving faith in any age of the Church, then in that age of the Church oral tradition was not looked on as the ground of faith; and if so, notwithstanding what ever Mr. <hi>S.</hi> can demonstrate to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that age might have believed otherwise that the immediately prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding did.

                  <p>But though matters of fact be plain and evident in this case, yet M. <hi>S.</hi> will <note place="margin">§. 1. 5.</note> prove it impossible there should any errours come into the <hi>Christian Church;</hi> and his main argument is this, <hi>because no age of the Church could conspire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst her knowledge to deceive that age immediately following in matter of fact evident in a manner to the whole world.</hi> But before I come more particularly to shew the weakness of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by manifesting how errours might come into the Church without such a conspiracy as this is, I shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound some Queries to him. 1. What age of the <hi>Church</hi> he will instance in wherein all persons who were not cast out of the <hi>Church,</hi> had the same appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions
<pb facs="tcp:38584:14"/>
concerning all points of faith? <hi>i. e.</hi> that none among them did believe more things delivered by Christ or the <hi>Apostles</hi> than others did. I am sure he can neither instance in the age of the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves, nor in those imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately succeeding them; unless Mr. <hi>S.</hi> the better to defend his <hi>hypothesis</hi> will question all written records because they consist of <hi>dead letters,</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senc't characters,</hi> and <hi>wordish testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</hi> Never considering that while he utters this, he writes himself; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less he imagins there is more of <hi>life, sense</hi> and <hi>certainty</hi> in his <hi>books,</hi> than in the <hi>Scriptures</hi> or any other writing whatsoever. 2. Where there were different apprehensions in one age of the Church, whether there must not be different traditions in the next? for as he looks on all Parents as bound to teach their Children, so on Children as bound to believe what their Parents teach them. On which supposition different traditions in the succeeding age must needs follow different ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions in the precedent. 3. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther persons agreeing in the substance of doctrines may not differ in their
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:38584:15"/>
apprehensions of the necessity of them? As for instance, all may agree in the article of Christs descent into hell, but yet may differ in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it, and in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of the necessity of it in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to salvation. So that we must not only in tradition about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith enquire what was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, but under what notion it was delivered; whether as an allowable opinion, or a necessary point of faith; But if several persons, nay multitudes in the Church may have different noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as to the necessity of the same points, by what means shall we discern what was delivered as an opinion in the Church, and what as an article of faith? But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> throughout his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course takes it for granted that there is the same necessity of believing and delivering all things which concern the Christian doctrine; and still sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses the same <hi>sacredness, concern, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity,</hi> in delivering all the points in controversie between the <hi>Romanists</hi> and Us, as there was in those main ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of faith, which they and we are agreed in. Which is so extravagant a
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:38584:15"/>
supposition that it is hard to conceive it should ever enter into the head of a person pretending to reason; but as extravagant as it is, it is that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which his whole fabrick falls to the ground. For suppose we should grant him that the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite errors which depend on the belief of the <hi>Christian doctrine</hi> should be of so prevalent nature with the world, that it is impossible to conceive any one age should neglect the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, or conspire to deceive the next age about them; yet what is all this to the matters in difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us? Will Mr. <hi>S.</hi> prove the same <hi>sacredness, necessity, concern, and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously attestedness</hi> (as he phrases it) in the <hi>Invocation of Saints, Purgatory, Transubstantiation, Supremacy,</hi> &amp;c. as in the believing the death and resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Son of God: if he doth not prove this, he doth nothing; for his arguments may hold for doctrines judged universally necessary, but for no other. Therefore Mr. <hi>S.</hi> hath a new task which he thought not of; which is, to manifest that these could not be looked on as <hi>opinions,</hi> but were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:38584:16"/>
as <hi>necessary articles</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> For unless he proves them such, he can neither prove any obligation in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to teach them their <hi>Children,</hi> nor in <hi>Children</hi> to believe what their <hi>Parents</hi> taught, but only to hold them in the same degree which they did themselves. When Mr. <hi>S.</hi> will undertake to prove that the whole <hi>Church</hi> from the time of Christ did agree in the points in difference between us, as necessary articles of faith, I may more easily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that no age could be ignorant of them, or offer to deceive the next about them. But when Mr. <hi>S.</hi> reflects on his frequent concession that there are <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate opinions</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> distinct from <hi>matters of faith,</hi> he must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber before he can bring home his grounds to the case between their <hi>Church</hi> and ours, that he must prove none of the things in debate, were ever entertained as <hi>private opinions,</hi> and that it is impossible for that which was a <hi>private opinion</hi> in one age, to become a <hi>matter of faith</hi> in the next.</p>
                  <p>But because this distinction of his <note place="margin">§. 6.</note>

Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther those persons who did themselves believe those opinions to be true, did not think themselves obliged to tell others they ought to believe them; and consequently to deliver these as matters of faith to their children? Let Mr. <hi>S.</hi> shew me any inconsequence in this; but that it unavoidably follows upon his principles that they were bound to teach their Children what themselves received as the doctrine of Christ, and that the obligation is in all respects equal as if they had believed these things on the account of <hi>oral tradition.</hi> 4 If Children be obliged to believe what their Parents teach them for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith, then upon Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s. own concessions is not posterity bound to believe something which originally came not from <hi>Christ</hi> or his <hi>Apostles?</hi> For it appears in this case, that the first rise was from a private opinion of some <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> but they believing these opinions themselves, think themselves obliged to propagate them to others; and by reason of their learning and authority, these opinions may by degrees gain a general accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance

sense of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> they might produce <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t and rely upon it. So that the whole <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>se of <hi>Tradition</hi> in the primitive <hi>Church</hi> (besides attesting the books) was, to shew the unreasonableness of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mposing senses on <hi>Scripture,</hi> against the universal sense of the <hi>Church</hi> from the <hi>Apostles</hi> times. But as long as men were men, it was not avoidable, but they must fall into different apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the meaning of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> according to their different judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, prejudices, learning and educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And since they had all this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension that the <hi>Scripture</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all doctrines of faith, thence as men judged of the sense of it, they differed in their apprehension, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning matters of faith. And thence errors and mistakes might easily come into the <hi>Church</hi> without one age conspiring to deceive the next. Nay if it be possible for men to rely on tradition without <hi>Scripture,</hi> this may easily be done; for by that means they make a new rule of faith not known to the primitive <hi>Church,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that very assertion is an error in which the former age did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:38584:21"/>
to deceive the next. And if these things be possible, M. <hi>S</hi>'s. demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fails him; for hereby a reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able account is given how errors may come into a <hi>Church</hi> without one age conspiring to deceive another. Again, let me enquire of Mr. <hi>S.</hi> whether men may not believe it in the power of the ruling part of the <hi>Church</hi> to oblige the whole to an assent to the definitions of it? To speak plainer, is it not possible for men to believe the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Council infallible</hi> in their <hi>decrees?</hi> And I hope the <hi>Jesuits</hi> (as little as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> loves them, or they him) may be a sufficient evidence of more than the bare possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of this. If they may believe this, doth it not necessarily follow that they are bound to believe whatever they declare to be matter of faith? sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing then that <hi>Transubstantiation, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy, Invocation</hi> of <hi>Saints,</hi> were but <hi>private opinions</hi> before, but are now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined by <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Council,</hi> these men cannot but look on themselves as much obliged to believe them, as if they had been delivered as matters of faith, in every age since the <hi>Apostles</hi> times. Is it now repugnant to common sense,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:38584:21"/>
that this opinion should be believed or entertained in the <hi>Church?</hi> if not, why may not this opinion be generally received? if it be so, doth it not una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably follow that the faith of men must alter according to the <hi>Churches</hi> definitions? And thus <hi>private opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> may be believed as <hi>articles of faith,</hi> and <hi>corrupt practices</hi> be established as <hi>laudable pieces of devotion,</hi> and yet no one age of the <hi>Church</hi> conspire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive another. Thus I hope Mr. <hi>S.</hi> may see how far it is from being a <hi>self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evident principle, that no error can come into the</hi> Church, <hi>unless one age conspire to deceive the next in a matter of fact evident in a manner to the whole world.</hi> Which is so wild an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that I believe the <hi>Jesuits</hi> cannot entertain themselves without smiles to see their <hi>domestick adversaries</hi> expose themselves to contempt with so much confidence.</p>
                  <p>Thus I come to the reason I gave <note place="margin">§. 8.</note> why there is no reason to believe that this is the present sense of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> My words are, <hi>For I see the Roman Church asserts, that things may
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:38584:22"/>
be</hi> de fide <hi>in one age, which were not in another; at least Popes and Councils chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge this; and this is the common do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine maintained there, and others are looked on as no members of their C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>urch, who assert the contrary; but as p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rsons at least meritoriously if not actually excommunicate. Where then shall I satisfie my self what the sense of your Church is as to this particular? Must I believe a very few persons whom the rest disown as heretical and soditious? or ought I not rather to take the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the greatest and most approved persons of that Church? And these dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own any such doctrine, but assert that the Church may determine things</hi> de fide <hi>which were not before.</hi> In answer to this, Mr. <hi>S. begs leave to distinguish the words</hi> de fide <hi>which may either mean</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>p.</hi> 05.</note> 
                     <hi>Christian faith or points of faith taught by Christ; and then he grants 'tis non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense to say they can be in one age, and not in another. Or</hi> de fide <hi>may mean obligatory to be believed. In this latter sense none I think</hi> (saith he) <hi>denies things may be</hi> de fide <hi>in one age and not in another; in the former sense none holds it.</hi> Upon which very trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:38584:22"/>
he concludes, <hi>What<hi rend="sup">r</hi>s now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of your difficulty? I believe you are in some wonderment, and think I elude it rather then answer it; I shall endeavour to unperplex you.</hi> I must confess it a fault of humane nature to admire things which men understand not; on which account I cannot free my self from some temptation to that he calls <hi>wonderment;</hi> but I am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently cured of it when I endeavour to reduce his distinction to reason. For instead of explaining his terms he should have shewed how any thing can be obligatory to be believed in any age of the <hi>Church,</hi> which was no point of faith taught by <hi>Christ,</hi> which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his endeavour to <hi>unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex me,</hi> is a thing as yet I apprehend not: Because I understand no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to faith to arise from any thing but <hi>divine revelation:</hi> and I do not yet believe any thing in <hi>Christian do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> to be divinely revealed, but what was delivered by <hi>Christ</hi> or his <hi>Apostles.</hi> And my <hi>wonderment</hi> must needs be the greater, because I suppose this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s. principles. For oral tradition doth necessarily imply
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:38584:23"/>
that all points of <hi>faith</hi> were first taught by <hi>Christ,</hi> and conveyed by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to us; but if a thing may be <hi>de side</hi> in this latter sense which was not before, what becomes of resolving faith wholly into <hi>oral tradition?</hi> For <hi>faitb</hi> is <hi>resolved</hi> into that from whence the <hi>obligation</hi> to <hi>believe</hi> comes; but here Mr. <hi>S.</hi> confesses that the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to believe doth arise from some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing quite different from <hi>oral traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> and therefore faith must be resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into it. Besides, all the sense I can find in that distinction, is, that men are bound to believe something in one age, which they were not in another; and if so, I shall desire Mr. <hi>S.</hi> to <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perplex me</hi> in this, how every age is bound to believe just as the precedent did, and yet one age be bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve more then the precedent. But however, I am much obliged to him for his endeavour to <hi>unperplex me</hi> as he speaks: for really I look on no civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to be greater than those which are designed for clearing our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings: so great an adorer am I of true reason and an intelligible Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                     <hi>aims not to make us beasts, but more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly men: and the perfection of our manhood consists in the use of our reasons.</hi> From whence he inferrs, that it is reasonable, consequences should be drawn from principles of faith, <hi>which,</hi> he saith, <hi>are of two sorts; first such as need no more but common sense to deduce them; the others are such as need the maxims of some science got by specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to infer them; and these are Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical conclusions: the former sort,</hi> he tells us, <hi>the church is necessitated to make use of upon occasion,</hi> i. e. <hi>when any heretick questions those, and</hi> eadem opera, <hi>the whole point of faith it self, of which they were a part; as in the case of the Monothelites, about Christs ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving two wills.</hi> But all this while, I am far enough from being <hi>unperplexed:</hi> nay by this discourse I see every one who offers to <hi>unperplex</hi> another is not very <hi>clear</hi> himself. For since he makes no <hi>Theological conclusions</hi> to be <hi>de side,</hi> but only such <hi>consequences as common sence drawes,</hi> I would willingly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand how <hi>common sence</hi> receives a new obligation to faith. For to my
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:38584:24"/>
apprehension the deducing of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences from principles by <hi>common sense,</hi> is not an act of believing, but of knowledge consequent upon a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of faith. And the meaning is no more then this, that men when they say they believe things, should not contradict themselves, as certainly they would do, if they deny those <hi>conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences</hi> which <hi>common sense</hi> draws from them. As in the case of the <hi>Monothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> for men to assert that <hi>Christ</hi> had <hi>two natures,</hi> and yet not <hi>two wills,</hi> when the <hi>will</hi> is nothing else but the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the <hi>nature</hi> to that <hi>good</hi> which belongs to it. So that there can be no distinct obligation to believe such <hi>consequences</hi> as are drawn by common sense; but every one that believes the <hi>principles</hi> from whence they are drawn, is thereby bound to believe all the consequences which immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from them. Indeed the <hi>Church,</hi> when people will be so unreasonable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such things, may explain her sense of the article of faith in those terms which may best prevent dispute; but this is only to discriminate the persons who truly believe this article from
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:38584:24"/>
such as do not. Not that any new obligation to faith results from this act of the <hi>Church:</hi> but the better to prevent cavils, she explains her sense of the article it self in more explicite terms. <hi>Which</hi> as he saith, <hi>is only to put the faith out of danger of being</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>equivocated.</hi> Which is quite another thing from causing a new obligation to believe. As suppose the <hi>Church</hi> to prevent the growth of the <hi>Socinian doctrine,</hi> should, require from men the declaring their belief of the <hi>eternal existence</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> Would this be to bind men to believe some thing which they were not bound to before? no, but only to express their assent to the <hi>Deity</hi> of Christ in the simplest terms; because otherwise they might call him <hi>God</hi> by <hi>office,</hi> and not by <hi>nature.</hi> Now how can any one conceive that any should be first ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to believe that <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>God;</hi> and yet receive a new obligation after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to believe his <hi>eternal existence?</hi> Thus it is in all <hi>immediate consequences</hi> drawn by <hi>common sense;</hi> in all which the primary obligation to believe the thing it self, extends to the belief of

Mr. <hi>s.</hi> mistake lies here, in not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing the obligation to believe, from the obligation to an explicite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of that assent. The former comes only from God, and no new ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation can arise from any act of the <hi>Church;</hi> but the latter being a thing tending to the <hi>Churches</hi> peace, may be required by it on some occasions; <hi>i. e.</hi> when the doctrine is assaulted by <hi>hereticks</hi> as in the time of the <hi>four first General Councils:</hi> but still a man is not at all the more obliged to assent, but to express his assent in order to the <hi>Churches</hi> satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> supposes me to enquire, <note place="margin">§. 9. <hi>p.</hi> 208.</note> 
                     <hi>how the Church can have power to oblige the Generality to belief of such a point.</hi> To which his answer is, <hi>she obliges them to believe the main point of faith, by vertue of traditions being a self-evident rule, and these implyed points by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their being self-evidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with those main and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually used points, so that the vulgar can be rationally and connaturally made capable of this their obligation.</hi> But we are not now enquiring what the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to believe the main points of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:38584:26"/>
faith is, nor whether traditiou be a <hi>self-evident rule;</hi> but how there should be <hi>a new obligation to believe something self-evidently connected with the former points,</hi> is beyond my capacity to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand. And they must be <hi>vulgar un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings</hi> indeed, that can <hi>rationally and connaturally</hi> be made capable of such an obligation. For if it be self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evidently connected with the main points, no one can believe the one, without believing the other: for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is <hi>self-evident</hi> but what a man assents to at the first apprehension of it; and if he doth so, how comes there a new obligation to believe it?

Which in short is, that all in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> who are not of his opinion, know not what they say; and that they oppose that which they do really believe.

According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their Books are censured at <hi>Rome,</hi> their opinions disputed against, and their persons condemned. And yet all this while, we must believe that <hi>these</hi> stick together like two smooth Marbles <hi>as faithful,</hi> though they are knocked one against another <hi>as discoursers;</hi> and that they perfectly agree in the same <hi>self-evident rule</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> when all their quarrels and contentions are about it: and those managed with so great heat, that <hi>heresie</hi> is charged of one side, and <hi>Arch-heresie</hi> and <hi>undermining Religion</hi> on the other.

                     <hi>such ill words</hi> as they do each other. For let Mr. <hi>S.</hi> shew us wherein we differ more from him about the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> than they do among themselves: For Mr, <hi>White</hi> when he hath said, <hi>that all kind of heresie doth arise from hence that men make the holy Scripture, or a private spirit, the rule of faith;</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> adds, <hi>it is all one, if one make councils or Pope any other way than as witnesses to be the authors of faith. For, saith</hi> he, <hi>this is to subject the whole Church to that slavery, to receive any er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour for an article of faith, which they shall define, or propose</hi> modo illegitimo, i. e. <hi>any other way then as witnesses of tradition.</hi> Either then we differ from Mr. <hi>S.</hi> only <hi>as discoursers,</hi> or he and his Brethren differ from each other more then as such. And so any one would think who reads the oppositions and arguments against each other on this subject, particularly Mr. <hi>Whites Tabulae suffragiales.</hi> But let Mr. <hi>White</hi> say what he will, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> tells me, <hi>I am not aware how little they differ even as Divines.</hi> The more shame for them to have such furious <note place="margin">

so little difference.

And therefore I see little reason to believe, that this was either the sense of the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> or is the sense of any number of <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> much less <hi>of the whole Church none excepted</hi> as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> in his <note place="margin">
                        <hi>p.</hi> 212.</note> confident way expresses it. <hi>And if he will,</hi> as he saith, <hi>disavow the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any point, or affecting any way which is not assented to by all,</hi> I hope to see Mr. <hi>S.</hi> retract this opinion, and either fall in with the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:38584:35"/>
or return as reason leads him into the bosom of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> But there seems to be somewhat more in what follows, viz. <hi>that though school<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men question the personal infallibility of the Pope, or of the Roman Clergy, nay of a General Council, yet all affirm the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of tradition, or the living voice of the Church essential; and this,</hi> he faith, <hi>is held by all, held firmly,</hi> and <hi>that it is absolutely infallible.</hi> To this therefore I answer; either Mr. <hi>S.</hi> means that none do affirm that the <hi>universal tradition</hi> of the <hi>Church essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi> can erre; or that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> being the <hi>Church essential</hi> cannot erre in her tradition: But which way soever he takes it, I shall easily shew how far it is from proving that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs it for. For if he take it in the first sense, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>all</hi> the <hi>faithful</hi> in <hi>all ages</hi> could not concur in an error, then he may as well prove <hi>Protestants</hi> of his mind as <hi>Papists,</hi> for this is the foundation on which we believe the particular books of <hi>Scripture.</hi> If this therefore proves any thing, it proves more then he intends, <hi>viz.</hi> that while we thus oppose each other, we do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:38584:36"/>
agree together; and truly so we do, as much as they do among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. But if Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s. meaning be, <hi>that all of their Religion own the Roman Church to be the Church essential, and on that account, that it cannot erre</hi> (setting aside the absurdity of the opinion it self) I say from hence it doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that they make <hi>or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>l tradition</hi> the rule of <hi>faith,</hi> because it is most evident that the ground why they say thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Church</hi> cannot erre, is not on Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s. <hi>principles,</hi> but on the supposition of an <hi>infallible assistance</hi> which preserves that <hi>Church</hi> from error. So that this fall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> far short of proving that they are all agreed in this rule of faith; which is a thing so far from probability, that he might by the same argument prove that <hi>Scripture</hi> is owned by them all to be the rule of faith. For I hope <hi>it is held by all,</hi> and <hi>held firmly</hi> that the living voice of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>Scripture</hi> as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered to us is <hi>infallible;</hi> and if so then there is as much ground for this as the other. But if we enquire what it is men make a <hi>rule</hi> of <hi>faith,</hi> we must know not only that they believe <hi>tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion infallible,</hi> but on what account they
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:38584:36"/>
do. so. For if tradition be believed <hi>infallible</hi> barely on the account of a promise of <hi>infallibility</hi> to the <hi>present Church,</hi> then the resolution of saith is not into the <hi>tradition,</hi> but into that <hi>infallible assistance;</hi> and consequently the rule of faith is not, what bare tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition delivers, but what that <hi>Church</hi> which cannot erre in judging traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth propose to us. It is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their being agreed in <hi>General that tradition is infallible</hi> doth make them agree in the same <hi>rule</hi> of <hi>faith;</hi> but they must agree in the ground of that <hi>infallibility,</hi> viz. that it depends on this, <hi>that no age could conspire to deceive the next.</hi> But all persons who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand any thing of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> know very well that the general rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why tradition is believed infallible is, because they first believe the <hi>Church</hi> to be <hi>infallible;</hi> whereas Mr. <hi>S.</hi> goes the contrary way, and makes the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> to depend on the <hi>infallibility</hi> of <hi>Tradition.</hi> And therefore for all that I can see we must still oppose <hi>private opinators</hi> in this controversie; the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> not having declared her self at all
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:38584:37"/>
on Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s behalf, but the contrary: and the generality believing on the account of the present <hi>Churches</hi> infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility. And it is strange Mr. <hi>S.</hi> should find no difference between mens resolving faith into common sense, and into the immediate assistance of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> If this then <hi>be the first principle of controversie,</hi> as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>p.</hi> 213.</note> pretends, we see how unlikely they are to agree about other matters, who are so much divided about the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of resolving them. And if this be the ground of faith, then most <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> build on a wrong Foundation. But if the <hi>infallibility of oral tradition,</hi> be the foundation on which <hi>that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable structure is erecting,</hi> which he speaks of; woe then to the <hi>Court of Rome,</hi> for that is known to build on quite a different foundation. And <hi>if this,</hi> as he saith, <hi>rises apace, and has advanced many stories in a small time,</hi> it only lets us know how fast their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions grow, and that they are build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so fast one against another, that their <hi>Church</hi> will not stand between them. By this discourse, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends <hi>to answer all those If's which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;</hi>
                     <pb n="71" facs="tcp:38584:37"/>
which are these, <hi>In case the Church may determine things</hi> de fide <hi>which were not before, whether the present Church doth then believe as the precedent did or no? if it did, how comes any thing to be</hi> de fide <hi>which was not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? if it did not, what assurance can I have that every age of the Church believes just as the precedent did and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise? When I see they profess the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And if a thing may be</hi> de fide <hi>in one age which was not in a foregoing, then a Church may deliver that as a matter of faith at one time, which was never accounted so before: by which means the present Church may oblige me to believe that as a matter of faith, which never was so in Christs or the Apostles times, and so the infallibility on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of tradition is destroyed.</hi> To all which Mr. <hi>S.</hi> gives a very easie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer: viz. <hi>that they do not hold any disparate or unimplyed points of faith; but such as are involved and implyed in the main point.</hi> This is more easily said then understood: For if these be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in the former, how can there come a new obligation to believe them? For to take his own Instance,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:38584:38"/>
will any man in his senses say, <hi>that he that believes, homo est animal rationale,</hi> doth not believe <hi>homo est animal?</hi> and this he makes choice of as an example <hi>how one point of faith may be involved in another so as to receive a distinct obligation to believe it.</hi> I grant that <hi>homo est animal</hi> is involved in the other, but he that shall say, that after he hath assented to that proposition, <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo est animal rationale,</hi> he may be capable of a new obligation to believe the former which is involved in this, it may be justly questioned whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such a one as to himself can truly say, <hi>homo est animal ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nale</hi> or no. But after such rare subtilties, he doth very well to tell me, <hi>that I ought to consider what Logick tells us, that the conclusion is in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises, which reflection</hi> (in his court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like expression) he saith <hi>will much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blunder</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>p.</hi> 214.</note> 
                     <hi>my thoughts.</hi> But let the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion be as long as it will in the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,</hi> will any man in his wits say, that he that believes the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> is not thereby bound to believe the conclusion? and the more the one is involved in the other, the less is it
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:38584:38"/>
possible to make the obligation to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them distinct. And it is hard for me to believe, that this is a way <hi>to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blunder my thoughts,</hi> when I see what horrible confusion such expressions ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue in his own. Let the <hi>Church</hi> then clear her thoughts never so much, yet all this cannot amount to a distinct obligation to believe those things which were involved before, but to a more explicit declaring them for the <hi>Churches</hi> peace and satisfaction. The only conclusion then involved in these premises is, that if some things may be <hi>de fide</hi> in one age which were not in another, then the present age may believe otherwise then the precedent did. And if this doctrine be held in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> nothing can be more evident, then that Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s. <hi>first principle of controversie,</hi> is far from being the doctrine of the <hi>Roman Church:</hi> which was the thing to be proved.</p>
                  <p>My second chief argument against <note place="margin">§. 13.</note> this way of <hi>oral tradition</hi> was, <hi>that it had not been owned in all ages of the Christian Church;</hi> to manifest which, I enquired into the reason of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:38584:39"/>
in any age of the <hi>Church</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and practise just as the precedent did. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> rejoyces in that confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mine, <hi>that the only thing to be</hi>

                     <hi>proved in this case is, that every age of the Church and all persons in it looked on themselves as obliged not to vary in any thing from the doctrine and practise of the precedent age.</hi> And I there offer the choice of three wayes to prove it, <hi>reason, testimony</hi> Or <hi>tradition;</hi> he tells me, <hi>he accepts the way of reason;</hi> yet quarrels with me for pressing for a <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrative medium</hi> to prove it, when yet Mr. <hi>S.</hi> seldome speaks unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

faith be wholly the written word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed from age to age, I deny not but an obligation to believe descends with the doctrine to every succeeding age.

And this is that which I deny, and desire Mr. <hi>S.</hi> to prove For which he first gives us a large instance in hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storical matters, and then comes to the matters of <hi>Christian saith.</hi> His Instance is, <hi>in Alexanders conquest of</hi> Asia, <hi>as to which</hi> he saith, <hi>that the memory of it is fresh and lively, though some thousand</hi>

                     <hi>years since. And that the universal and strong perswasion of this matter of fact was not caused by Books, as</hi> Curtius <hi>his History, but by humane tradition: that the continuance of this perswasion was the notoriety of the fact to the then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers which obliged them to relate it to their posterity, and that this testifying

by the fore-fathers was that which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged posterity to believe things as true, because there could be no imaginable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive why the whole world should conspire to deceive them, or be deceivable in their sensations: on which principle it passed to the next age, and so came down by way of tradition to our dayes: and the obligation to believe in every age depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this that the senses of the first could not be deceived; and having this security in every age that no one would conspire to deceive the next; it followes that no age could say a former age te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified so, unless it did so; therefore,</hi> saith he, <hi>it follows demonstratively that it was testified; and so the descendents in every age to the very end of the world have the same obligation to believe their immediate fore-fathers saying it was testified by theirs, and so to the very first who were witnesses of his actions.</hi> This is the substance of what he more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly discourses in several Paragraphs; which when he hath done, he tells me, <hi>he expects what I will reply to this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</hi> Not to frustrate therefore his <note place="margin">

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:38584:42"/>
that in the present case there are two distinct questions to be resolved. 1. How a <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>fact</hi> evident to the world comes to be conveyed to posterity? 2. By what means a compleat history of all passages relating to it may be conveyed? As <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But if we enquire into that which is alone proper to our Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> by what means we may judge what is <hi>true</hi> and <hi>false</hi> as to the <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars</hi> of that <hi>conquest,</hi> then I deny that bare <hi>tradition</hi> is to be relyed on in this case. For the certainty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of all particulars doth depend not upon the <hi>bare veracity,</hi> but the <hi>capacity</hi> and <hi>skill</hi> of <hi>communicating</hi> from one age to another. For which one would think we need no clearer evidence then the considerations of the different account of former <hi>times</hi> in the several Nations of the world. For who can imagine, but the <hi>barbarous Nations</hi> were as unwilling to deceive their posterity as any other? yet we

see a vast difference in the <hi>histories</hi> of former <hi>ages</hi> among them, and more civilized people. And I wish Mr. <hi>S.</hi> would rather have instanced in some history which had been preserved meerly by tradition and not in such a one, which, if any other, hath been most carefully recorded and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to posterity.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:38584:44"/>
matters of <hi>fact</hi> which are done in it, as to the grounds and particulars of them. To give Mr. <hi>S.</hi> an instance home to his purpose, in the late <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent;</hi> we see already what different repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations there are made of it in so little a time as hath already passed since the sitting of it. One, though he had all the advantages imaginable of knowing all proceedings in it, living at the same time, conversing with the persons present at it, having the <hi>memoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> and records of the <hi>Secretaries</hi> themselves, yet his story is since en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to be blasted by a great person of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> as fictiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and partial. We see then it is at least supposed that interest and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice may have a great hand in abusing the world in matter of story, though one-age never agree to deceive ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And in stead of being perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s. demonstrations, I am still of the mind, that we have no suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicient security of the truth of any sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which was not written while those persons were in being who were able to contradict the errors of it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I deny not but some notorious
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:38584:45"/>
matters of fact, such as <hi>Alexanders</hi> bare <hi>conquest</hi> of <hi>Asia,</hi> might by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible effects of it be preserved both in <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Greece</hi> for a long time. But if we come to enquire particularly whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this or that was done by him in his conquest, which is alone pertinent to our purpose, we have no security at all from tradition, but only from the most authentick records of that story. And by this, I hope Mr. <hi>S.</hi> will have cause to thank me for <hi>unblundering his thoughts</hi> (his own civil expression) and shewing him how errors may come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a story without one age conspiring to deceive the next; and what a vast difference there is between preserving a bare matter of fact, and all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars relating to it. And hereby he may easily see how far the obligation extends in believing the report of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages. For there can be no obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to believe any further then there is evidence of truth in the matter we are obliged to. If then there be not only a possibility but a very great probability of mistakes and errors in matters of fact, I pray what obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth there lye upon men abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:38584:45"/>
to believe what is delivered by the preceding age? But to put an issue to this controversie, let Mr. <hi>S.</hi> exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine himself, and try if he can name one story that was never written, which was ever certainly popagated from one age to another by meer oral tradition; and if he cannot, he may thereby see how little real force his argument hath in the world. For all the force of tradition lies in an unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable conveyance of those <hi>books,</hi> which contain in them the true reports of the actions of the times they were written in. But can Mr. <hi>S.</hi> think, that if the <hi>Roman history</hi> had never been written, it had been possible for us to have known what was done under the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Consuls</hi> as now we do? yet if his principle holds, this necessarily follows; for <hi>those of that age could not but know them,</hi> and <hi>no age since could conspire to deceive the next.</hi> And from hence, the most useful consequence of all is that Mr. <hi>S.</hi> might have writ a history from the beginning of the world to this day, with a full relation of all <hi>particulars,</hi> if there had never been any <hi>book</hi> written in the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

And doth not Mr. <hi>S.</hi> deserve immortal credit for so rare an inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as this is, and all built on nothing short of <hi>demonstrations:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> very prudently <hi>foresees, what it is I must be forced to recurre to,</hi>

                        <hi>p.</hi> 224.</note> viz. <hi>that being baffled with his former demonstration, I have no other shift to betake my self to, but to say the case is different between histories and points of faith.</hi> And therefore to bring his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness home, he applyes it at large to the delivery of the <hi>Christian faith,</hi> which that he might do in more ample sort, he very finely descants on the old <hi>Verse, Quis, quid, ubi,</hi> &amp;c. containing the circumstances of human actions, and from every one of them derives arguments for the <hi>infallibility</hi> of <hi>oral tradition:</hi> which briefly and in plain <hi>English</hi> may be summed up thus; <hi>Since the author of this doctrine was the son of God, the doctrine it self so excellent, and delivered in so publick a manner, in the most convincing way by miracles and good living, and for so good an end as to save mens souls, and that by writing it in mens hearts and testified
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:38584:46"/>
to others; and all this at a time when men might judge of the miracles and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives for believing it; therefore since in all these respects it was imcomparably beyond the story of</hi> Alexanders <hi>conquests, it follows that in a manner infinitely greater must the obligation be to believe Christs doctrine, than</hi> Alexanders <hi>or</hi> William <hi>the Conquerours victories, or any history of the like nature whatsoever.</hi> All which I freely grant, but cannot yet see how from thence it follows that <hi>oral tradition is the only rule of faith,</hi> or the means whereby we are to judge what is the <hi>doctrine</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and what not. Those arguments I confess prove that the <hi>Christians</hi> of the first age were highly concerned to enquire into the truth of these things, and that they had the greatest reason imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to believe them; and that it is not possible to conceive that they should not endeavour to propagate so excellent a doctrine and of so high concernment to the world. But the question is, whether abstractly from the <hi>books</hi> written in the first age of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> there is so much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility in the <hi>oral tradition</hi> of every
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:38584:47"/>
age, that nothing could be embraced for Christs doctrine which was not and consequently whether every age were bound to believe absolutely what was delivered it by the precedent for the doctrine of <hi>Christ?</hi> Mr. <hi>S.</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore puts himself to a needless task of proving that every age was bound to believe the <hi>doctrine of Christ,</hi> which I never questioned; but the dispute is, whether every age be bound on the account of <hi>oral tradition</hi> to believe what is delivered by the precedent for <hi>Christs doctrine.</hi> But it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served all along how carefully Mr. <hi>S.</hi> avoids mentioning the <hi>written books</hi> of the <hi>New Testament;</hi> because he knew all his game about oral tradition would be quite spoiled by a true stating the matter of fact in the first ages of the <hi>Christian Church.</hi> I hope he will not be angry with me, for asking him that question about the <hi>Scripture,</hi> which he asks me about the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent; did he never hear of such a thing as the Scripture? or is it so hard to find it?</hi> But if he hath heard of it, I intreat him to resolve me these <hi>Questions.</hi> 1.

And that these books were written by those persons whose names they bear, I appeal to Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s. own rule, <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> for if that be infallible in any thing, it must be in this; and if one age could conspire to deceive another in a matter of such concernment,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:38584:48"/>
what security can be had, that it may not do so in all other things? 2. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he believes that those whose in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was to write an account of the life, actions and doctrine of <hi>Christ,</hi> did leave any thing out of their books which did relate to them as of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment for us to believe? For upon Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s principles, any one may easily know what the tradition of the <hi>Church</hi> is; and especially such certainly who were either present themselves at the matters of fact, or heard them from those who were; and what satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on can any one desire greater then this? But the question is, whether this testimony were not more safely depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited in the <hi>Church</hi> to be conveyed by word of mouth, then it could be by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing committed to writing by such who were eye and ear-witnesses o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Whether those things which are capable of being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood when they are spoken, cease to be so when they are written? For Mr. <hi>S.</hi> seems to understand those terms of a <hi>living voice,</hi> and <hi>dead letters</hi> in a very strict and rigorous manner; as though the sense were only <hi>quick</hi> when spoken, and became buried in <hi>dead let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> But Mr. <hi>S.</hi> seems with the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacious <hi>Indian</hi> to admire how it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for <hi>dead letters</hi> and <hi>unsenc'd cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters</hi> to express mens meanings as well as words.

Ergo</hi> in every age there is an absolute obligation to believe the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the present <hi>Church.</hi> The <hi>minor</hi> he thus proves. If no age of the <hi>Church</hi> can be ignorant of what the precedent taught, or conspire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the next, then there is no possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of error coming into the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the <hi>Church</hi> in any age; but the antecedent is true, and therefore the consequent. Now who sees not that the force of all this, lyes not in proving the <hi>minor proposition,</hi> or that no age could conspire to deceive ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? but the consequence, <hi>viz.</hi> that no error can come into a <hi>Church,</hi> but by a general mistake in one whole age, or the general imposture of it, which we utterly deny: and have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him already the falsness of it from his own concessions. And I might more largely shew it from those do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>weakness of this way.</hi> For without pretending to be either of these, I have
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:38584:51"/>
found out another way of attaquing it, then Mr. <hi>S.</hi> looked for: <hi>viz.</hi> from his own principles and concessions; shewing how errors might come into a Church, without a total deception or conspiracy in any one age. Which if it be true, he cannot bind me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what ever he tells me the present Church delivers, unless he can prove that this never came into the Church as a speculation or private opinion, and from thence by degrees hath come to be accounted a point of faith. Therefore his way of proof is now quite altered, and he cannot say we are bound to believe whatever the present Church delivers; for that which he calls the present Church, may have admitted speculations and private opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions into doctrines of faith; but he must first prove such doctrines delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Christ or his Apostles, and that from his time down to our age they have been received by the whole Church for matters of faith; and when he hath done this, as to any of the points in controversie between us, I will promise him to be his <hi>Proselyte.</hi> But he ought still to remember that he

is not to prove it impossible for one whole age to conspire to deceive the next; but that supposing that, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for any errors to come into the tradition of the Church. Let us now see what Mr. <hi>S.</hi> objects against those words I then used, against the demonstrating this way; <hi>It is hard to conceive what reason should inforce it but such as proves the impossibility of the contrary; and they have understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of another mould from others who can conceive it impossible men should not think themselves obliged to believe and do all just as their predecessors.</hi> And whatever Mr. <hi>S.</hi> sayes to the contrary, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>p.</hi> 234.</note> I cannot yet see, but that therein I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued <hi>from the very nature and constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the thing.</hi> For that which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> looked for, was a <hi>demonstration,</hi> which I supposed could not be unless the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility of the contrary were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated. But if it be possible, for men, <hi>Christians,</hi> nay <hi>Romanists</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on other accounts then the tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the precedent age, I pray what demonstration can there be, that men must think themselves obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and do all just as their predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:38584:52"/>
did? Surely if Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s. fancy had not been very extravagant, he could never have thought here of <hi>mens being obliged to cut their Beards, or wear such Garters and Hat-bands as their fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers did.</hi> For do I not mention <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving first and then doing?</hi> by which it were easie to apprehend, that I meant matters of faith, and such pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises as flow from them. Neither was there any such <hi>crafty and sophisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal dealing</hi> as he charges me with; for <note place="margin">
                        <hi>p.</hi> 235.</note> I am content his doctrine be taken in his own terms; and I have now given a larger and fuller account why I am far from being convinced by the way he hath used for resolving faith. Passing by therefore his challenge, which I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of, as long as he holds to the <hi>weapon</hi> of <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>civility,</hi> I come to consider his last enquiry, <hi>why I should come to doubt of such an obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>in posterity to believe their ancestors in matters of faith;</hi> and he judiciously resolves it into <hi>a strange distortion of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature,</hi> but such as it seems, is the proper effect of the <hi>Protestants temper,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>which is,</hi> saith he, <hi>to chuse every one his faith, by his private judgement or wit
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:38584:53"/>
working upon disputable words.</hi> Which as far as we own it, is, not to believe what we see no ground for; and if this be such a <hi>distortion of humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> I envy not Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s. uprightness and perfection. If he means that we build our faith on our private judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in opposition to <hi>Scripture</hi> or the <hi>Universal Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> in all ages, let him prove it evidently in one particular, and I engage for my self and all true <hi>Protestants,</hi> we will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the belief of it. If he hath any thing further to object against the Grounds of our Religion, he knows where to attaque me; let him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the whole; or else acknowledge it a most unreasonable thing thus to charge falsities upon us, and then say we have nothing else to say for our selves. We pretend not to chuse our faith, but heartily embrace whatever appears to have been delivered by <hi>Christ</hi> or his <hi>Apostles;</hi> but we know the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> too well to believe all which she would impose upon us, and are loth to have her chuse our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion for us, since we know she hath chosen so ill for her self. But if Mr. <hi>S.</hi>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:38584:53"/>
will not believe me in saying thus, what reason have I to believe him in saying otherwise? such general char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges then signifie nothing, but every one must judge according to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son on both sides.</p>
                  <p>I now come to the last part of my <note place="margin">§. 17.</note> task; which is to shew, <hi>that this way is repugnant to common sense and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>hath apparently altered from what was the belief of former ages.</hi> To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose my words are: <hi>It is to no purpose to prove the impossibility of motion when I see men move; no more is it to prove that no age of the Church could vary from the preceding, when we can evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently prove that they have done it. And therefore this argument is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to catch easie minds that care not for a search into the history of the several ages of the Church, but had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sit down with a superficial subtilty, then spend time in further enquiries.</hi> But <hi>two things</hi> Mr. <hi>S.</hi> tells me, <hi>are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ere I can see that their faith va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">p. 238.</note> 
                     <hi>from the former. First to see what their Church holds now, and then to see
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:38584:54"/>
what the former Church held before; and he kindly tells me, if he sees any thing, I see neither well.</hi> It seems I want Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s. <hi>spectacles</hi> of oral tradition to see with; but as yet I have no cause to complain of the want of them, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> see much better without them, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> with them. He tells me, <hi>I cannot see what their present Church holds, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> therefore I cannot assure any what w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> held before; because if I renounce tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I take away all means of knowing. The reason why I cannot candidly see</hi> (as he phrases it) <hi>what their Church holds now, is, because I cannot distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between faith and its explication, some Schoolmen and the Church.</hi> By which it seems it is impossible for me to know what their Church holds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Invocation of Saints, Worship of Images, Communion in one kind;</hi> for those are the points I there mention, wherein it is evident that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> hath receded from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and practise of the Primitive Church. Or are these only the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and practises of some <hi>Schoolmen</hi> among them, and not the doctrine and practise of their <hi>Church?</hi> But that we
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:38584:54"/>
might come to some fuller state of these controversies, I wish M. <hi>S.</hi> would settle some sure way whereby we might know distinctly what are the doctrines and practises of their Church. If the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> and <hi>Roman-Catechism,</hi> be said to be the rule of <hi>doctrine,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire no other; so that those may be interpreted by practises universally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed among them. As when that <hi>Council</hi> only defined that <hi>due honour be given to Saints,</hi> the general practise of that <hi>Church</hi> may tell us what they mean by that <hi>due honour;</hi> and if that be not fair, I know not what is. But I see all the shift Mr. <hi>S.</hi> hath, is, when he is pinched,. to say <hi>those are the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Schoolmen and private specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators, and not the doctrine of their Church.</hi> And if such shifts as these are, must serve the turn, I should wonder if ever he be to seek for an answer. But the shortest answer of all would be that none but those of their Church can know what she holds; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is to no purpose for <hi>Protestants</hi> to write against her: or it may be, that none but Mr. <hi>S.</hi> and one or two more can tell; for many among them say,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:38584:55"/>
those are the doctrines of their <hi>Church</hi> which they deny to be. So that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Mr. <hi>White</hi> and Mr. <hi>S.</hi> and some very few <hi>demonstrators</hi> more, all the rest are <hi>Schoolmen, private opinators,</hi> and not to be relyed on. <hi>But I cannot see what their Church held formerly nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">p. 239.</note> No wonder at all of that; for if I cannot see an object so near me as the present <hi>Church,</hi> how can it be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted I should see one so much further off as the doctrine of former ages? And his reason is so strong as may well perswade me out of one at least of my five senses. <hi>For,</hi> saith he, <hi>if I question tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, I question whether there be any doctrine delivered, and so any Fathers.</hi> And is not this argued like a Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strator? First he supposes there never was any way used in the world but oral tradition, and then strongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, if I deny that, I can know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. But I can yet hardly perswade my self that the <hi>Fathers</hi> only sate in Chimney corners teaching their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by word of mouth, and charging them to be sure to do so to theirs; but as they loved preserving the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith, they should have a great
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:38584:55"/>
care never to write down a word of it. But why I wonder, should Mr. <hi>S.</hi> think that if I do not allow of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

purpose to prove that impossible which we see actually done. And this appears not only because the Scripture supposes a degeneracy in the Christian Church, which could never be, if every age of the Church did insa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For which I refer the Reader to what I had said about com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in one kind, Invocation of Saints, and worship of Images: In all which,</hi> I say, <hi>I had proved evidently that they were not in use in some ages of the Christian Church; and it is as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that these are delivered by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Church, and therefore this principle must needs be false.</hi> In answer to this, Mr. <hi>S.</hi> wishes, <hi>I would tell him first what evidence means, whether a strong fancy or a demonstration?</hi> I mean that which is enough to perswade a wise man who judges according to the clearest reason, which I am sure is more then ever his demonstrations will do. But it is a pleasant specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:38584:59"/>
to see how Mr. <hi>S.</hi> layes about him at my saying that the <hi>Scripture</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses a degeneracy in the Christian Church. <hi>Incomparably argued!</hi> saith he; <hi>why, see we not the place? does it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently speak of faith or manners, the Universal Church or particular persons? but be it in faith, be it universal, does it suppose this degeneracy already past, which is only proper to your purpose, or yet to come? That is, does it say there must be a total Apostacy in faith before the year</hi> 1664.? <hi>Alas he had forgot this.</hi> Most incomparably answered! For if the degeneracy be in 1665. or any years a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>monstration then, that no errors could come into the Church? but it seems his demonstration holds but till 1664. and I easily believe an other year will never believe the truth of it. But if such a thing as a degeneracy be possible, how then stands the infallibility of tradition? when there can be no degeneracy without falling from the doctrine and practices of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles.</hi> But that such a degeneracy hath already been in that which calls it self the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:38584:59"/>
and that both in faith and manners, I shall referr Mr. <hi>S.</hi> to the learned Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the late <hi>Idea of Antichristianism,</hi> and <hi>Synopsis Prophetica,</hi> where he may find enough to perswade him that his demonstration was far from holding so long as 1664. And now I leave the Reader to judge whether the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evidences against the infallibility of <hi>oral tradition,</hi> or Mr. <hi>S</hi>'s. demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations have the greater force of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in them. And if he will not <hi>stoop</hi> so far from the <hi>height</hi> of his <hi>perch</hi> as to take notice of what I have elsewhere said, I am resolved to let him see I am not at all concerned about it: I begin to understand him so well by this <hi>Appendix,</hi> that I can give my self a reasonable account why he thought it not sit to meddle with any other part of my book.

the grounds of faith; that all he pretends to in the title of his book, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>to excuse Catholick Religion against the opposition of several Adversaries.</hi> What fault I pray hath the <hi>Catholick Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> committed, that it must now come to be <hi>excused</hi> inst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ad of being <hi>defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi> But when I look into that part which concerns my self, I presently understand the meaning of it, which is not <hi>to excuse Catholick Religion,</hi> but <hi>themselves,</hi> for not being able to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend</hi> it. For he very ingenuously tells us, <hi>that faith is firm and constant,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 210.</note> 
               <hi>though all his talk for it be miserably weak: i. e.</hi> he is sure they have an excellent Religion, though he knows not what to say for it; and their faith is a very good faith, but it hath not yet had the good fortune to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by them. For he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, that <hi>as often as they dispute,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>p.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>they are beyond the business,</hi> (so may any one believe, who reads their late books,) which is in effect to say, there is no way left of disputing any longer with adversaries about their faith; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they must believe it stoutly them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
<pb facs="tcp:38584:61"/>
but it is to no purpose to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to defend it. Nay, it doth their faith a great deal of mischief; <hi>for,</hi> saith he, <hi>in reading controversies we see not so much the nature of the faith, as the wit of him who opposes or defends it.</hi> From whence we may easily gather what unspeakable mischief they do their cause by writing for it. By which expressions we may guess, at what a low ebbe the defence of their faith is among them: for the way now taken to defend it, is by disowning the defenders of it, and by saying, that they only vent their own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and though we confute them never so much, yet their faith holds good still. Was ever a good cause driven to such miserable shifts as these are, especially among those who pretend to wit and learning? One, he saith, <hi>T. C.</hi> vents a private opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his own, and it is not a pin matter whether it stand or fall; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he saith, the same of <hi>I. S.</hi> a third of <hi>J. V. C.</hi> and yet for all this, their religion is very firm and sure, and they all at perfect agreement

about it. Is this the <hi>victory over me</hi> Mr. <hi>S.</hi> mentions to be so easie a thing? I see that by the same figure Mr. <hi>S.</hi> calls his way of arguing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, running out of the field shall be accounted conquering.
